87,Definition 2: The importance of small waterbodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services: implications for policy makers,1,True,"Ponds are small standing waters varying in size from 1m<sup>2</sup> to about 2-5 ha in area and may be permanent or seasonal, man-made or naturally created. 

Large ponds and small lakes share many characteristics in terms of structure and function, and the transition zone between the two types of habitat is very gradual. Most authors have adopted a size-based classification with a size boundary somewhere between 1 and 5 ha.
</end_of_turn>",False
88,Definition 2: The importance of small waterbodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services: implications for policy makers,2,True,"Here are the definitions for ponds and lakes as given in the text:

**Ponds:** Include a wide variety of temporary waterbodies such as dune slack pools, vernal pools, rock pools, smaller pingos, playas and other temporary small standing waters which range from tiny puddles that might only hold water for a few days after rain, to more permanent waterbodies that may only dry up for a few weeks in most years and in some years remain permanently wet.

**Small Lakes:** Standing waters of greater than 1–5 ha up to around 50–100 ha. 

The text notes there is no strict definition for what constitutes small or large lakes, but 50 ha is considered a *de facto* cut-off point in Europe due to the Water Framework Directive.
