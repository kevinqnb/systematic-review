      "Ditches are man-made waterbodies although, particularly in flood plain and coastal grazing areas, their attributes (still or slow-flowing interconnected channels) are an analogue of the multi-thread and anatomising channels of the floodplains and coastal alluvial plains they often drain. This drainage is essential for maintaining productive agricultural areas around the globe: the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage has estimated that, globally, 190 million ha of agricultural lands are drained artificially, with most of that land in the Americas (65 Mha), Asia (58 Mha) and Europe (47 Mha), about 12% of the estimated 1,500 Mha of arable land and permanent crops (Ausubel et al., 2012;Leslie et al., 2012).The length of ditch networks has not been assessed globally or regionally, although they are extensive in agriculturally intensive countries. In the heavily drained Netherlands, the total length of ditches is around 300,000 km and ditch densities are 400-1000 m ditch per hectare (Verdonschot, 2012). In the United Kingdom, where ditch densities have been calculated for both lowland and upland landscapes, using data presented by Brown et al. (2006), it can be estimated that there are around 600,000 km of ditches, including small ditches which only flow intermittently. This is three to four times greater than the 165,000 km length of the river and stream network (Maltby et al., 2011).\n",

      "The available evidence indicates that ditches experience the same spatial extent of water pollution as is seen in the rest of the water environment, with in excess of 90% of ditches having nutrient levels associated with biological impairment of communities (Williams et al., 2004;Biggs et al., 2014b). However, because ditches often have quite small catchments, they also offer greater opportunities for protection from water pollution than larger waterbodies. This can be seen in the heterogeneity of water quality when compared to other freshwater habitats. For example, Biggs et al. (2014b) in a stratified random sample of waterbodies in the lowland English farmed landscape found that ditches surveyed in late winter/early spring generally had the greatest range of values in most of the common water quality determinants including nutrients, heavy metals and organic pollutants. As a result of this, networks of ditches in areas draining land which is not farmed intensively, especially in old wetlands, can be reservoirs of water with nearnatural nutrient, and other potential pollutant, levels. This is one of the main factors explaining the exceptional biodiversity of such sites.\n",

Field observations of smaller waters are generally necessary because of the difficulty of remotely sensing (a) waters beneath trees (although it may be possible to solve this problem (Wu et al., 2014), (b) temporary waters, which will often be dry when surveys are undertaken and undetectable by satellites looking for water, but are often readily identifiable on the ground by analysing vegetation patterns, and (c) in wetland environments, where an element of biological knowledge is needed to separate ponds and small lakes from other wetland types (e.g. mires, fens). Downing et al. (2006) originally suggested that the area of lakes and ponds up to 10 ha was about 30% of the global total standing water area. Although more conservative estimates are probably appropriate (e.g. Holgerson & Raymond, 2016), it is clear that small standing waters make an important contribution to the global total freshwater area.\n",

      "Ponds are small lentic ecosystems that permanently or temporarily hold water [1]. They are shallow and their size ranges from a few square metres to several hectares. They can be natural or man-made. Their number is much higher than that of large lakes, which constitute a small percentage of the total number of lakes [2]. Despite this, studies of lentic ecosystems have concentrated mainly on moderately large lakes [2].Ponds differ functionally from larger lakes [3], since their littoral structure and its productivity dominates the ecosystem [2]. Despite their small size they contain a significant part of aquatic biodiversity on the landscape scale [4,5]. Humans have created millions of ponds for multiple purposes [2], but today they serve as refugia for a variety of freshwater biota [5] and are, as such, an irreplaceable type of habitat [6][7][8].The biotic communities that develop in ponds depend on environmental conditions and human activity. Several studies document clear associations between the communities and a variety of environmental gradients, such as hydro-period [9,10], surface area [11], and water properties like water transparency, nutrient availability, and pH [12][13][14]. Compared to rivers and lakes, ponds exhibit greater environmental and, consequently, biotic amplitudes [15].\n",

      "Content: Although it has traditionally been assumed that ponds are 'isolated islands in a sea of dry land', they clearly form networks linked by physical and biological processes, not just with other ponds but with all other kinds of freshwater habitat. This is reflected in the fact that, at least in north temperate environments, a large proportion of the freshwater species in any landscape is found in a range of waterbody types, including both still and flowing waters. For example, in the landscape of southern England (Williams et al., 2004) (Fig. 2, unpublished data) found that in a stratified random sample of ponds, rivers, streams and ditches, of 230 aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa recorded, 33% were found only in ponds, 32% only in rivers and 45% in both ponds and rivers. This points to the existence of 'freshwater landscapes' in which plants and animals move around a network of habitats, small and large, all of which contribute to the protection of freshwater biodiversity (Sayer, 2014). It seems quite likely that this trend is fairly general, at least in the temperate zone, although there are currently few data available to test the idea.\n",

      "Content: ## Ecosystem services provided by ditches and springs\n",
      "Comparatively little information is available concerning the contribution of ditches and spring to ecosystem services other than their specific drainage function. Clearly, it is axiomatic that ditches provide a very substantial land drainage and flood control function (Smedema et al., 2004), as well as contributing similar ecosystem services to those known for natural and constructed ponds and wetlands (see review by Dollinger et al., 2015). As in other small waters, the potential for ditches to provide ecosystem services varies substantially. For example, Dollinger et al. (2015) conclude that the reduction in nutrient loads along a ditch reach varies from 3 to 92% depending on the nutrient considered and the characteristics of ditches. They note that total nitrogen and phosphorus are preferentially reduced along ditches with regard to nitrates and ammonium. Similarly, reductions in pesticides vary widely from 5 to 95%.Since ancient times, the most obvious ecosystem service provided by springs is drinking water supply. Other services include hot water either for heating purposes such as in Iceland or for bathing. This is then often coupled with high mineral content and is proposed to have therapeutic values. Already in Roman times, hot spring water was used for leisure activities and also Japanese macaques are famous for taking hot baths in spring water. Spring water is also irreplaceable for brewing and it is still important for livestock watering and crop irrigation (Glazier, 2014).\n",

      "Content: Although there is ample evidence of hydrologic, chemical and biological links between these 'upstream' and 'downstream' waterbodies, few studies specifically address the magnitude of these fluxes. Some effects of ponds and wetlands on downstream waters are due to their isolation, rather than their connectivity, particularly because of the wetland's ability to isolate material fluxes (US EPA, 2015). Finally, small-scale water supply is provided by ponds throughout the world but has attracted little scientific attention. In Eurasia, small-scale water storage using ponds has occurred for centuries and many ponds in Europe have been created for water supply reasons. In the Americas, as agricultural intensification continues, a large number of agricultural ponds have been created, probably having a substantial, but little investigated, impact on hydrology. For example, small farm ponds are now the dominant lentic ecosystem in the Great Plains of the United States (Huggins et al., 2011) and are common in parts of Brazil (Bichsel et al. 2016).Importance and ecosystem services of small streams A considerable number of papers have documented the importance of small streams and headwaters but few have done so from the perspective of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services, or direct and indirect benefits, humans derive from headwaters include water provision, recharge of ground waters, flood control, trapping of sediment and pollutants, nutrients recycling, maintenance of biological diversity and support of downstream water quality and productivity (Meyer & Wallace, 2001;Meyer et al., 2007a).\n",

Given that the vegetation on this transect was substantially shorter (6 cm compared to 15 and 23 cm on Transects 1 and 2, respectively), wave heights were 2e3 cm smaller, and water depths comparable to Transects 1 and 2, this suggests that (a) the canopy height on this transect was too low to allow the vegetation to occupy a large enough proportion of the water column, and/or (b) waves were too small to be affected by the vegetated layer. Furthermore, the different vegetation type (Salicornia instead of Spartina) provides greater flexibility for movement with the flow (i.e. reduced flow resistance). This, together with the significant decrease in vegetation density, may explain why, even in high H s /h conditions of over 0.4 in December, attenuation remained low (<20%) on this transect, while it exceeded 30% on some occasions on the other two transects.\n",

Benthic respiration measurements were assumed to be representative for the entire lake and the full year. This is obviously a crude assumption which does not account for spatial and temporal variability in the amount of labile organic matter. We regard the incubation temperature of 12°C as a suitable choice because if respiration rates change with temperature with a standard Q 10 -value of 2.0, annual means of respiration rates corrected to monthly temperatures over the year available for two lakes in the region (Closter 2007) yielded values within ±5% of the value at 12°C.\n",

Lakes were sampled in a random order to avoid bias from changing meteorological conditions during the study. Throughout the study, meteorological conditions were measured from a buoy placed on Lake Slotssø. Daily average wind speed (0.3-5.4 m s -1 , min-max) and solar irradiance (5-55 mol photons m -2 day -1 ) showed large daily variability, but did not change significantly during the course of the study. Lakes were chosen to cover large ranges in lake size, forest cover, TP, Chl and DOC concentrations. Lake area, catchment area, %forest cover in the catchment and drainage ratio (catchment area:lake area) were obtained for each lake using the digital Areal Information System (Nielsen et al. 2000). To evaluate effects of forest cover on local wind and light conditions, we also determined the proportion of forest in the 200 m wide riparian zone around the lakes from aerial photographs.\n",

(2007), in a study in the north-eastern United States, concluded that first-order headwaters contribute approximately 70% of the water volume and 65% of the nitrogen flux in second-order streams and that their contributions to mean water volume and nitrogen flux decline only marginally to about 55 and 40% in fourth-order and higher order rivers that include navigable waters and their tributaries. Other studies also attribute a high proportion of surface water, nutrient and organic matter retention to headwater capture (Meyer & Wallace, 2001;MacDonald & Coe, 2007;Hill et al., 2014).

      "Small waterbodies include natural, artificial and heavily modified waterbodies. They are important in their own right, and also important for their influence on larger waters. They are the commonplace freshwater habitats in virtually all landscapes but have been overlooked by freshwater science until recently. They are often both the most and least degraded remaining examples of freshwater habitats because their small catchments make them both more vulnerable to stresses, and more likely to escape those stresses. Despite this, they still largely lie outside the mainstream of freshwater science and policy making although practitioners, landowners and ordinary people are as likely to interact with them as a great lake or large river.The protection and management of small waterbodies presents a substantial, and achievable, opportunity to protect an important component of the freshwater environment. We encourage policy makers and legislators to help facilitate this goal.### Fig\n",

      "Content: Because of their size, small waterbodies are easier to protect than larger waters and there is evidence that it may be easier to maintain them in a near-natural condition (in the terminology of the WFD, at 'High' status). There is also good evidence that ponds and small lakes can be created in a way which mimics natural processes and can be used to help restore freshwater biodiversity at landscape level, increasing Polygon size provides a measure of macroinvertebrate assemblage heterogeneity showing that rivers have the least, and ponds and ditches the most, heterogeneous assemblages. Triangle = ditches, filled square = ponds, filled circle = streams, circle = rivers. From Williams et al. (2004) connectivity, resilience and biodiversity. In terms of restoration of existing freshwaters, current evidence indicates that the vast majority of stream restoration projects rarely demonstrate a biodiversity recovery post-hydrogeomorphic adjustment (Palmer et al., 2014;Law et al., 2016), and increasingly emphasise the critical need to improve water quality (e.g. Turunen et al., 2016), which may be more achievable in small rather than larger waters. This is in part because small waters are more likely to have catchments dominated by predominantly 'water-friendly' land uses which are less likely to act as pollutant sources, such as natural forest, extensive grasslands, high-nature-value farmland or other natural or seminatural vegetation types. However, restoration of water quality in small streams in high-intensity agricultural catchments is more challenging. Finally, because small waterbodies are also both common and 'people friendly', they are ideal habitats with which to engage individual citizens in water policy decision making and practical action.Overall, policy makers and legislators need to develop clear processes for assessing the status of smaller waters and ensuring their effective management in catchment plans. Small waterbodies are abundant, and many are badly degraded, so it is necessary to identify important sites based on high biodiversity, high water quality or other valuable attributes. These should be identified in catchment plans and measures implemented for their protection.\n",

Haynes (2016) reported that the task was problematic, as halophytes tended to disappear within 2 m of the edge of the reedbed and devised a method of distinguishing the two types on the basis of adjacent landward vegetation, but also noted that saline influence could extend into reedbeds via excavated channels.

Furthermore, as noted by Moore & Richardson (2003) not all small streams are headwaters. Despite this, most small streams probably lie within headwater reaches. Headwater streams have been defined by Furse et al.

Some small coastal streams are first-and at most second-order channels for their entire length which often extends to just a few kilometres (Whelan, 2014).\n",

      "Content: Loading of DOC to lakes has previously been associated with the amount of wetlands in the watershed (Gergel et al. 1999), in particular wetlands with coniferous vegetation (Xenopoulos et al. 2003). The catchments of our study lakes had a small share of wetlands (0-7%), and DOC concentration was better related to the proportion of forest in the catchments, suggesting that regional models have limited applicability in predicting DOC in other geographical areas of the world (Xenopoulos et al. 2003). The strong influence of lake area and forest cover on lake DOC (Fig. 3a, b) supports two explanations. Firstly, hydrological input of DOC and nutrients across the terrestrial-aquatic boundary increases when the drainage ratio (catchment area to lake surface area) is high. Secondly, small lakes possess a long shoreline for input of air-born terrestrial organic matter relative to lake surface area and volume and receive significant amounts of organic matter from litter fall (Gasith and Hasler 1976). The implications of higher DOC for physical and biological processes were firstly, shallower surface mixed layers and reduced light penetration (Snucins and Gunn 2000;Houser 2006) secondly, reduced planktonic production and increased planktonic respiration (Del Giorgio and Peters 1994), and finally, increased ecosystem respiration through mineralization of allochthonous organic carbon (Hanson et al. 2003;Staehr et al. 2010a).\n",

      "Each pond was sampled once during the summer months (June to early August) from 1996 to 2005 following the PLOCH method (Oertli et al., 2005b). Mayflies were collected using a small hand-net (rectangular frame 14 9 10 cm, mesh size 0.5 mm).For each sample, the net was swept intensively through the pre-selected dominant habitats for 30 s. In all cases, the collected material was preserved in either 4% formaldehyde or 70% alcohol solutions and then sorted in the laboratory.The physico-chemistry of the water was measured during winter and summer months, as described by Oertli et al. (2000), by establishing a profile using WTW field probes down to the deepest point of the pond (to measure conductivity, pH and oxygen concentration). The transparency was additionally recorded from a surface water sample using a Snellen tube. Laboratory analyses of the content of TP and TN were made with winter water samples. TP concentrations and TN concentrations were then used to classify each pond into one of the four following trophic categories: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic or hypertrophic, as described by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1982) and Wetzel (1983).\n",

      "Content: We found that maximum emissions from chambers were 80% and 24% lower than CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes measured by EC. This was in opposition to findings of Krauss et al. (2016) where respiratory CH 4 and CO 2 emissions were compared over 5 sampling periods at a brackish Gulf Coast marsh populated by S. patens. Although pairwise comparisons with representative time periods from EC were not explicitly tested, maximum emissions recorded from chambers were 317% and 44% higher than CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes measured by EC, respectively. One contrasting feature is the limited microtidal range and sediment supply of Gulf Coast marshes (Holmquist et al., 2021). This acts to restrict deposition and levee development resulting primarily in vegetated flats or areas of open water which persistently occupies a higher proportion of the total area. Thus, while the plot-scale fluxes were likely representative of contributions from vegetated flats, considerable areas of open water and tidal creeks were also integrated with EC where fluxes are likely lower or masked by lateral transport across system boundaries (Cai, 2011;Trifunovic et al., 2020).\n",

      "Field measurements of vegetation were collected at 18 locations (six locations near each of the three transects: three between the wave recording instruments and three in the immediate vicinity (but outside) of the transect) during the September and December field visits. At all 18 locations, digital side-on photographs of a 0.6 m wide and 0.2 m deep strip of vegetation were taken against a red background plate (to provide maximum colour contrast against the brown to green tones of the vegetation). The field methodology was initially developed for saltmarsh environments by Mo ¨ller (2000) and, in parallel, for grasslands by Zehm et al. (2003). Further development has led to the methodology adopted for the purpose of this study, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The method used in this study differed from that of Zehm et al. (2003) in a number of important respects in order to adapt it to use in saltmarsh environments:\n",
      "(1) a rigid plastic (slightly textured) board (matt red colour finish, to reduce reflection and maximise contrast against vegetation) was used as a background to the photograph instead of an opaque cloth (optionally white or black), which was thought to be too sensitive to wind disturbance on exposed saltmarsh environments and would not give sufficient colour contrast in dim light conditions; (2) a smaller area (0.6 m wide and 0.2 m deep) was photographed, as the area used by Zehm et al. (2003) (1.0 m wide and 0.3 m deep) was thought to be too large (and too deep) for dense saltmarsh vegetation (it would not allow subtle differences in vegetation density to be distinguished); and (3) the vegetation in front of the photographed plot was pressed to the ground with a plastic sheet held within the photographic frame, rather than a tarpaulin (which was found to be inadequate for the more rigid and dense saltmarsh vegetation).\n",

      "Content: Elsewhere in Europe (Ireland, Denmark, Germany, France), ditch systems have been found to be similar to (Davies et al., 2008a, b;Verdonschot et al., 2011) or exceed (Kavanagh & Harrison, 2014) streams, in a or c diversity, and to support similar numbers of endangered species to semi-natural small lakes (Verdonschot et al., 2011). In North America, studies of ditches are still at an early stage but work in Florida (Simon & Travis, 2011) confirms that they can make a similar contribution to regional freshwater biodiversity to that seen in Europe. Away from floodplains, where many ditches are seasonal, they are often more impoverished, but even these seasonal ditches may support uncommon species not recorded in other waterbody types at regional level (Williams et al., 2004).

We are aware of only one long-term repeat survey of a group of ponds (Nicolet, 2000). Additionally, important knowledge often remains largely anecdotal: for example, one pond first surveyed in the 1970s (Palmer, 1973), and subsequently revisited over more than 40 years, provides the only currently available evidence of the potential for pond plant communities to remain exceptionally rich, and retain specific endangered species, over reasonable lengths of time (Palmer, 2010).\n",

      "Ultimately all attempts at producing accurate figures for extent of coastal habitats are no more than a \"best assessment\" based on a snapshot in time. Firstly, coastal environments are dynamic, so all interpretations of extent must accommodate this. Secondly, there will always be [scale-dependent] areas of the selected habitat that are smaller than the mapping base, so that totals will under-record the incidence of the habitat. Thirdly, habitat survey is highly subjective and Table 5 UK Ellenberg values for salinity of main species (constancy III-Vpresent in at least 41% of stands) of SM NVC Communities omitted from JNCC saltmarsh definitions (source of values Hill et al., 2004, with European averages (where given) from Tichý et al.

      "Overall, it is clear that small waterbodies are exceptionally abundant globally and that their numbers and distribution are strongly affected by human activity. Large numbers of ponds and small lakes, and all ditches, have been created by people and perhaps similar, or greater, numbers of natural small waters destroyed. Small streams and springs, on the other hand, are rarely created by human activity, but have often been eliminated, or reduced in extent, by the modification of physical structure or water supply.\n",

      "Ponds are small lentic ecosystems that permanently or temporarily hold water [1]. They are shallow and their size ranges from a few square metres to several hectares. They can be natural or man-made. Their number is much higher than that of large lakes, which constitute a small percentage of the total number of lakes [2]. Despite this, studies of lentic ecosystems have concentrated mainly on moderately large lakes [2].Ponds differ functionally from larger lakes [3], since their littoral structure and its productivity dominates the ecosystem [2]. Despite their small size they contain a significant part of aquatic biodiversity on the landscape scale [4,5]. Humans have created millions of ponds for multiple purposes [2], but today they serve as refugia for a variety of freshwater biota [5] and are, as such, an irreplaceable type of habitat [6][7][8].The biotic communities that develop in ponds depend on environmental conditions and human activity. Several studies document clear associations between the communities and a variety of environmental gradients, such as hydro-period [9,10], surface area [11], and water properties like water transparency, nutrient availability, and pH [12][13][14]. Compared to rivers and lakes, ponds exhibit greater environmental and, consequently, biotic amplitudes [15].\n",

Field observations of smaller waters are generally necessary because of the difficulty of remotely sensing (a) waters beneath trees (although it may be possible to solve this problem (Wu et al., 2014), (b) temporary waters, which will often be dry when surveys are undertaken and undetectable by satellites looking for water, but are often readily identifiable on the ground by analysing vegetation patterns, and (c) in wetland environments, where an element of biological knowledge is needed to separate ponds and small lakes from other wetland types (e.g. mires, fens). Downing et al. (2006) originally suggested that the area of lakes and ponds up to 10 ha was about 30% of the global total standing water area. Although more conservative estimates are probably appropriate (e.g. Holgerson & Raymond, 2016), it is clear that small standing waters make an important contribution to the global total freshwater area.\n",

This is reflected in the fact that, at least in north temperate environments, a large proportion of the freshwater species in any landscape is found in a range of waterbody types, including both still and flowing waters. For example, in the landscape of southern England (Williams et al., 2004) (Fig. 2, unpublished data) found that in a stratified random sample of ponds, rivers, streams and ditches, of 230 aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa recorded, 33% were found only in ponds, 32% only in rivers and 45% in both ponds and rivers. This points to the existence of 'freshwater landscapes' in which plants and animals move around a network of habitats, small and large, all of which contribute to the protection of freshwater biodiversity (Sayer, 2014). It seems quite likely that this trend is fairly general, at least in the temperate zone, although there are currently few data available to test the idea.\n",

In terms of restoration of existing freshwaters, current evidence indicates that the vast majority of stream restoration projects rarely demonstrate a biodiversity recovery post-hydrogeomorphic adjustment (Palmer et al., 2014;Law et al., 2016), and increasingly emphasise the critical need to improve water quality (e.g. Turunen et al., 2016), which may be more achievable in small rather than larger waters. This is in part because small waters are more likely to have catchments dominated by predominantly 'water-friendly' land uses which are less likely to act as pollutant sources, such as natural forest, extensive grasslands, high-nature-value farmland or other natural or seminatural vegetation types. However, restoration of water quality in small streams in high-intensity agricultural catchments is more challenging. Finally, because small waterbodies are also both common and 'people friendly', they are ideal habitats with which to engage individual citizens in water policy decision making and practical action.Overall, policy makers and legislators need to develop clear processes for assessing the status of smaller waters and ensuring their effective management in catchment plans. Small waterbodies are abundant, and many are badly degraded, so it is necessary to identify important sites based on high biodiversity, high water quality or other valuable attributes. These should be identified in catchment plans and measures implemented for their protection.\n",

Some effects of ponds and wetlands on downstream waters are due to their isolation, rather than their connectivity, particularly because of the wetland's ability to isolate material fluxes (US EPA, 2015). Finally, small-scale water supply is provided by ponds throughout the world but has attracted little scientific attention. In Eurasia, small-scale water storage using ponds has occurred for centuries and many ponds in Europe have been created for water supply reasons. In the Americas, as agricultural intensification continues, a large number of agricultural ponds have been created, probably having a substantial, but little investigated, impact on hydrology. For example, small farm ponds are now the dominant lentic ecosystem in the Great Plains of the United States (Huggins et al., 2011) and are common in parts of Brazil (Bichsel et al. 2016).Importance and ecosystem services of small streams A considerable number of papers have documented the importance of small streams and headwaters but few have done so from the perspective of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services, or direct and indirect benefits, humans derive from headwaters include water provision, recharge of ground waters, flood control, trapping of sediment and pollutants, nutrients recycling, maintenance of biological diversity and support of downstream water quality and productivity (Meyer & Wallace, 2001;Meyer et al., 2007a).\n",

      "Small waterbodies include natural, artificial and heavily modified waterbodies. They are important in their own right, and also important for their influence on larger waters. They are the commonplace freshwater habitats in virtually all landscapes but have been overlooked by freshwater science until recently. They are often both the most and least degraded remaining examples of freshwater habitats because their small catchments make them both more vulnerable to stresses, and more likely to escape those stresses. Despite this, they still largely lie outside the mainstream of freshwater science and policy making although practitioners, landowners and ordinary people are as likely to interact with them as a great lake or large river.The protection and management of small waterbodies presents a substantial, and achievable, opportunity to protect an important component of the freshwater environment. We encourage policy makers and legislators to help facilitate this goal.### Fig\n",

This drainage is essential for maintaining productive agricultural areas around the globe: the International Commission on Irrigation and Drainage has estimated that, globally, 190 million ha of agricultural lands are drained artificially, with most of that land in the Americas (65 Mha), Asia (58 Mha) and Europe (47 Mha), about 12% of the estimated 1,500 Mha of arable land and permanent crops (Ausubel et al., 2012;Leslie et al., 2012).The length of ditch networks has not been assessed globally or regionally, although they are extensive in agriculturally intensive countries. In the heavily drained Netherlands, the total length of ditches is around 300,000 km and ditch densities are 400-1000 m ditch per hectare (Verdonschot, 2012). In the United Kingdom, where ditch densities have been calculated for both lowland and upland landscapes, using data presented by Brown et al. (2006), it can be estimated that there are around 600,000 km of ditches, including small ditches which only flow intermittently. This is three to four times greater than the 165,000 km length of the river and stream network (Maltby et al., 2011).\n",

Headwater streams have been defined by Furse et al.

In all cases, the collected material was preserved in either 4% formaldehyde or 70% alcohol solutions and then sorted in the laboratory.The physico-chemistry of the water was measured during winter and summer months, as described by Oertli et al. (2000), by establishing a profile using WTW field probes down to the deepest point of the pond (to measure conductivity, pH and oxygen concentration). The transparency was additionally recorded from a surface water sample using a Snellen tube. Laboratory analyses of the content of TP and TN were made with winter water samples. TP concentrations and TN concentrations were then used to classify each pond into one of the four following trophic categories: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic or hypertrophic, as described by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1982) and Wetzel (1983).\n",

Clearly, it is axiomatic that ditches provide a very substantial land drainage and flood control function (Smedema et al., 2004), as well as contributing similar ecosystem services to those known for natural and constructed ponds and wetlands (see review by Dollinger et al., 2015). As in other small waters, the potential for ditches to provide ecosystem services varies substantially. For example, Dollinger et al. (2015) conclude that the reduction in nutrient loads along a ditch reach varies from 3 to 92% depending on the nutrient considered and the characteristics of ditches. They note that total nitrogen and phosphorus are preferentially reduced along ditches with regard to nitrates and ammonium. Similarly, reductions in pesticides vary widely from 5 to 95%.Since ancient times, the most obvious ecosystem service provided by springs is drinking water supply. Other services include hot water either for heating purposes such as in Iceland or for bathing. This is then often coupled with high mineral content and is proposed to have therapeutic values. Already in Roman times, hot spring water was used for leisure activities and also Japanese macaques are famous for taking hot baths in spring water. Spring water is also irreplaceable for brewing and it is still important for livestock watering and crop irrigation (Glazier, 2014).\n",

The catchments of our study lakes had a small share of wetlands (0-7%), and DOC concentration was better related to the proportion of forest in the catchments, suggesting that regional models have limited applicability in predicting DOC in other geographical areas of the world (Xenopoulos et al. 2003). The strong influence of lake area and forest cover on lake DOC (Fig. 3a, b) supports two explanations. Firstly, hydrological input of DOC and nutrients across the terrestrial-aquatic boundary increases when the drainage ratio (catchment area to lake surface area) is high. Secondly, small lakes possess a long shoreline for input of air-born terrestrial organic matter relative to lake surface area and volume and receive significant amounts of organic matter from litter fall (Gasith and Hasler 1976). The implications of higher DOC for physical and biological processes were firstly, shallower surface mixed layers and reduced light penetration (Snucins and Gunn 2000;Houser 2006) secondly, reduced planktonic production and increased planktonic respiration (Del Giorgio and Peters 1994), and finally, increased ecosystem respiration through mineralization of allochthonous organic carbon (Hanson et al. 2003;Staehr et al. 2010a).\n",

However, because ditches often have quite small catchments, they also offer greater opportunities for protection from water pollution than larger waterbodies. This can be seen in the heterogeneity of water quality when compared to other freshwater habitats. For example, Biggs et al.

      "Content: The statutory nature conservation body Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH, now NatureScot) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), organisations reporting for the Habitats Directive and WFD respectively, specified that the contractor for their jointly commissioned Scottish Saltmarsh Survey should distinguish between fresh-water reedbeds S4 Phragmites and reedbeds influenced by saline input. Haynes (2016) reported that the task was problematic, as halophytes tended to disappear within 2 m of the edge of the reedbed and devised a method of distinguishing the two types on the basis of adjacent landward vegetation, but also noted that saline influence could extend into reedbeds via excavated channels. Full sea water usually has a salinity of around 34-35, and Chapman (1960) gives the maximum salinity \"tolerated\" by Phragmites as 27.5. Packer et al. (2017) reported that Phragmites australis becomes stressed at salinities greater than 12 and is killed by salinity exceeding 30, i.e. by saline water. Phragmites australis has a complex osmoregulatory mechanism which can also be influenced by microbial activity around its rhizomes (Borruso et al., 2014). Hill et al. (2004) give Phragmites australis a salinity Ellenberg value of 2, while Tichý et al. (2023) give it a value of 1.6. The highest value recorded by the latter across Europe was 3.0 in France and Italy.\n",

      "Content: Benthic respiration was measured in triplicate sediment cores retrieved in Kajak Perspex cylinders (5.2 cm in diameter) from the central part of the lakes in April-May and incubated in the dark at 12°C for 1-2 days. Oxygen consumption was Net Heterotrophy in Small Lakes determined as the rate of decline of dissolved O 2 in the enclosed water volume overlying the sediment. Water was stirred by a magnetic stirrer bar during incubation. Benthic respiration was corrected for respiration in the water overlying the sediment cores by parallel incubation of water alone. Benthic respiration measurements were assumed to be representative for the entire lake and the full year. This is obviously a crude assumption which does not account for spatial and temporal variability in the amount of labile organic matter. We regard the incubation temperature of 12°C as a suitable choice because if respiration rates change with temperature with a standard Q 10 -value of 2.0, annual means of respiration rates corrected to monthly temperatures over the year available for two lakes in the region (Closter 2007) yielded values within ±5% of the value at 12°C.\n",

      "Content: The vegetation is typical of the floristically diverse east coast saltmarshes of the British Isles (Adam, 1988). Midmarsh communities are typified by Limonium vulgare, Puccinellia maritima and Atriplex portulacoides. Near the seaward edge of the vegetated zone, a pioneer/seasonal marsh exists, characterised by Salicornia spp., Spartina anglica, Aster tripolium and Suaeda maritima. The vegetation exists in distinct patches of several square meters in size, dominated by individual species, such that it is possible to identify approximately uniform vegetation types in close proximity to each other (i.e. experiencing similar hydrodynamic conditions).\n",

      "### Mapping\n",
      "Ultimately all attempts at producing accurate figures for extent of coastal habitats are no more than a \"best assessment\" based on a snapshot in time. Firstly, coastal environments are dynamic, so all interpretations of extent must accommodate this. Secondly, there will always be [scale-dependent] areas of the selected habitat that are smaller than the mapping base, so that totals will under-record the incidence of the habitat. Thirdly, habitat survey is highly subjective and Table 5 UK Ellenberg values for salinity of main species (constancy III-Vpresent in at least 41% of stands) of SM NVC Communities omitted from JNCC saltmarsh definitions (source of values Hill et al., 2004, with European averages (where given) from Tichý et al.

      "Content: We found that maximum emissions from chambers were 80% and 24% lower than CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes measured by EC. This was in opposition to findings of Krauss et al. (2016) where respiratory CH 4 and CO 2 emissions were compared over 5 sampling periods at a brackish Gulf Coast marsh populated by S. patens. Although pairwise comparisons with representative time periods from EC were not explicitly tested, maximum emissions recorded from chambers were 317% and 44% higher than CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes measured by EC, respectively. One contrasting feature is the limited microtidal range and sediment supply of Gulf Coast marshes (Holmquist et al., 2021). This acts to restrict deposition and levee development resulting primarily in vegetated flats or areas of open water which persistently occupies a higher proportion of the total area. Thus, while the plot-scale fluxes were likely representative of contributions from vegetated flats, considerable areas of open water and tidal creeks were also integrated with EC where fluxes are likely lower or masked by lateral transport across system boundaries (Cai, 2011;Trifunovic et al., 2020).\n",

      "Content: ### Vegetation measurements\n",
      "Field measurements of vegetation were collected at 18 locations (six locations near each of the three transects: three between the wave recording instruments and three in the immediate vicinity (but outside) of the transect) during the September and December field visits. At all 18 locations, digital side-on photographs of a 0.6 m wide and 0.2 m deep strip of vegetation were taken against a red background plate (to provide maximum colour contrast against the brown to green tones of the vegetation). The field methodology was initially developed for saltmarsh environments by Mo ¨ller (2000) and, in parallel, for grasslands by Zehm et al. (2003). Further development has led to the methodology adopted for the purpose of this study, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The method used in this study differed from that of Zehm et al. (2003) in a number of important respects in order to adapt it to use in saltmarsh environments:\n",
      "(1) a rigid plastic (slightly textured) board (matt red colour finish, to reduce reflection and maximise contrast against vegetation) was used as a background to the photograph instead of an opaque cloth (optionally white or black), which was thought to be too sensitive to wind disturbance on exposed saltmarsh environments and would not give sufficient colour contrast in dim light conditions; (2) a smaller area (0.6 m wide and 0.2 m deep) was photographed, as the area used by Zehm et al. (2003) (1.0 m wide and 0.3 m deep) was thought to be too large (and too deep) for dense saltmarsh vegetation (it would not allow subtle differences in vegetation density to be distinguished); and (3) the vegetation in front of the photographed plot was pressed to the ground with a plastic sheet held within the photographic frame, rather than a tarpaulin (which was found to be inadequate for the more rigid and dense saltmarsh vegetation).\n",
