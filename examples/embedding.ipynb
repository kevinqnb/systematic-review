      "# Drivers of carbon dioxide and methane supersaturation in small, temporary ponds\n",
      "## Abstract\n",
      "Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle, but there is a poor understanding of carbon dynamics in very small ponds. In this study, I evaluated the concentrations and drivers of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) in six small (\\1000 m 2 ), temporary, forested ponds in Connecticut, USA. The six ponds were on average 19-fold supersaturated in CO 2 and 504-fold supersaturated in CH 4 relative to the atmosphere. For both gases, this level of supersaturation is among the highest reported for lentic freshwaters. The physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the ponds differ from larger lakes, and may explain the supersaturation. Specifically, the ponds have high terrestrial carbon loadings, are shallow, and polymictic, meaning much of the water is in contact with the carbon-rich sediments. Pond CO 2 concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that substantial respiration, likely from the sediments, drew down oxygen (O 2 ) and produced CO 2 . The stoichiometric relationship between CO 2 supersaturation and O 2 undersaturation also implicates anaerobic respiration as a significant source of CO 2 production in the ponds. The high carbon, low oxygen, and shallow nature of small ponds were also prime for CH 4 supersaturation. Methane concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with precipitation, likely because precipitation increased pond depth, diluted dissolved organic carbon and gas concentrations, and increased DO. If the respiration of terrestrial carbon in small ponds is not accounted for in carbon budgets, current estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may be overestimated.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Introduction\n",
      "Inland waters play an important role in the global carbon cycle. While estimated to comprise only 2.2-3.7 % of the earth's non-glaciated land area (Raymond et al. 2013;Verpoorter et al. 2014), inland waters process the same amount of carbon as both net terrestrial productivity and net oceanic uptake (Aufdenkampe et al. 2011;Battin et al. 2009). Yet, estimates of global carbon flux from inland waters are ridden with uncertainty (Raymond et al. 2013) and finer-scale studies are needed to determine carbon concentrations in global waters (Battin et al. 2009).\n",
      "One source of uncertainty in global carbon budgets is the role of small ponds. The majority of studies on carbon cycling in lentic systems have focused on medium-to large-sized lakes. Yet the vast majority of ponds and lakes are small: over 90 % of all ponds and lakes are\\0.01 km 2 (Downing et al. 2006;Verpoorter et al. 2014), not including very small ponds (0.0001-0.001 km 2 ) which could number as high as 3.2 billion and cover 0.8 million km 2 of surface area (Downing 2010). However, small ponds\\0.1 km 2 are difficult to map (Lehner and Do ¨ll 2004) and even highresolution satellite images cannot accurately identify ponds\\0.002 km 2 (Verpoorter et al. 2014). Due to the uncertainty of their distribution, very small ponds (\\0.001 km 2 ) remain difficult to assess in regional and global biogeochemical models, and are excluded.\n",
      "Regardless of their areal extent, small ponds may be hotspots for carbon cycling. Small and shallow ponds receive high loadings of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) relative to their water volume, which increases respiration and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production (Hope et al. 1996;Kelly et al. 2001;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rubbo et al. 2006). Methane (CH 4 ) concentrations also tend to be greater in small ponds because more water is in contact with anoxic sediments and shallow waters reduce the amount of CH 4 oxidation that occurs between the sediments and surface waters (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). As CH 4 has a global warming potential about 25 times higher than CO 2 , its contribution to carbon budgets should not be overlooked (Bastviken et al. 2011).\n",
      "Although small, shallow ponds are abundant and may be highly saturated with carbon gases, few studies have evaluated the concentrations, fluxes, and drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 in very small ponds. The studies that have done so indicate that small ponds (B0.01 km 2 ) have some of the highest CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in both boreal and temperate regions (Table 1). Due to their high concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 , is possible that carbon flux from small ponds \\0.01 km 2 may match that of larger lakes on both a local (Abnizova et al. 2012) and a global (Torgersen and Branco 2008) scale.\n",
      "Yet the paucity of studies on carbon dynamics in small ponds, particularly in temperate regions, limits our understanding of inland water carbon cycling. It is imperative to know both the concentrations and mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturation in small freshwaters. As very small ponds have unique chemical, physical, and biological parameters, the drivers of carbon concentrations may differ from larger lakes. For instance, high carbon loading, shallow waters, and frequent mixing could lead to different mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 production in small ponds compared to larger lakes. Furthermore, small pond carbon dynamics may be more sensitive than larger lakes to seasonal and annual variation, such as temperature changes and water availability. Carbon cycling provides valuable knowledge on pond and lake biology, which is important considering the vast majority of the world's ponds and lakes are very small. Additionally, understanding the drivers and concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small ponds will inform local, regional, and global carbon budgets.\n",
      "This study examines the carbon dynamics of six very small (\\0.001 km 2 ), temporary ponds in Connecticut, USA across the open water season and across two years. The goals of the study were (1) to quantify the concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small, temporary, and temperate ponds and (2) to identify the local drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Methods\n",
      "## Study sites and sampling\n",
      "I sampled six temporary ponds in 2013 and five of the six in 2014 (Long Pond was removed from study in 2014 for a whole-ecosystem experiment) (Table 2). The study ponds are located within the Yale Myers Forest, a 3,213-ha research forest in Tolland and Windham Counties, Connecticut, USA. The ponds are located in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with minimal human disturbance. The forest composition surrounding the six ponds is primarily oak (Quercus rubra, Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and pine (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus). The soil types are Charlton-Chatfield Complex (Blacksmith, E8, Quarry, Woodpile Ponds) and Hinckley gravelly sandy loam (Long, Atwood Ponds), with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 %, except for E8 Pond where surrounding slopes range from 15 to 45 % (U.S. Department of Agriculture NRCS 1996). Temporary ponds like these are abundant throughout northern and eastern North America, with one to thirteen ponds per km 2 of undeveloped forest (Brooks et al. 1998;Capps et al. 2014;Palik et al. 2003;Wu et al. 2014). In this region, ponds typically fill with autumnal rains, freeze over the winter, thaw in early spring, and dry by late summer or early fall, although hydroperiod is sensitive to precipitation events. Five of the six study ponds dried in 2013 (all but Woodpile Pond) and all ponds dried in 2014. All six ponds are shallow (\\1 m), lack inlets and outlets, and have little emergent vegetation.\n",
      "I sampled ponds for CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations biweekly from after ice-out in April until the ponds began to dry mid-to late-July. Dry date differed by ponds and among years, allowing up to 9 sampling rounds for each pond in 2013 and up to eight sampling rounds in 2014. In addition to gas concentrations, I measured depth, water temperature, percent dissolved oxygen (DO) (ProODO, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA), pH, and conductivity (Waterproof Multiparameter PCS Testr 35, Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA) biweekly. I also took biweekly samples for chlorophyll a from periphyton growing attached to glass slides (Periphyton Sampler, Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) and from surface water for phytoplankton. Once per month I took water samples to measure total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Samples were taken from surface waters near Z max . For gas concentrations, I took two samples at Z max and in all but the smallest pond (Quarry Pond), I took two additional samples at either end of the pond to account for spatial variability.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Gas concentrations\n",
      "Water samples were collected from 5 to 10 cm below the surface of the water using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex E/S Portable Sampler, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). I collected water in glass BOD bottles, flushed at least twice by their volume while ensuring that no bubbles were produced. I then extracted 110 mL of water using a 140-mL plastic syringe with a three-way stopcock, also being careful to not produce bubbles. I immediately added 30 mL of N 2 , and shook the syringe vigorously for two 2 min to ensure gas equilibrium. I then extracted 15 mL of headspace and stored it in a 12-mL evacuated vial (839 W Exetainer, Labco Limited, Lampeter, UK) until analysis.\n",
      "Headspace concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 were measured by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector fit with a methanizer (Shimadzu GC2014, Kyoto, Japan) and calculated using standard curves. Concentrations of gases dissolved in water were corrected for dilution and calculated according to Henry's law using values for CO 2 from Weiss (1974) and for CH 4 from Wiesenburg and Guinasso (1979).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Water chemistry\n",
      "Glass slides for periphyton chlorophyll a were scraped, rinsed with water, and the resulting periphyton-water slurry was filtered onto pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and frozen until analysis. Water samples for phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and DOC were pre-filtered through 150 lm mesh to remove zooplankton and debris. Water samples for phytoplankton chlorophyll a were then filtered onto pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and frozen until analysis. Periphyton and phytoplankton chlorophyll a was measured from the filters using a fluorometer (TD-700 Fluorometer, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, California, USA) following Environmental Protection Agency Method 445.0. Water samples for TDN, TDP, and DOC were filtered through pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and the filtrate was frozen until analysis. Concentrations of TDN and TDP were determined using a persulfate digestion and colorimetric standard methods (Clesceri et al. 1998) in conjunction with an auto-analyzer (Astoria2 Analyzer, Astoria-Pacific, Clackamas, Oregon, USA). Dissolved organic carbon was analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC 5000 autoanalyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan).\n",
      "\n",
      "## Statistical analysis\n",
      "For overall CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations, the two to four replicate samples were averaged for each pond at each sampling round. These biweekly measurements were used to estimate overall means for each gas (n = 89). To evaluate the saturation of each gas relative to the atmosphere, I used the average of monthly air concentrations from April through July for each year from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, USA. The mean CO 2 air concentrations were 398.5 and 400.9 ppm and the mean CH 4 air concentrations were 1.824 and 1.837 ppm for 2013 and 2014, respectively. I then calculated relative saturation between the water and air for both gases in each pond for every sampling date.\n",
      "To determine which environmental variables predicted gas concentrations, I created linear mixed- Zmax is depth at the deepest point in the pond effects models with pond as a random effect in R (R Version 3.1.2, R Core Team) using the ''lme4'' package (Bates et al. 2014). I evaluated the randomeffects structure by comparing random intercepts for pond, random intercepts for pond with a correlated random slope for time, and random intercepts for pond with an uncorrelated random slope for time. The random intercept for pond was selected because it was most parsimonious and did not differ from the other models. Sampling year was not important in any model and was excluded. Models were constructed using monthly estimates of gas concentrations and environmental variables because TDN, TDP, and DOC were only measured monthly (n = 40). The environmental variables included: temperature, depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and precipitation. Precipitation data was taken from a weather station in Willimantic, Connecticut, USA, about 24 km southwest of the study sites. The precipitation variable is the cumulative amount of precipitation occurring over 2 weeks prior to the sampling date. All environmental variables as well as response variables (CO 2 and CH 4 ) were evaluated for normality and the following variables were natural-log-transformed: CO 2 , CH 4 , DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and precipitation.\n",
      "Models for CO 2 and CH 4 were first fit with all environmental variables and assessed for collinearity by calculating the variation inflation factor (VIF) and removing variables with a VIF C 5. The variables removed included: TDN, TDP, and temperature. As TDN and TDP are highly correlated with DOC (Table 3) and can be considered proxies for DOC in lentic systems with high terrestrial inputs (Larsen et al. 2011), its removal should not mar model interpretation. Temperature and periphyton chlorophyll a are highly correlated (Table 3), meaning that if periphyton chlorophyll a is included in top models, it could also be interpreted as a possible temperature effect. Models were then fit with all remaining environmental variables (depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and precipitation). I built models by selectively removing one variable at a time using AICc model selection (Burnham and Anderson 2002). Once the top predictors were identified, I built the models back up adding in one variable at a time to ensure that I\n",

      "The six temporary ponds exhibited high seasonal variability in physical, chemical, and biological parameters (Table 2). There were seasonal increases in temperature (linear regression, F 1,38 = 145.2, p \\ 0.001, R 2 = 0.79), periphyton chlorophyll a (F 1,38 = 31.3, p \\ 0.001, R 2 = 0.44), TDN (F 1,38 = 9.2, p = 0.004, R 2 = 0.17), and TDP (F 1,38 = 14.7, p \\ 0.001, R 2 = 0.26), and a seasonal decrease in DO (F 1,38 = 20.5, p \\ 0.001, R 2 = 0.33). Notably, temperature ranged from 7.1 to 22.2 °C and trophic status ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic within individual ponds (e.g. phytoplankton chlorophyll a range 0.2-65.1 lg L -1 in Atwood; TDP range 11.4-183.2 lg L -1 in Blacksmith). Dissolved oxygen was undersaturated at all sampling points, ranging from 3.0 to 74.7 %, indicating the ponds were net heterotrophic. There was also substantial between-pond variability (Table 2), with all of the environmental variables differing among ponds (ANOVA, p \\ 0.01) except for DO and temperature. Notably, DOC varied dramatically among ponds with maximum values ranging from 4.9 mg L -1 (Quarry Pond) to 38.4 mg L -1 (Blacksmith Pond).\n",

Across all ponds and all dates, 75 % of samples were[13-fold saturated and 25 % of samples were [22-fold saturated. The concentrations of CO 2 did not differ with time (linear regression, F 1,87 = 0.24, p = 0.62, R 2 = 0.009), but concentrations did vary by pond (ANOVA, F 5,83 = 12.52, p \\ 0.001) with Blacksmith Pond having significantly higher CO 2 concentrations than all other ponds (Tukey HSD, all p \\ 0.05), with all other ponds having similar concentrations (Tukey HSD, all p [ 0.05).\n",

Across all ponds and dates, 75 % of samples were [105-fold saturated and 25 % of samples were[755-fold saturated. Methane concentrations had a weak, but significant, positive relationship with time (F 1,87 = 5.40, p = 0.02, R 2 = 0.05) and were similar across all six ponds (ANOVA, F 5,83 = 1.83 p = 0.12). Error bars represent standard error. For reference, the water-air equilibrium was on average 18.99 (±0.29 SE) lmol L -1 for CO 2 and 0.0727 (±0.0008 SE) lmol L -1 for CH 4 across both years Environmental predictors of CO 2 Concentrations of CO 2 negatively correlated with depth and DO, and positively correlated with DOC and TDP (Table 3). In the mixed-effects models, DO best predicted CO 2 concentrations, with phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH being of secondary importance (Table 4). In the top model, DO explained 23 % of the variance, while between-pond variation explained an additional 37 %, highlighting the importance of variation among individual ponds.\n",
      "To evaluate the relationship between CO 2 and DO further, I compared CO 2 oversaturation with oxygen (O 2 ) undersaturation using all seasonal data points where CO 2 and O 2 were both measured (n = 78) (Fig. 2). There was a significant positive relationship (linear regression, F 1,76 = 13.98, p \\ 0.001, R 2 = 0.14), but this relationship began to break down as DO undersaturation increased. In other words, CO 2 saturation was more variable when DO was lower. Furthermore, the majority of the points fell above the one-to-one CO 2 :O 2 ratio expected if CO 2 were only produced by aerobic respiration, indicating substantial anaerobic production of CO 2 .\n",

In the top model, precipitation explained 34 % of the variance, while between-pond variation only explained an additional 3 %.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Discussion\n",
      "CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations\n",
      "The concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in these small temporary ponds are among the most supersaturated for lentic waters globally. Cole et al. (1994) compared CO 2 concentrations among 1,835 lakes and found that the lower and upper 10 % of samples averaged 3.1fold below and 16-fold above atmospheric equilibrium, respectively (range -175 to 57). In direct comparison, the lower and upper 10 % of samples in this study were 11.2 and 28.6-fold supersaturated.\n",
      "Until now, the highest reported CO 2 concentrations came from a study on 64 small (0.0002-0.2 km 2 ), forested ponds in Denmark, where 75 % of the samples were more than 6-fold saturated and 25 % were more than 16-fold saturated (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). High CO 2 concentrations on the order of magnitude reported here have also been seen on the extreme ends of studies evaluating CO 2 in small wetland ponds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (Hamilton et al. 1994) and lakes in New England (Lennon et al. 2006) and Finland (Kankaala et al. 2013). The temporary ponds studied here had CO 2 concentrations that were consistently some of the highest reported to date, suggesting the conditions in these ponds are prime for CO 2 production.\n",
      "There have been fewer studies on CH 4 than CO 2 concentrations in ponds and lakes globally, but comparisons of available data indicate that the CH 4 concentrations in these study ponds were also among the highest reported. The range of CH 4 concentrations reported for ponds and lakes is substantial, with concentrations as low as 0.004 lmol L -1 in an Irish lake (Whitfield et al. 2011) up to 17.93 lmol L -1 in a Hudson Bay Lowland pond (Hamilton et al. 1994). The small wetland ponds found in the Hudson Bay Lowlands have, until now, had the highest reported concentrations of CH 4 : 75 % of ponds were over 38-fold saturated and 25 % of ponds were over 110-fold saturated (Hamilton et al. 1994). Collectively, the CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations reported in this Carbon dioxide concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with DO, with phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH of secondary importance. In many lakes, however, CO 2 concentrations are best predicted by a negative relationship with DOC (or TOC) (Hope et al. 1996;Jonsson et al. 2003;Kelly et al. 2001;Raymond et al. 2013;Roehm et al. 2009;Sobek et al. 2005). This is because for many lakes, allochthonous organic carbon is the largest source of CO 2 production (Karlsson 2007;McCallister and del Giorgio 2008). A closer inspection, however, shows most studies that reported DOC as predicting CO 2 did not evaluate the relationship between CO 2 and DO (but see Roehm et al. 2009).\n",
      "When DO is considered, many studies found a significant negative correlation between CO 2 and DO (Balmer and Downing 2011;Cole et al. 2010;Kankaala et al. 2013;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roulet et al. 1997;Zhang et al. 2013). A few studies even found DO to be a better predictor of CO 2 concentrations compared to DOC (Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005).\n",
      "Whether DOC or DO better predicts CO 2 concentrations likely depends on the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of ponds and lakes. A high correlation between O 2 and CO 2 indicates substantial respiration, oftentimes from the sediments (Jonsson et al. 2003;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roulet et al. 1997). The relationship between O 2 and CO 2 can be stronger in ponds and lakes with high DOC, likely because of high sedimentation of allochthonous carbon (Jonsson et al. 2003). The ponds studied here are strongly influenced by allochthonous carbon because they are small, with a high perimeter to edge ratio. Each year, the ponds receive between 188 and 253 g m -2 year -1 of dry leaf litter (Holgerson, unpubl. data), providing an annually-renewed source of POC and DOC (Meyer et al. 1998). Because the ponds are shallow, much of the water is in contact with the sediments where the terrestrial carbon decomposes. Furthermore, sediment respiration can affect the entire water column due to overnight mixing that occurs on the scale of days to weeks (Holgerson, unpubl. data).\n",
      "The large amount of terrestrial carbon settling at the bottom of the pond is likely responsible for high respiration rates, driving O 2 levels down and CO 2 concentrations up. Substantial anaerobic respiration also occurred in the ponds (Fig. 2), supporting the notion that sediment respiration could explain both O 2 and CO 2 concentrations. The importance of sediment respiration in driving CO 2 in small ponds is in contrast to water column DOC driving CO 2 in larger ponds and lakes. This is likely because in larger lakes, allochthonous inputs and the contribution of sediments are lower relative to water volume, and the water column stratifies isolating the effects of the sediments to the hypolimnion. The different conditions between small ponds and larger lakes likely explain why the drivers of surface water CO 2 differ with lake size.\n",
      "The second and third top models for predicting CO 2 concentration included phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH, respectively, as covariates of secondary importance to DO. The estimates for both phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH overlapped with zero, illustrating that these variables are not individually important but do strengthen the relationship between DO and CO 2 . Phytoplankton chlorophyll a negatively correlated with CO 2 , which is intuitive, as increased primary production consumes more CO 2 . Other studies have also seen a negative relationship between CO 2 and phytoplankton (Balmer and Downing 2011;Kosten et al. 2010;Larsen et al. 2011;Roehm et al. 2009), highlighting that CO 2 is affected by production in addition to respiration. The third top model included DO and pH, which also negatively correlated with CO 2 . This relationship is most likely driven by increased CO 2 concentrations driving down pH (Wetzel 2001).\n",
      "The random effect of pond significantly improved models of CO 2 concentration and increased the best model's R 2 value from 0.23 to 0.60 (Table 4), indicating substantial between-pond variation. Blacksmith Pond had the highest CO 2 concentrations while Long and Woodpile Ponds had the lowest. Perhaps geology, groundwater inputs, turbulent differences, or another environmental variable not measured here played a role in between-pond differences. It is worth noting that while groundwater can be an important source of CO 2 in some freshwater systems (Humborg et al. 2010), there are several indications that groundwater is unlikely to play a major role in these ponds. First, the strong correlation between precipitation and depth (Table 3, r = 0.50) along with low conductivity (\\82 lS/cm) indicate that these ponds are fed by precipitation and not groundwater (Brooks 2004(Brooks , 2005;;Palik et al. 2001;Yoshikawa and Hinzman 2003). Additionally, there were no spikes in conductivity as the ponds dried, indicating that more water was lost to seepage than to evaporation and that the ponds recharged groundwater rather than drawing from it (Schneider and Frost 1996). As such, groundwater likely provides minimal CO 2 inputs to these temporary ponds, but there could be variation among sites.\n",
      "Year and sampling round had no significant effect on CO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 concentrations in these ponds were similar inter-and intra-annually. Jonsson et al. (2003) also found no seasonal effect on CO 2 concentrations across 16 Swedish lakes, hypothesizing that there was little metabolic change and that frequent mixing minimized seasonal changes in CO 2 concentrations. In the ponds studied here, metabolic activity likely increased with temperature as exhibited by seasonal increases in periphyton chlorophyll a. I hypothesize that CO 2 concentrations remained steady due to both polymictic mixing and high sediment respiration throughout the season. It is also possible that anaerobic breakdown of DOC and POC shifted more toward methanogenesis seasonally, which could reduce sediment CO 2 production and mask any seasonal increases in CO 2 that would occur if O 2 were more available.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Environmental predictors of CH 4\n",
      "The strongest predictor of CH 4 concentrations in these temporary ponds was precipitation, with periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth being of secondary importance. Increased precipitation was associated with decreased CH 4 concentrations, a contrast with other studies where precipitation increased with CH 4 (Natchimuthu et al. 2014) and CO 2 (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roehm et al. 2009) concentrations or flux. In those studies, increased precipitation was associated with increased DOC in lakes likely due to increased runoff from the landscape (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005). In this study, however, precipitation negatively correlated with DOC (Table 3, r = -0.45). Precipitation events likely influence small ponds differently than larger lakes because of their particular characteristics. Specifically, the volume of these small and shallow ponds responded dramatically to precipitation events. For instance, 21.7 cm of rainfall occurred during the first 2 weeks of June 2013 and as a result, pond depth increased by an average of 23.5 (±7.7 SE) cm (range 5-50 cm). Most ponds (five of the six) are located in defined basins, which prohibited areal expansion and led to dramatic increases in depth. For instance, Quarry and Long Ponds more than doubled in depth whereas Blacksmith Pond, the only pond able to significantly expand in area, only increased by 5 cm in depth.\n",
      "As precipitation dramatically increased depth but not area in five of the six ponds, the relative depth (depth to surface area ratio) increased, causing a dilution effect for many of the pond's biological and chemical parameters. Specifically, increased precipitation correlated with decreased DOC, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDP, TDN, and temperature, and increased DO (Table 3). Many of these effects could alter CH 4 production and concentrations. For instance, DO is negatively correlated with CH 4 concentrations as anoxic sediments or waters are required for methanogenesis (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Methane concentrations are also affected by lake area and depth: small and shallow lakes have more water in contact with anoxic sediments, less opportunity for methane oxidation between the sediments and surface water, and a well-mixed water column that permits benthic CH 4 to reach the surface (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Increased temperature also correlates with greater CH 4 concentrations as methanogenesis increases with temperature (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Interestingly, precipitation led to lower DOC in these ponds, implying an internal source of DOC (e.g. through leaf litter breakdown) that builds up between precipitation events and overmatches any DOC inputs from runoff. Overall, precipitation events dilute the biological and chemical parameters in small ponds, ultimately lowering CH 4 concentrations. In addition to dilution, precipitation also increases gas exchange rates (Ho et al. 1997(Ho et al. , 2000)), allowing O 2 to enter ponds and increasing efflux of CO 2 and CO 2 . The observed negative relationship between CH 4 concentrations and precipitation was therefore likely a result of both dilution and increased gas exchange.\n",
      "Models predicting CH 4 concentrations also suggest that periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth were of secondary importance. Periphyton chlorophyll a was not significantly correlated with CH 4 , but did correlate highly with temperature, which was removed from models due to collinearity. As temperature correlated strongly with CH 4 , it is possible that periphyton is acting as a surrogate for temperature in the model, a plausible link as temperature increases methane production (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Phytoplankton chlorophyll a also positively correlated with CH 4 concentration, likely because phytoplankton biomass increased with temperature and decreased with precipitation. Additionally, algal biomass is very labile and could provide another source of organic matter for decomposition. Lastly, depth improved model predictions, but its estimate included zero. It is likely that the model derived strength from the correlation between depth and precipitation.\n",
      "There was little between-pond variation in CH 4 concentrations and as such, the random effect of pond only increased the best model R 2 from 0.34 to 0.37 (Table 5). It is worth considering why between-pond variation was important for CO 2 and not for CH 4 . Methane concentrations were likely driven by precipitation, which was similar across all ponds (and imputed as the same number in models). In contrast, CO 2 concentrations were likely driven by sediment respiration, which was more variable among dates and ponds. Random effects of year and sampling round did also not improve CH 4 models, indicating that concentrations were similar between years and season, with major changes driven by precipitation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Small ponds and inland water carbon budgets\n",
      "It is well known that small ponds are more saturated with CO 2 and CH 4 than larger lakes (Bastviken et al. 2004;Kankaala et al. 2013;Raymond et al. 2013); however, this study shows that these very small ponds (\\1000 m 2 ) are among the most saturated reported. Using a gas exchange velocity k 600 of 0.36 m day -1 calculated from a propane-addition study in four similar ponds in the study area (E. Farr, unpubl. data), these ponds emit on average 100.6 (±0.51 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CO 2 and 10.6 (±0.13 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CH 4 . In terms of carbon dioxide equivalence (CO 2 e), the contribution of CH 4 (4.26 g CO 2 e m -2 day -1 ) is comparable to the contribution from CO 2 (4.43 g CO 2 m -2 day -1 ), indicating a similar greenhouse gas potential. It is important to note that this flux estimate does not include CH 4 ebullition, which can be significant in shallow and nutrient-rich ponds and lakes (Bastviken et al. 2004;Casper et al. 2000;Huttunen et al. 2003). Convective mixing could also increase gas exchange at night (Eugster et al. 2003;MacIntyre et al. 2010); however, diurnal patterns of gas exchange in very small ponds need further study.\n",
      "These fluxes are among the highest reported for ponds and lakes globally, indicating that supersaturation compensates for a lower gas transfer velocity. Despite the high concentrations and fluxes of carbon from ponds small in surface area, ponds \\1000 m 2 are excluded from global carbon budgets because they cannot be easily identified from satellite imagery, calling into question both the total number and total surface area of small ponds. Local and regional estimates of small, temporary ponds are limited, but suggest that small, temporary ponds are abundant. Capps et al. (2014) report that Orono, Maine, USA, a town of 50.76 km 2 , has 0.09 km 2 of temporary ponds (*0.002 % surface area). A study using highresolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to map temporary ponds across 147.9 km 2 in southeastern Massachusetts, USA, identified 2,228 potential ponds comprising 3.8 km 2 of surface area (*2.59 % surface area) (Wu et al. 2014). There is an urgent need for future studies utilizing advancing technologies, such as LiDAR, to map the distribution of very small ponds.\n",
      "Because small ponds are numerous with extremely high CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations, they could play an important yet overlooked role in local, regional, and global carbon budgets. Specifically, small ponds respire significant amounts of terrestrial carbon that if unaccounted for, could overestimate terrestrial net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In regional carbon budgets, the exclusion of surface waters can overestimate terrestrial NEP by 6-44 % (Buffam et al. 2011;Christensen et al. 2007;Jonsson et al. 2007). On a global scale, unaccounted respiration from very small ponds could overestimate the terrestrial carbon sink, as has been suggested for other inland waters (Bastviken et al. 2011;Battin et al. 2009;Raymond et al. 2013).\n",

       "['# Drivers of carbon dioxide and methane supersaturation in small, temporary ponds\\n## Abstract\\nInland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle, but there is a poor understanding of carbon dynamics in very small ponds. In this study, I evaluated the concentrations and drivers of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) in six small (\\\\1000 m 2 ), temporary, forested ponds in Connecticut, USA. The six ponds were on average 19-fold supersaturated in CO 2 and 504-fold supersaturated in CH 4 relative to the atmosphere. For both gases, this level of supersaturation is among the highest reported for lentic freshwaters. The physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the ponds differ from larger lakes, and may explain the supersaturation. Specifically, the ponds have high terrestrial carbon loadings, are shallow, and polymictic, meaning much of the water is in contact with the carbon-rich sediments. Pond CO 2 concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that substantial respiration, likely from the sediments, drew down oxygen (O 2 ) and produced CO 2 . The stoichiometric relationship between CO 2 supersaturation and O 2 undersaturation also implicates anaerobic respiration as a significant source of CO 2 production in the ponds. The high carbon, low oxygen, and shallow nature of small ponds were also prime for CH 4 supersaturation. Methane concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with precipitation, likely because precipitation increased pond depth, diluted dissolved organic carbon and gas concentrations, and increased DO. If the respiration of terrestrial carbon in small ponds is not accounted for in carbon budgets, current estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may be overestimated.',\n",
       " \"## Introduction\\nInland waters play an important role in the global carbon cycle. While estimated to comprise only 2.2-3.7 % of the earth's non-glaciated land area (Raymond et al. 2013;Verpoorter et al. 2014), inland waters process the same amount of carbon as both net terrestrial productivity and net oceanic uptake (Aufdenkampe et al. 2011;Battin et al. 2009). Yet, estimates of global carbon flux from inland waters are ridden with uncertainty (Raymond et al. 2013) and finer-scale studies are needed to determine carbon concentrations in global waters (Battin et al. 2009).One source of uncertainty in global carbon budgets is the role of small ponds. The majority of studies on carbon cycling in lentic systems have focused on medium-to large-sized lakes. Yet the vast majority of ponds and lakes are small: over 90 % of all ponds and lakes are\\\\0.01 km 2 (Downing et al. 2006;Verpoorter et al. 2014), not including very small ponds (0.0001-0.001 km 2 ) which could number as high as 3.2 billion and cover 0.8 million km 2 of surface area (Downing 2010). However, small ponds\\\\0.1 km 2 are difficult to map (Lehner and Do ¨ll 2004) and even highresolution satellite images cannot accurately identify ponds\\\\0.002 km 2 (Verpoorter et al. 2014). Due to the uncertainty of their distribution, very small ponds (\\\\0.001 km 2 ) remain difficult to assess in regional and global biogeochemical models, and are excluded.\",\n",
       " 'Regardless of their areal extent, small ponds may be hotspots for carbon cycling. Small and shallow ponds receive high loadings of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) relative to their water volume, which increases respiration and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production (Hope et al. 1996;Kelly et al. 2001;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rubbo et al. 2006). Methane (CH 4 ) concentrations also tend to be greater in small ponds because more water is in contact with anoxic sediments and shallow waters reduce the amount of CH 4 oxidation that occurs between the sediments and surface waters (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). As CH 4 has a global warming potential about 25 times higher than CO 2 , its contribution to carbon budgets should not be overlooked (Bastviken et al. 2011).Although small, shallow ponds are abundant and may be highly saturated with carbon gases, few studies have evaluated the concentrations, fluxes, and drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 in very small ponds. The studies that have done so indicate that small ponds (B0.01 km 2 ) have some of the highest CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in both boreal and temperate regions (Table 1). Due to their high concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 , is possible that carbon flux from small ponds \\\\0.01 km 2 may match that of larger lakes on both a local (Abnizova et al. 2012) and a global (Torgersen and Branco 2008) scale.',\n",
       " \"Yet the paucity of studies on carbon dynamics in small ponds, particularly in temperate regions, limits our understanding of inland water carbon cycling. It is imperative to know both the concentrations and mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturation in small freshwaters. As very small ponds have unique chemical, physical, and biological parameters, the drivers of carbon concentrations may differ from larger lakes. For instance, high carbon loading, shallow waters, and frequent mixing could lead to different mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 production in small ponds compared to larger lakes. Furthermore, small pond carbon dynamics may be more sensitive than larger lakes to seasonal and annual variation, such as temperature changes and water availability. Carbon cycling provides valuable knowledge on pond and lake biology, which is important considering the vast majority of the world's ponds and lakes are very small. Additionally, understanding the drivers and concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small ponds will inform local, regional, and global carbon budgets.This study examines the carbon dynamics of six very small (\\\\0.001 km 2 ), temporary ponds in Connecticut, USA across the open water season and across two years. The goals of the study were (1) to quantify the concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small, temporary, and temperate ponds and (2) to identify the local drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations.\",\n",
       " '## Methods\\n## Study sites and sampling\\nI sampled six temporary ponds in 2013 and five of the six in 2014 (Long Pond was removed from study in 2014 for a whole-ecosystem experiment) (Table 2). The study ponds are located within the Yale Myers Forest, a 3,213-ha research forest in Tolland and Windham Counties, Connecticut, USA. The ponds are located in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with minimal human disturbance. The forest composition surrounding the six ponds is primarily oak (Quercus rubra, Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and pine (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus). The soil types are Charlton-Chatfield Complex (Blacksmith, E8, Quarry, Woodpile Ponds) and Hinckley gravelly sandy loam (Long, Atwood Ponds), with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 %, except for E8 Pond where surrounding slopes range from 15 to 45 % (U.S. Department of Agriculture NRCS 1996). Temporary ponds like these are abundant throughout northern and eastern North America, with one to thirteen ponds per km 2 of undeveloped forest (Brooks et al. 1998;Capps et al. 2014;Palik et al. 2003;Wu et al. 2014). In this region, ponds typically fill with autumnal rains, freeze over the winter, thaw in early spring, and dry by late summer or early fall, although hydroperiod is sensitive to precipitation events. Five of the six study ponds dried in 2013 (all but Woodpile Pond) and all ponds dried in 2014. All six ponds are shallow (\\\\1 m), lack inlets and outlets, and have little emergent vegetation.',\n",
       " 'I sampled ponds for CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations biweekly from after ice-out in April until the ponds began to dry mid-to late-July. Dry date differed by ponds and among years, allowing up to 9 sampling rounds for each pond in 2013 and up to eight sampling rounds in 2014. In addition to gas concentrations, I measured depth, water temperature, percent dissolved oxygen (DO) (ProODO, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA), pH, and conductivity (Waterproof Multiparameter PCS Testr 35, Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA) biweekly. I also took biweekly samples for chlorophyll a from periphyton growing attached to glass slides (Periphyton Sampler, Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) and from surface water for phytoplankton.

I then extracted 110 mL of water using a 140-mL plastic syringe with a three-way stopcock, also being careful to not produce bubbles. I immediately added 30 mL of N 2 , and shook the syringe vigorously for two 2 min to ensure gas equilibrium.

       " \"## Statistical analysis\\nFor overall CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations, the two to four replicate samples were averaged for each pond at each sampling round. These biweekly measurements were used to estimate overall means for each gas (n = 89). To evaluate the saturation of each gas relative to the atmosphere, I used the average of monthly air concentrations from April through July for each year from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, USA. The mean CO 2 air concentrations were 398.5 and 400.9 ppm and the mean CH 4 air concentrations were 1.824 and 1.837 ppm for 2013 and 2014, respectively. I then calculated relative saturation between the water and air for both gases in each pond for every sampling date.To determine which environmental variables predicted gas concentrations, I created linear mixed- Zmax is depth at the deepest point in the pond effects models with pond as a random effect in R (R Version 3.1.2, R Core Team) using the ''lme4'' package (Bates et al. 2014). I evaluated the randomeffects structure by comparing random intercepts for pond, random intercepts for pond with a correlated random slope for time, and random intercepts for pond with an uncorrelated random slope for time. The random intercept for pond was selected because it was most parsimonious and did not differ from the other models. Sampling year was not important in any model and was excluded. Models were constructed using monthly estimates of gas concentrations and environmental variables because TDN, TDP, and DOC were only measured monthly (n = 40). The environmental variables included: temperature, depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and precipitation. Precipitation data was taken from a weather station in Willimantic, Connecticut, USA, about 24 km southwest of the study sites. The precipitation variable is the cumulative amount of precipitation occurring over 2 weeks prior to the sampling date. All environmental variables as well as response variables (CO 2 and CH 4 ) were evaluated for normality and the following variables were natural-log-transformed: CO 2 , CH 4 , DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and precipitation.\",\n",

Temperature and periphyton chlorophyll a are highly correlated (Table 3), meaning that if periphyton chlorophyll a is included in top models, it could also be interpreted as a possible temperature effect. Models were then fit with all remaining environmental variables (depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and precipitation).

       " '## Discussion\\nCO 2 and CH 4 concentrations\\nThe concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in these small temporary ponds are among the most supersaturated for lentic waters globally. Cole et al. (1994) compared CO 2 concentrations among 1,835 lakes and found that the lower and upper 10 % of samples averaged 3.1fold below and 16-fold above atmospheric equilibrium, respectively (range -175 to 57). In direct comparison, the lower and upper 10 % of samples in this study were 11.2 and 28.6-fold supersaturated.Until now, the highest reported CO 2 concentrations came from a study on 64 small (0.0002-0.2 km 2 ), forested ponds in Denmark, where 75 % of the samples were more than 6-fold saturated and 25 % were more than 16-fold saturated (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). High CO 2 concentrations on the order of magnitude reported here have also been seen on the extreme ends of studies evaluating CO 2 in small wetland ponds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands (Hamilton et al. 1994) and lakes in New England (Lennon et al. 2006) and Finland (Kankaala et al. 2013). The temporary ponds studied here had CO 2 concentrations that were consistently some of the highest reported to date, suggesting the conditions in these ponds are prime for CO 2 production.',\n",
       " 'There have been fewer studies on CH 4 than CO 2 concentrations in ponds and lakes globally, but comparisons of available data indicate that the CH 4 concentrations in these study ponds were also among the highest reported. The range of CH 4 concentrations reported for ponds and lakes is substantial, with concentrations as low as 0.004 lmol L -1 in an Irish lake (Whitfield et al. 2011) up to 17.93 lmol L -1 in a Hudson Bay Lowland pond (Hamilton et al. 1994). The small wetland ponds found in the Hudson Bay Lowlands have, until now, had the highest reported concentrations of CH 4 : 75 % of ponds were over 38-fold saturated and 25 % of ponds were over 110-fold saturated (Hamilton et al. 1994). Collectively, the CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations reported in this Carbon dioxide concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with DO, with phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH of secondary importance. In many lakes, however, CO 2 concentrations are best predicted by a negative relationship with DOC (or TOC) (Hope et al. 1996;Jonsson et al. 2003;Kelly et al. 2001;Raymond et al. 2013;Roehm et al. 2009;Sobek et al. 2005). This is because for many lakes, allochthonous organic carbon is the largest source of CO 2 production (Karlsson 2007;McCallister and del Giorgio 2008). A closer inspection, however, shows most studies that reported DOC as predicting CO 2 did not evaluate the relationship between CO 2 and DO (but see Roehm et al. 2009).',\n",
       " 'When DO is considered, many studies found a significant negative correlation between CO 2 and DO (Balmer and Downing 2011;Cole et al. 2010;Kankaala et al. 2013;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roulet et al. 1997;Zhang et al. 2013). A few studies even found DO to be a better predictor of CO 2 concentrations compared to DOC (Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005).Whether DOC or DO better predicts CO 2 concentrations likely depends on the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of ponds and lakes. A high correlation between O 2 and CO 2 indicates substantial respiration, oftentimes from the sediments (Jonsson et al. 2003;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roulet et al. 1997). The relationship between O 2 and CO 2 can be stronger in ponds and lakes with high DOC, likely because of high sedimentation of allochthonous carbon (Jonsson et al. 2003). The ponds studied here are strongly influenced by allochthonous carbon because they are small, with a high perimeter to edge ratio. Each year, the ponds receive between 188 and 253 g m -2 year -1 of dry leaf litter (Holgerson, unpubl. data), providing an annually-renewed source of POC and DOC (Meyer et al. 1998). Because the ponds are shallow, much of the water is in contact with the sediments where the terrestrial carbon decomposes. Furthermore, sediment respiration can affect the entire water column due to overnight mixing that occurs on the scale of days to weeks (Holgerson, unpubl. data).',\n",
       " 'The large amount of terrestrial carbon settling at the bottom of the pond is likely responsible for high respiration rates, driving O 2 levels down and CO 2 concentrations up. Substantial anaerobic respiration also occurred in the ponds (Fig. 2), supporting the notion that sediment respiration could explain both O 2 and CO 2 concentrations. The importance of sediment respiration in driving CO 2 in small ponds is in contrast to water column DOC driving CO 2 in larger ponds and lakes. This is likely because in larger lakes, allochthonous inputs and the contribution of sediments are lower relative to water volume, and the water column stratifies isolating the effects of the sediments to the hypolimnion. The different conditions between small ponds and larger lakes likely explain why the drivers of surface water CO 2 differ with lake size.The second and third top models for predicting CO 2 concentration included phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH, respectively, as covariates of secondary importance to DO. The estimates for both phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH overlapped with zero, illustrating that these variables are not individually important but do strengthen the relationship between DO and CO 2 . Phytoplankton chlorophyll a negatively correlated with CO 2 , which is intuitive, as increased primary production consumes more CO 2 . Other studies have also seen a negative relationship between CO 2 and phytoplankton (Balmer and Downing 2011;Kosten et al. 2010;Larsen et al. 2011;Roehm et al. 2009), highlighting that CO 2 is affected by production in addition to respiration. The third top model included DO and pH, which also negatively correlated with CO 2 . This relationship is most likely driven by increased CO 2 concentrations driving down pH (Wetzel 2001).',\n",
       " \"The random effect of pond significantly improved models of CO 2 concentration and increased the best model's R 2 value from 0.23 to 0.60 (Table 4), indicating substantial between-pond variation. Blacksmith Pond had the highest CO 2 concentrations while Long and Woodpile Ponds had the lowest. Perhaps geology, groundwater inputs, turbulent differences, or another environmental variable not measured here played a role in between-pond differences. It is worth noting that while groundwater can be an important source of CO 2 in some freshwater systems (Humborg et al. 2010), there are several indications that groundwater is unlikely to play a major role in these ponds. First, the strong correlation between precipitation and depth (Table 3, r = 0.50) along with low conductivity (\\\\82 lS/cm) indicate that these ponds are fed by precipitation and not groundwater (Brooks 2004(Brooks , 2005;;Palik et al. 2001;Yoshikawa and Hinzman 2003). Additionally, there were no spikes in conductivity as the ponds dried, indicating that more water was lost to seepage than to evaporation and that the ponds recharged groundwater rather than drawing from it (Schneider and Frost 1996). As such, groundwater likely provides minimal CO 2 inputs to these temporary ponds, but there could be variation among sites.Year and sampling round had no significant effect on CO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 concentrations in these ponds were similar inter-and intra-annually. Jonsson et al. (2003) also found no seasonal effect on CO 2 concentrations across 16 Swedish lakes, hypothesizing that there was little metabolic change and that frequent mixing minimized seasonal changes in CO 2 concentrations. In the ponds studied here, metabolic activity likely increased with temperature as exhibited by seasonal increases in periphyton chlorophyll a. I hypothesize that CO 2 concentrations remained steady due to both polymictic mixing and high sediment respiration throughout the season. It is also possible that anaerobic breakdown of DOC and POC shifted more toward methanogenesis seasonally, which could reduce sediment CO 2 production and mask any seasonal increases in CO 2 that would occur if O 2 were more available.\",\n",
       " '## Environmental predictors of CH 4\\nThe strongest predictor of CH 4 concentrations in these temporary ponds was precipitation, with periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth being of secondary importance. Increased precipitation was associated with decreased CH 4 concentrations, a contrast with other studies where precipitation increased with CH 4 (Natchimuthu et al. 2014) and CO 2 (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roehm et al. 2009) concentrations or flux. In those studies, increased precipitation was associated with increased DOC in lakes likely due to increased runoff from the landscape (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005). In this study, however, precipitation negatively correlated with DOC (Table 3, r = -0.45). Precipitation events likely influence small ponds differently than larger lakes because of their particular characteristics. Specifically, the volume of these small and shallow ponds responded dramatically to precipitation events. For instance, 21.7 cm of rainfall occurred during the first 2 weeks of June 2013 and as a result, pond depth increased by an average of 23.5 (±7.7 SE) cm (range 5-50 cm). Most ponds (five of the six) are located in defined basins, which prohibited areal expansion and led to dramatic increases in depth. For instance, Quarry and Long Ponds more than doubled in depth whereas Blacksmith Pond, the only pond able to significantly expand in area, only increased by 5 cm in depth.',\n",
       " \"As precipitation dramatically increased depth but not area in five of the six ponds, the relative depth (depth to surface area ratio) increased, causing a dilution effect for many of the pond's biological and chemical parameters. Specifically, increased precipitation correlated with decreased DOC, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDP, TDN, and temperature, and increased DO (Table 3). Many of these effects could alter CH 4 production and concentrations. For instance, DO is negatively correlated with CH 4 concentrations as anoxic sediments or waters are required for methanogenesis (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Methane concentrations are also affected by lake area and depth: small and shallow lakes have more water in contact with anoxic sediments, less opportunity for methane oxidation between the sediments and surface water, and a well-mixed water column that permits benthic CH 4 to reach the surface (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Increased temperature also correlates with greater CH 4 concentrations as methanogenesis increases with temperature (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Interestingly, precipitation led to lower DOC in these ponds, implying an internal source of DOC (e.g. through leaf litter breakdown) that builds up between precipitation events and overmatches any DOC inputs from runoff. Overall, precipitation events dilute the biological and chemical parameters in small ponds, ultimately lowering CH 4 concentrations. In addition to dilution, precipitation also increases gas exchange rates (Ho et al. 1997(Ho et al. , 2000)), allowing O 2 to enter ponds and increasing efflux of CO 2 and CO 2 . The observed negative relationship between CH 4 concentrations and precipitation was therefore likely a result of both dilution and increased gas exchange.\",\n",
       " 'Models predicting CH 4 concentrations also suggest that periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth were of secondary importance. Periphyton chlorophyll a was not significantly correlated with CH 4 , but did correlate highly with temperature, which was removed from models due to collinearity. As temperature correlated strongly with CH 4 , it is possible that periphyton is acting as a surrogate for temperature in the model, a plausible link as temperature increases methane production (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Phytoplankton chlorophyll a also positively correlated with CH 4 concentration, likely because phytoplankton biomass increased with temperature and decreased with precipitation. Additionally, algal biomass is very labile and could provide another source of organic matter for decomposition. Lastly, depth improved model predictions, but its estimate included zero. It is likely that the model derived strength from the correlation between depth and precipitation.There was little between-pond variation in CH 4 concentrations and as such, the random effect of pond only increased the best model R 2 from 0.34 to 0.37 (Table 5). It is worth considering why between-pond variation was important for CO 2 and not for CH 4 . Methane concentrations were likely driven by precipitation, which was similar across all ponds (and imputed as the same number in models). In contrast, CO 2 concentrations were likely driven by sediment respiration, which was more variable among dates and ponds. Random effects of year and sampling round did also not improve CH 4 models, indicating that concentrations were similar between years and season, with major changes driven by precipitation.',\n",
       " '## Small ponds and inland water carbon budgets\\nIt is well known that small ponds are more saturated with CO 2 and CH 4 than larger lakes (Bastviken et al. 2004;Kankaala et al. 2013;Raymond et al. 2013); however, this study shows that these very small ponds (\\\\1000 m 2 ) are among the most saturated reported. Using a gas exchange velocity k 600 of 0.36 m day -1 calculated from a propane-addition study in four similar ponds in the study area (E. Farr, unpubl. data), these ponds emit on average 100.6 (±0.51 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CO 2 and 10.6 (±0.13 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CH 4 . In terms of carbon dioxide equivalence (CO 2 e), the contribution of CH 4 (4.26 g CO 2 e m -2 day -1 ) is comparable to the contribution from CO 2 (4.43 g CO 2 m -2 day -1 ), indicating a similar greenhouse gas potential. It is important to note that this flux estimate does not include CH 4 ebullition, which can be significant in shallow and nutrient-rich ponds and lakes (Bastviken et al. 2004;Casper et al. 2000;Huttunen et al. 2003). Convective mixing could also increase gas exchange at night (Eugster et al. 2003;MacIntyre et al. 2010); however, diurnal patterns of gas exchange in very small ponds need further study.',\n",
       " 'These fluxes are among the highest reported for ponds and lakes globally, indicating that supersaturation compensates for a lower gas transfer velocity. Despite the high concentrations and fluxes of carbon from ponds small in surface area, ponds \\\\1000 m 2 are excluded from global carbon budgets because they cannot be easily identified from satellite imagery, calling into question both the total number and total surface area of small ponds. Local and regional estimates of small, temporary ponds are limited, but suggest that small, temporary ponds are abundant. Capps et al. (2014) report that Orono, Maine, USA, a town of 50.76 km 2 , has 0.09 km 2 of temporary ponds (*0.002 % surface area). A study using highresolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data to map temporary ponds across 147.9 km 2 in southeastern Massachusetts, USA, identified 2,228 potential ponds comprising 3.8 km 2 of surface area (*2.59 % surface area) (Wu et al. 2014). There is an urgent need for future studies utilizing advancing technologies, such as LiDAR, to map the distribution of very small ponds.Because small ponds are numerous with extremely high CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations, they could play an important yet overlooked role in local, regional, and global carbon budgets. Specifically, small ponds respire significant amounts of terrestrial carbon that if unaccounted for, could overestimate terrestrial net ecosystem productivity (NEP). In regional carbon budgets, the exclusion of surface waters can overestimate terrestrial NEP by 6-44 % (Buffam et al. 2011;Christensen et al. 2007;Jonsson et al. 2007). On a global scale, unaccounted respiration from very small ponds could overestimate the terrestrial carbon sink, as has been suggested for other inland waters (Bastviken et al. 2011;Battin et al. 2009;Raymond et al. 2013).',\n",

       " 'Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle, but there is a poor understanding of carbon dynamics in very small ponds. In this study, I evaluated the concentrations and drivers of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) in six small (\\\\1000 m 2 ), temporary, forested ponds in Connecticut, USA. The six ponds were on average 19-fold supersaturated in CO 2 and 504-fold supersaturated in CH 4 relative to the atmosphere. For both gases, this level of supersaturation is among the highest reported for lentic freshwaters. The physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the ponds differ from larger lakes, and may explain the supersaturation. Specifically, the ponds have high terrestrial carbon loadings, are shallow, and polymictic, meaning much of the water is in contact with the carbon-rich sediments',\n",
       " 'Pond CO 2 concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that substantial respiration, likely from the sediments, drew down oxygen (O 2 ) and produced CO 2 . The stoichiometric relationship between CO 2 supersaturation and O 2 undersaturation also implicates anaerobic respiration as a significant source of CO 2 production in the ponds. The high carbon, low oxygen, and shallow nature of small ponds were also prime for CH 4 supersaturation. Methane concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with precipitation, likely because precipitation increased pond depth, diluted dissolved organic carbon and gas concentrations, and increased DO. If the respiration of terrestrial carbon in small ponds is not accounted for in carbon budgets, current estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may be overestimated.',\n",
       " \"## Introduction Inland waters play an important role in the global carbon cycle. While estimated to comprise only 2.2-3.7 % of the earth's non-glaciated land area (Raymond et al. 2013;Verpoorter et al. 2014), inland waters process the same amount of carbon as both net terrestrial productivity and net oceanic uptake (Aufdenkampe et al. 2011;Battin et al. 2009). Yet, estimates of global carbon flux from inland waters are ridden with uncertainty (Raymond et al. 2013) and finer-scale studies are needed to determine carbon concentrations in global waters (Battin et al. 2009).\",\n",
       " 'One source of uncertainty in global carbon budgets is the role of small ponds. The majority of studies on carbon cycling in lentic systems have focused on medium-to large-sized lakes. Yet the vast majority of ponds and lakes are small: over 90 % of all ponds and lakes are\\\\0.01 km 2 (Downing et al. 2006;Verpoorter et al. 2014), not including very small ponds (0.0001-0.001 km 2 ) which could number as high as 3.2 billion and cover 0.8 million km 2 of surface area (Downing 2010). However, small ponds\\\\0.1 km 2 are difficult to map (Lehner and Do ¨ll 2004) and even highresolution satellite images cannot accurately identify ponds\\\\0.002 km 2 (Verpoorter et al. 2014)',\n",
       " 'Due to the uncertainty of their distribution, very small ponds (\\\\0.001 km 2 ) remain difficult to assess in regional and global biogeochemical models, and are excluded.',\n",
       " 'Regardless of their areal extent, small ponds may be hotspots for carbon cycling. Small and shallow ponds receive high loadings of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) relative to their water volume, which increases respiration and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production (Hope et al. 1996;Kelly et al. 2001;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rubbo et al. 2006). Methane (CH 4 ) concentrations also tend to be greater in small ponds because more water is in contact with anoxic sediments and shallow waters reduce the amount of CH 4 oxidation that occurs between the sediments and surface waters (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013)',\n",
       " 'As CH 4 has a global warming potential about 25 times higher than CO 2 , its contribution to carbon budgets should not be overlooked (Bastviken et al. 2011).',\n",
       " 'Although small, shallow ponds are abundant and may be highly saturated with carbon gases, few studies have evaluated the concentrations, fluxes, and drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 in very small ponds. The studies that have done so indicate that small ponds (B0.01 km 2 ) have some of the highest CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in both boreal and temperate regions (Table 1). Due to their high concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 , is possible that carbon flux from small ponds \\\\0.01 km 2 may match that of larger lakes on both a local (Abnizova et al. 2012) and a global (Torgersen and Branco 2008) scale.',\n",
       " \"Yet the paucity of studies on carbon dynamics in small ponds, particularly in temperate regions, limits our understanding of inland water carbon cycling. It is imperative to know both the concentrations and mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturation in small freshwaters. As very small ponds have unique chemical, physical, and biological parameters, the drivers of carbon concentrations may differ from larger lakes. For instance, high carbon loading, shallow waters, and frequent mixing could lead to different mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 production in small ponds compared to larger lakes. Furthermore, small pond carbon dynamics may be more sensitive than larger lakes to seasonal and annual variation, such as temperature changes and water availability. Carbon cycling provides valuable knowledge on pond and lake biology, which is important considering the vast majority of the world's ponds and lakes are very small\",\n",
       " 'Additionally, understanding the drivers and concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small ponds will inform local, regional, and global carbon budgets.',\n",
       " 'This study examines the carbon dynamics of six very small (\\\\0.001 km 2 ), temporary ponds in Connecticut, USA across the open water season and across two years. The goals of the study were (1) to quantify the concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small, temporary, and temperate ponds and (2) to identify the local drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations.',\n",
       " '## Methods ## Study sites and sampling I sampled six temporary ponds in 2013 and five of the six in 2014 (Long Pond was removed from study in 2014 for a whole-ecosystem experiment) (Table 2). The study ponds are located within the Yale Myers Forest, a 3,213-ha research forest in Tolland and Windham Counties, Connecticut, USA. The ponds are located in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with minimal human disturbance. The forest composition surrounding the six ponds is primarily oak (Quercus rubra, Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and pine (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus)',\n",
       " 'The soil types are Charlton-Chatfield Complex (Blacksmith, E8, Quarry, Woodpile Ponds) and Hinckley gravelly sandy loam (Long, Atwood Ponds), with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 %, except for E8 Pond where surrounding slopes range from 15 to 45 % (U.S. Department of Agriculture NRCS 1996). Temporary ponds like these are abundant throughout northern and eastern North America, with one to thirteen ponds per km 2 of undeveloped forest (Brooks et al. 1998;Capps et al. 2014;Palik et al. 2003;Wu et al. 2014). In this region, ponds typically fill with autumnal rains, freeze over the winter, thaw in early spring, and dry by late summer or early fall, although hydroperiod is sensitive to precipitation events',\n",
       " 'Five of the six study ponds dried in 2013 (all but Woodpile Pond) and all ponds dried in 2014. All six ponds are shallow (\\\\1 m), lack inlets and outlets, and have little emergent vegetation.',\n",
       " 'I sampled ponds for CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations biweekly from after ice-out in April until the ponds began to dry mid-to late-July. Dry date differed by ponds and among years, allowing up to 9 sampling rounds for each pond in 2013 and up to eight sampling rounds in 2014. In addition to gas concentrations, I measured depth, water temperature, percent dissolved oxygen (DO) (ProODO, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA), pH, and conductivity (Waterproof Multiparameter PCS Testr 35, Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA) biweekly. I also took biweekly samples for chlorophyll a from periphyton growing attached to glass slides (Periphyton Sampler, Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) and from surface water for phytoplankton',\n",
       " 'Once per month I took water samples to measure total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Samples were taken from surface waters near Z max . For gas concentrations, I took two samples at Z max and in all but the smallest pond (Quarry Pond), I took two additional samples at either end of the pond to account for spatial variability.',\n",
       " '## Gas concentrations Water samples were collected from 5 to 10 cm below the surface of the water using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex E/S Portable Sampler, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). I collected water in glass BOD bottles, flushed at least twice by their volume while ensuring that no bubbles were produced. I then extracted 110 mL of water using a 140-mL plastic syringe with a three-way stopcock, also being careful to not produce bubbles. I immediately added 30 mL of N 2 , and shook the syringe vigorously for two 2 min to ensure gas equilibrium. I then extracted 15 mL of headspace and stored it in a 12-mL evacuated vial (839 W Exetainer, Labco Limited, Lampeter, UK) until analysis.',\n",

Water samples for phytoplankton chlorophyll a were then filtered onto pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and frozen until analysis. Periphyton and phytoplankton chlorophyll a was measured from the filters using a fluorometer (TD-700 Fluorometer, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, California, USA) following Environmental Protection Agency Method 445.0',\n",

Dissolved organic carbon was analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC 5000 autoanalyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan).',\n",
       " '## Statistical analysis For overall CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations, the two to four replicate samples were averaged for each pond at each sampling round. These biweekly measurements were used to estimate overall means for each gas (n = 89). To evaluate the saturation of each gas relative to the atmosphere, I used the average of monthly air concentrations from April through July for each year from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, USA. The mean CO 2 air concentrations were 398.5 and 400.9 ppm and the mean CH 4 air concentrations were 1.824 and 1.837 ppm for 2013 and 2014, respectively.

The random intercept for pond was selected because it was most parsimonious and did not differ from the other models. Sampling year was not important in any model and was excluded.

Temperature and periphyton chlorophyll a are highly correlated (Table 3), meaning that if periphyton chlorophyll a is included in top models, it could also be interpreted as a possible temperature effect. Models were then fit with all remaining environmental variables (depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and precipitation)',\n",

       " 'There have been fewer studies on CH 4 than CO 2 concentrations in ponds and lakes globally, but comparisons of available data indicate that the CH 4 concentrations in these study ponds were also among the highest reported. The range of CH 4 concentrations reported for ponds and lakes is substantial, with concentrations as low as 0.004 lmol L -1 in an Irish lake (Whitfield et al. 2011) up to 17.93 lmol L -1 in a Hudson Bay Lowland pond (Hamilton et al. 1994). The small wetland ponds found in the Hudson Bay Lowlands have, until now, had the highest reported concentrations of CH 4 : 75 % of ponds were over 38-fold saturated and 25 % of ponds were over 110-fold saturated (Hamilton et al. 1994)',\n",
       " 'Collectively, the CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations reported in this Carbon dioxide concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with DO, with phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH of secondary importance. In many lakes, however, CO 2 concentrations are best predicted by a negative relationship with DOC (or TOC) (Hope et al. 1996;Jonsson et al. 2003;Kelly et al. 2001;Raymond et al. 2013;Roehm et al. 2009;Sobek et al. 2005). This is because for many lakes, allochthonous organic carbon is the largest source of CO 2 production (Karlsson 2007;McCallister and del Giorgio 2008)',\n",
       " 'A closer inspection, however, shows most studies that reported DOC as predicting CO 2 did not evaluate the relationship between CO 2 and DO (but see Roehm et al. 2009).',\n",
       " 'When DO is considered, many studies found a significant negative correlation between CO 2 and DO (Balmer and Downing 2011;Cole et al. 2010;Kankaala et al. 2013;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roulet et al. 1997;Zhang et al. 2013). A few studies even found DO to be a better predictor of CO 2 concentrations compared to DOC (Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005).',\n",
       " 'Whether DOC or DO better predicts CO 2 concentrations likely depends on the physical, chemical, and biological parameters of ponds and lakes. A high correlation between O 2 and CO 2 indicates substantial respiration, oftentimes from the sediments (Jonsson et al. 2003;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roulet et al. 1997). The relationship between O 2 and CO 2 can be stronger in ponds and lakes with high DOC, likely because of high sedimentation of allochthonous carbon (Jonsson et al. 2003). The ponds studied here are strongly influenced by allochthonous carbon because they are small, with a high perimeter to edge ratio. Each year, the ponds receive between 188 and 253 g m -2 year -1 of dry leaf litter (Holgerson, unpubl',\n",
       " 'data), providing an annually-renewed source of POC and DOC (Meyer et al. 1998). Because the ponds are shallow, much of the water is in contact with the sediments where the terrestrial carbon decomposes. Furthermore, sediment respiration can affect the entire water column due to overnight mixing that occurs on the scale of days to weeks (Holgerson, unpubl. data).',\n",
       " 'The large amount of terrestrial carbon settling at the bottom of the pond is likely responsible for high respiration rates, driving O 2 levels down and CO 2 concentrations up. Substantial anaerobic respiration also occurred in the ponds (Fig. 2), supporting the notion that sediment respiration could explain both O 2 and CO 2 concentrations. The importance of sediment respiration in driving CO 2 in small ponds is in contrast to water column DOC driving CO 2 in larger ponds and lakes. This is likely because in larger lakes, allochthonous inputs and the contribution of sediments are lower relative to water volume, and the water column stratifies isolating the effects of the sediments to the hypolimnion. The different conditions between small ponds and larger lakes likely explain why the drivers of surface water CO 2 differ with lake size.',\n",
       " 'The second and third top models for predicting CO 2 concentration included phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH, respectively, as covariates of secondary importance to DO. The estimates for both phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH overlapped with zero, illustrating that these variables are not individually important but do strengthen the relationship between DO and CO 2 . Phytoplankton chlorophyll a negatively correlated with CO 2 , which is intuitive, as increased primary production consumes more CO 2 . Other studies have also seen a negative relationship between CO 2 and phytoplankton (Balmer and Downing 2011;Kosten et al. 2010;Larsen et al. 2011;Roehm et al. 2009), highlighting that CO 2 is affected by production in addition to respiration. The third top model included DO and pH, which also negatively correlated with CO 2',\n",
       " 'This relationship is most likely driven by increased CO 2 concentrations driving down pH (Wetzel 2001).',\n",
       " \"The random effect of pond significantly improved models of CO 2 concentration and increased the best model's R 2 value from 0.23 to 0.60 (Table 4), indicating substantial between-pond variation. Blacksmith Pond had the highest CO 2 concentrations while Long and Woodpile Ponds had the lowest. Perhaps geology, groundwater inputs, turbulent differences, or another environmental variable not measured here played a role in between-pond differences. It is worth noting that while groundwater can be an important source of CO 2 in some freshwater systems (Humborg et al. 2010), there are several indications that groundwater is unlikely to play a major role in these ponds\",\n",
       " 'First, the strong correlation between precipitation and depth (Table 3, r = 0.50) along with low conductivity (\\\\82 lS/cm) indicate that these ponds are fed by precipitation and not groundwater (Brooks 2004(Brooks , 2005;;Palik et al. 2001;Yoshikawa and Hinzman 2003). Additionally, there were no spikes in conductivity as the ponds dried, indicating that more water was lost to seepage than to evaporation and that the ponds recharged groundwater rather than drawing from it (Schneider and Frost 1996). As such, groundwater likely provides minimal CO 2 inputs to these temporary ponds, but there could be variation among sites.',\n",
       " 'Year and sampling round had no significant effect on CO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 concentrations in these ponds were similar inter-and intra-annually. Jonsson et al. (2003) also found no seasonal effect on CO 2 concentrations across 16 Swedish lakes, hypothesizing that there was little metabolic change and that frequent mixing minimized seasonal changes in CO 2 concentrations. In the ponds studied here, metabolic activity likely increased with temperature as exhibited by seasonal increases in periphyton chlorophyll a. I hypothesize that CO 2 concentrations remained steady due to both polymictic mixing and high sediment respiration throughout the season. It is also possible that anaerobic breakdown of DOC and POC shifted more toward methanogenesis seasonally, which could reduce sediment CO 2 production and mask any seasonal increases in CO 2 that would occur if O 2 were more available.',\n",
       " '## Environmental predictors of CH 4 The strongest predictor of CH 4 concentrations in these temporary ponds was precipitation, with periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth being of secondary importance. Increased precipitation was associated with decreased CH 4 concentrations, a contrast with other studies where precipitation increased with CH 4 (Natchimuthu et al. 2014) and CO 2 (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roehm et al. 2009) concentrations or flux. In those studies, increased precipitation was associated with increased DOC in lakes likely due to increased runoff from the landscape (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005). In this study, however, precipitation negatively correlated with DOC (Table 3, r = -0.45)',\n",
       " 'Precipitation events likely influence small ponds differently than larger lakes because of their particular characteristics. Specifically, the volume of these small and shallow ponds responded dramatically to precipitation events. For instance, 21.7 cm of rainfall occurred during the first 2 weeks of June 2013 and as a result, pond depth increased by an average of 23.5 (±7.7 SE) cm (range 5-50 cm). Most ponds (five of the six) are located in defined basins, which prohibited areal expansion and led to dramatic increases in depth. For instance, Quarry and Long Ponds more than doubled in depth whereas Blacksmith Pond, the only pond able to significantly expand in area, only increased by 5 cm in depth.',\n",
       " \"As precipitation dramatically increased depth but not area in five of the six ponds, the relative depth (depth to surface area ratio) increased, causing a dilution effect for many of the pond's biological and chemical parameters. Specifically, increased precipitation correlated with decreased DOC, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDP, TDN, and temperature, and increased DO (Table 3). Many of these effects could alter CH 4 production and concentrations. For instance, DO is negatively correlated with CH 4 concentrations as anoxic sediments or waters are required for methanogenesis (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013)\",\n",
       " 'Methane concentrations are also affected by lake area and depth: small and shallow lakes have more water in contact with anoxic sediments, less opportunity for methane oxidation between the sediments and surface water, and a well-mixed water column that permits benthic CH 4 to reach the surface (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Increased temperature also correlates with greater CH 4 concentrations as methanogenesis increases with temperature (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Interestingly, precipitation led to lower DOC in these ponds, implying an internal source of DOC (e.g. through leaf litter breakdown) that builds up between precipitation events and overmatches any DOC inputs from runoff. Overall, precipitation events dilute the biological and chemical parameters in small ponds, ultimately lowering CH 4 concentrations',\n",
       " 'In addition to dilution, precipitation also increases gas exchange rates (Ho et al. 1997(Ho et al. , 2000)), allowing O 2 to enter ponds and increasing efflux of CO 2 and CO 2 . The observed negative relationship between CH 4 concentrations and precipitation was therefore likely a result of both dilution and increased gas exchange.',\n",
       " 'Models predicting CH 4 concentrations also suggest that periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth were of secondary importance. Periphyton chlorophyll a was not significantly correlated with CH 4 , but did correlate highly with temperature, which was removed from models due to collinearity. As temperature correlated strongly with CH 4 , it is possible that periphyton is acting as a surrogate for temperature in the model, a plausible link as temperature increases methane production (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Phytoplankton chlorophyll a also positively correlated with CH 4 concentration, likely because phytoplankton biomass increased with temperature and decreased with precipitation. Additionally, algal biomass is very labile and could provide another source of organic matter for decomposition. Lastly, depth improved model predictions, but its estimate included zero',\n",
       " 'It is likely that the model derived strength from the correlation between depth and precipitation.',\n",
       " 'There was little between-pond variation in CH 4 concentrations and as such, the random effect of pond only increased the best model R 2 from 0.34 to 0.37 (Table 5). It is worth considering why between-pond variation was important for CO 2 and not for CH 4 . Methane concentrations were likely driven by precipitation, which was similar across all ponds (and imputed as the same number in models). In contrast, CO 2 concentrations were likely driven by sediment respiration, which was more variable among dates and ponds. Random effects of year and sampling round did also not improve CH 4 models, indicating that concentrations were similar between years and season, with major changes driven by precipitation.',\n",
       " '## Small ponds and inland water carbon budgets It is well known that small ponds are more saturated with CO 2 and CH 4 than larger lakes (Bastviken et al. 2004;Kankaala et al. 2013;Raymond et al. 2013); however, this study shows that these very small ponds (\\\\1000 m 2 ) are among the most saturated reported. Using a gas exchange velocity k 600 of 0.36 m day -1 calculated from a propane-addition study in four similar ponds in the study area (E. Farr, unpubl. data), these ponds emit on average 100.6 (±0.51 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CO 2 and 10.6 (±0.13 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CH 4',\n",

It is important to note that this flux estimate does not include CH 4 ebullition, which can be significant in shallow and nutrient-rich ponds and lakes (Bastviken et al. 2004;Casper et al. 2000;Huttunen et al. 2003). Convective mixing could also increase gas exchange at night (Eugster et al. 2003;MacIntyre et al. 2010); however, diurnal patterns of gas exchange in very small ponds need further study.',\n",

In regional carbon budgets, the exclusion of surface waters can overestimate terrestrial NEP by 6-44 % (Buffam et al. 2011;Christensen et al. 2007;Jonsson et al. 2007).

       " 'Fish assemblage structure, and factors and mechanisms appearing important in the ecological maintenance of these structures, were examined for 18 small lakes in northern Wisconsin during summer and winter. The study was focused around the following questions. Are there discrete, repeatable groups of fish assemblages? If so, are they temporally stable? What are the relations between fish assemblage structure and habitat complexity, physical disturbance, biotic interactions, and the insular nature of small lakes? A comparative approach was used to generate hypotheses and propose explanations concerning the roles of these factors in structuring the assemblages.Multivariate classification, ordination, and discriminant analyses helped discern two assemblage types: Umbra-cyprinid and centrarchid-Esox. Each had a distinctive species composition and seasonal change in composition',\n",
       " 'Environmental characteristics of the lakes occupied by each assemblage type also differed consistently.The type of assemblage present in a lake appeared related to oxygen concentrations in winter, interacting with the availability of refuges from either a severe physical environment (low oxygen during winter) or from large piscivores. Centrarchid-Esox assemblages occurred in lakes with high winter oxygen levels, and also in lakes with low oxygen levels if a stream or connecting lake could provide a refuge from these conditions in winter. When no refuge was present, low winter oxygen lakes lacked piscivorous fishes, but contained Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.The relationships between species richness in summer and environmental factors were generally similar for the two assemblage types, but the relative importance of individual factors differed. In winter, richness relationships in centrarchid-Esox assemblages for most environmental factors were reversed from those of summer',\n",
       " 'No significant seasonal change occurred in the Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.Habitat complexity factors, particularly vegetation diversity, were significantly related to summer species richness in both assemblage types. Lake area was also related to summer richness for both types, but the slope of the species-area regression was much steeper for Umbra-cyprinid assemblages than for those in centrarchid-Esox lakes. Species richness relationships with winter oxygen concentration were negative in both seasons in Umbra-cyprinid lakes, but the relationship was positive for centrarchid-Esox assemblages in winter. A measure of lake connectedness was related to summer richness in centrarchid-Esox lakes. These patterns suggest that centrarchid-Esox assemblages are in ecological equilibrium but that a disturbance-induced disequilibrium occurs in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.',\n",
       " \"## INTRODUCTION Our paper examines patterns in the species composition, richness (diversity), and seasonal dynamics of the fish assemblages in 18 small lakes in northern Wisconsin, and discusses factors and mechanisms which appear important in the ecological maintenance of assemblage structure.

       " '## Species diversity theories The ecological literature provides a plethora of theories and hypotheses to explain differences in species diversity among communities. Although all hypotheses are somewhat distinct, they can be grouped together into two major theories; one proposes mechanisms based on equilibrium conditions, the other on the absence of equilibrium (see discussions in Mac Arthur 1972, Connell 1978, Huston 1979).',\n",
       " 'Equilibrium-based mechanisms are inseparably linked to niche structure in communities. In saturated communities, richness is proposed to be a function of the number of discrete resources available, the tolerable niche overlap and minimum niche size possible along a resource gradient, or both (Pianka 1975, 1978, Menge and Sutherland 1976, Connell 1978). If the tolerable niche overlap and minimum niche size are relatively constant (Roughgarden 1974, Werner 1977), species richness should depend upon habitat complexity. Similarly, more productive habitats allow greater dietary specialization and should support more species (Mac Arthur 1972). Equilibrium theories also predict higher diversities in more stable and/or predictable environments (Slobodkin and Sanders 1969)',\n",
       " 'Some ecologists have questioned how often communities meet the assumptions and conditions of equilibrium and propose that nonequilibrium mechanisms dominate (e.g., Wiens 1977, Connell 1978, Huston 1979). Under nonequilibrium conditions, less efficient or poorly adapted species can persist without competitive exclusion, thereby increasing diversity. Competition-induced specialization cannot evolve over ecological time, so if competition does occur under equilibrium conditions, diversity will be reduced by competitive exclusion. At intermediate levels of disturbance a \"dynamic equilibrium\" of increased diversity can be maintained (Connell 1978, Huston 1979).',\n",
       " 'At these levels, disturbances are sufficiently frequent or intense to prevent the community from reaching equilibrium, but still allow some populations to recover.\\nA severe environment that might otherwise be expected to produce a depauperate community may instead produce a more diverse community if refuges are present, reducing the severity. Refuges can also reduce the impact of predation and competition (Dodson 1970, Dayton 1971, Thomson and Lehner 1976), resulting in increased diversity. Woodin (1978) identified five categories of spatial and temporal refuges and argued that communities could be viewed as combinations of species successfully exploiting these refuges.',\n",
       " '## Lakes as islands Another set of factors that should be considered in the examination of fish assemblage structure in small lakes is their insular nature (Barbour and Brown 1974, Magnuson 1976, Browne 1981). One important insular parameter of small lakes is isolation. Relative isolation of an island depends on the likely mode of colonization (flight, drift in ocean currents, etc.). Certainly, seepage lakes without permanent inlets or outlets are more isolated for fishes than are drainage lakes. Measuring the degree of isolation (or connectedness) in drainage lakes is not as straightforward as for oceanic islands.\\nFactors to be considered include the length of the interconnecting waterways and size of the watershed, the degree of differences in habitat between the lakes and connecting streams, and the presence of marked barriers (e.g., waterfalls) between lakes (Magnuson 1976).',\n",
       " 'As with oceanic islands, population size in lakes should be a function of area. Larger lakes should have larger populations, lower probabilities of local extinction, and therefore more species than should smaller lakes (Magnuson 1976).\\nOther components of assemblage structure Knowledge of species diversity alone is insufficient for understanding the organization, dynamics, and controlling mechanisms of assemblages. Assemblages may differ in species composition, reflecting differences in the seasonal responses, environmental regimes, dominance relationships, and controlling factors (Coull and Fleeger 1977). Compositional differences can also result from differential dispersal abilities and extinction probabilities among the potentially available species (Simberloff and Connor 1981).',\n",
       " 'Dynamic properties of the species structures are also important. Cycling of species suites (Coull and Fleeger 1977), differences in seasonal fluctuations of populations (Thomson and Lehner 1976) or historical components (Osman 1977(Osman , 1978) ) can also contribute information about the structure and function of assemblages.\\nA lake system and an approach Our study lakes possess a variety of sizes, shapes, and environmental conditions. During the winter, the extent of low dissolved oxygen conditions varies among the lakes, providing a gradient of environmental disturbance. Different lakes have different morphometries, substrates, and macrophyte vegetation so that the role of habitat complexity in structuring the fish assemblages can be evaluated. Trophic types range from eutrophic and mesotrophic to dystrophic.',\n",
       " 'The lakes are relatively close together and exposed to the same species pool but differ in surface area and degree of connectedness, providing a perspective for considering the insular biogeography of fish assemblages.\\nThe investigation of how environmental factors (physical and biotic) determine the structure of natural assemblages has benefitted greatly from the \"natural experiments\" of comparative studies (e.g., Cody 1974, Diamond 1978, Werner et al. 1978). This method can relatively quickly generate and test hypotheses, assess mechanisms, and produce acceptable explanations for community-level problems under a wide variety of conditions.',\n",

Two small fyke nets (4.6 m leads, four 0.76 m diameter hoops per net, 10 cm throat diameter, 5 mm square mesh) were also used in most lakes, at water depths under the ice of 1-2 m.\",\n",

Traps and nets were set in each lake for approximately 48 h, usually concurrently, but always within 24 h of each other.\\nSummer.-Sampling in summer was similar to the winter. Minnow traps were placed in approximately the same locations and fyke nets were set perpendicularly from shore, immediately shoreward from where they were set in winter. All lakes were sampled with fyke nets during the summer. A trammel net (30.5 x 1.2 m; 18 and 2.5 cm square mesh) was added to increase the variety of sampling gear, and thus to examine the thoroughness of the methods. All gear were set concurrently for 48 h. In August 1979, Mill was resampled, doubling the number of fyke and trammel nets, also to examine sampling thoroughness.',\n",

Water samples were collected 1-3 cm below the ice-water interface with a siphon sampler (Magnuson and Stuntz 1970), and with a Kemmerer bottle centered at 1 m below the interface, if depth permitted. For oxygen analyses, duplicate samples from each depth at each station were fixed immediately in the field and titrated (Winkler method, azide modification, American Public Health Association 1976) in the laboratory later the same day',\n",

In summer, habitat structure was measured for three variables: depth, substrate type, and macrophytes. Measurements were made along the same transects used for the minnow traps, with 15-25 stations in small and/or structurally simple lakes, and 25-35 stations in larger, more complex lakes.

Association analysis (Williams and Lambert 1959), with sum of chi-square as the maximum attribute sum on which cluster division was based, was used. Ordinations were Bray-Curtis types (Bray andCurtis 1957, Post et al. 1973). 1.0-S, (Czekanowski's coefficient) was employed as the distance measure; regression was used for endpoint selection (Post et al. 1973).

For Maple and Spruce, seepage lakes with intermittent outlets, we added only one-half of the downstream watershed area. We believe that these connectedness values, while admittedly somewhat arbitrary, are meaningful ecologically because fishes in drainage lakes have the connecting lakes and streams as both potential refuges during severe conditions, and as source areas for potential immigrants.\\nTo examine the relationships between fish species richness and the lake environments, single and stepwise multiple linear regressions were performed on richness vs. the morphometric, limnological, and habitat diversity factors across all lakes, for each season.',\n",

In this way, a combination of independent variables more successful (in terms of the probability level of the model's F ratio) than that chosen by the standard route could be identified.

We believe that a combination of winter oxygen concentration and lake connectedness is most clearly related to the type of fish assemblage that was present.

In lakes with low oxygen levels, the type of fish assemblage present appears to depend on the presence or absence of a connection to a large watershed, whose streams or lakes can act as refuges from the low oxygen conditions. Lakes having direct connections to a stream or lake had centrarchid-Esox assemblages in summer. Northern pike tended to be the top predator in these lakes. During winter, as oxygen levels dropped, we hypothesize that most fish migrate out of these lakes into stream or lake refuges. In low oxygen lakes without such a refuge, Umbracyprinid assemblages occur.',\n",

J. Magnuson, personal observation), including the aggregation around inlet/outlet streams (Cooper andWashburn 1946, Johnson andMoyle 1969).

When a large creek was disconnected from a shallow, heavily vegetated lake which often experienced low winter oxygen levels, the fish assemblage in the lake was reduced from 11 to 4 species. The species composition changed from one similar to our centrarchid-Esox assemblages to one like our Umbra-cyprinid pattern. Jones (1973) attributed the change to the removal of the creek refuge as a source for annual repopulation of the lake by the centrarchid-Esox assemblage after winter. Other changes in species composition as a result of severe winterkill have been reported in Michigan (Beckman 1948) and Illinois lakes (Bennett 1948).',\n",

Likewise, if both spiney and spineless species co-occurred with piscivores, the spineless species should be selected by the predators (Hoogland et al. 1957, Lewis et al. 1961) and would more likely be eliminated from the lake.',\n",

These sunfishes are generalized foragers, taking a wide variety of invertebrates from the sediments, vegetation, and open water, while the cyprinids often specialize on prey in the plankton (e.g., golden and blacknose shiners), on vegetation (e.g., redbelly dace), or even detritus (fathead minnow) (Keast and Webb 1966, Keast 1970, 1978, Werner and Hall 1976, 1977, 1979, Gascon and Leggett 1977, Werner et al. 1977, Hall et al. 1979)',\n",

The particular combination of habitat structure and prey types and sizes present in centrarchid-Esox lakes may be well suited to the sunfishes, and resulting competition may lead to the exclusion of the Umbra-cyprinid specialists.',\n",

       " 'The predation hypothesis appears to offer the simplest explanation as to why the Umbra-cyprinid species were rarely found in the centrarchid-Esox lakes. Thus, we feel that combinations of physical and biological disturbances and refuges from these disturbance agents are the major factors responsible for the ecological maintenance of these two assemblage types. Specifically, disturbances come in the forms of low oxygen levels during winter, and predation. Refuges are provided by connections to well oxygenated streams or by the absence of predators due to low winter oxygen conditions. In lakes with predators, heavy densities of macrophytes may provide limited refuges from predation, allowing small populations of some Umbra-cyprinid species to persist. Because of these combinations of disturbances and refuges, we agree with Woodin (1978) that communities can be viewed as \"compilations of species successfully exploiting refuges in space and/or time.\"',\n",
       " 'Species richness in the twvo assemblage types\\nProductivity and habitat complexity.-Summer species richness in both assemblage types was highly correlated with measurements related to habitat complexity, particularly vegetation diversity (Table 5).\\nSummer richness in centrarchid-Esox assemblages, but not in the Umbra-cyprinid lakes, was significantly related to factors related to productivity (pH, alkalinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids; Table 5).',\n",
       " 'Habitat complexity has often been implicated as an important determinant of species richness in aquatic habitats. Werner et al. (1978), in a comparison of centrarchid lakes with similar structures from two different regions (Michigan and Florida), suggested the assemblages were \"saturated,\" and that habitat structure and morphometry strongly influenced the numbers of fish species that could coexist. Keast (1978) came to similar conclusions about many of the smaller, glacierformed lakes in North America. Niche segregation and complementarity have been observed in centrarchiddominated assemblages (Werner et al. 1977, 1978, Keast et al. 1978). Since most species\\' niches proved distinct with regard to one or more habitat factors, the number of coexisting fish species should increase with increased habitat complexity and heterogeneity.',\n",
       " 'Species diversity in several stream fish assemblages is also closely related to habitat complexity (Sheldon 1968, Tramer and Rogers 1973, Gorman and Karr 1978).\\nIf the habitat complexity: niche complementarity:\\nspecies richness relationship applies in our assemblages, vegetation diversity should be identified as a major factor related to species richness. Because we limited the range of substrates and depths by our selection of lakes, ranges of diversity were relatively small for these habitat factors. Thus, if habitat complexity contributed to species richness, vegetation represents the primary habitat dimension along which niche segregation and species packing could be demonstrated in our study. Also, we noted previously that vegetation may provide refuges from predation in centrarchid-Esox lakes and contribute to higher species richness.',\n",
       " 'More productive habitats should allow for greater dietary specialization under conditions of evolutionary equilibrium (Mac Arthur 1972). Certain resources in productive habitats may be able to support a species when they would be unable to do so in unproductive habitats (Mac Arthur 1965). Productivity, particularly associated with increased benthic and planktonic food levels, has been related to fish species diversity elsewhere (Nakashima et al. 1977). The reason(s) why productivity-related factors appear important in centrarchid-Esox assemblages but not in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages is not known, but might be related to a dichotomy between equilibrium and nonequilibrium assemblage types. This idea will be discussed below.\\nEnvironmental disturbance.-In Umbra-cyprinid lakes higher species richness in summer was associated with lower levels of dissolved oxygen in winter.',\n",
       " 'This may imply a disturbance-related mechanism. The lowest oxygen levels (0.07 mg/L in Gateway, 0.52 mg/ L in Grassy, 0.56 mg/L in Mystery) are usually considered \"severe,\" capable of killing many species (Moore 1942, Cooper andWashburn 1946). Yet these lakes were the richest of the Umbra-cyprinid lakes.\\nEnvironmental disturbance, including severity, instability, and unpredictability, has been associated',\n",
       " 'with both increased and decreased diversity in many aquatic and terrestrial systems. Kushlan (1976), Mahon and Balon (1977) and Horwitz (1978) all found lower fish species diversity in unstable environments. Werner et al. (1978) felt that some of the differences in fish assemblages between their lakes derived from fluctuations in water level. Gorman and Karr (1978) found that their significantly positive relationships between habitat diversity and fish species diversity broke down in stream environments that were unstable due to flooding or human activities.',\n",
       " 'At \"intermediate\" levels of frequency or intensity, environmental disturbance can promote species richness (Connell 1978, Huston 1979). An excellent example is the work on a marine epifaunal community by Osman (1977). Diversity was highest on intermediate-sized rocks because of their \"optimal\" frequency of disturbance. Thomson and Lehner (1976) indicated that environmental instability may have favored increased diversity in an intertidal fish assemblage. In spite of the growing theoretical discussions and field evidence from a variety of communities, we are unaware of any studies that demonstrate, or even implicate, environmental disturbance as a major mechanism promoting species richness in freshwater fish assemblages. This cannot be due to the absence of  Larimore et al',\n",

       " 'Low winter oxygen levels might increase species richness simply by acting as a rarefying agent, reducing population levels below saturation so that species coexistence is possible at less intense competition.\\nThis would particularly be likely if the most susceptible species to winterkill are the dominant predators or competitors of the assemblage (W. M. Tonn, personal observation). Beckman (1948) and Bennett (1948) found that growth increased in fish surviving population reductions caused by a severe winterkill and attributed this to increased food per fish. Apparently, competition for food had been reduced.',\n",
       " 'In winter, richness in centrarchid-Esox assemblages was higher in lakes with higher winter oxygen levels (Table 5). Thus, richer winter assemblages of this type occurred in the more \"benign\" environments in terms of oxygen concentrations, the opposite of that found in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages. Winter oxygen levels were as low in Umbra-cyprinid lakes as in the depauperate centrarchid-Esox lakes, though they were apparently not as \"severe\" to the more tolerant Umbracyprinid species, and thus did not supress winter richness. This also implicates an \"intermediate\" disturbance mechanism operating to increase richness in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.',\n",
       " 'Lake environments with low oxygen levels may be \"severe\" for the centrarchid-Esox species, reducing winter richness in the lakes themselves. However, the availability of stream/lake refuges may effectively eliminate any significant \"disturbance\" to the populations, so that when the fish return to the lake in the spring, the summer species richness of the lake returns to its relatively high level. Thus, although the seasonal richness patterns in the lakes themselves were measured to be unstable, the equilibria of the populations might be maintained.',\n",
       " 'Insular factors.-The second factor included in the multiple regression analysis of richness in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages was surface area (Table 5). Barbour and Brown (1974) were the first to look at fish species richness in lakes as a problem of island biogeography. Their analysis of species-area curves, primarily in large lakes, yielded slopes of the log-log regressions that tended to be lower for lake fishes than for plants and animals on oceanic islands. They attributed this to either the relative homogeneity of lake environments as compared to isolated terrestrial habitats, and/ or to historical events that may tend to prevent large lakes from acquiring as many species as they can support ecologically.',\n",
       " 'The summer species-area slope for the Uinbra-cyprinid assemblages was 0.62, much higher than the range discussed by Barbour and Brown (1974) for assemblages with greater than equilibrial numbers of species. For centrarchid-Esox assemblages, the slope was 0.29, in the middle of the range noted by Barbour and Brown for lakes whose fish assemblages are in equilibrium between colonization and extinction.\\nWhile the cause(s) of these different species-area relationships are not known, the values are consistent with the hypothesis that centrarchid-Esox assemblages are in ecological equilibrium, while disturbance-induced disequilibrium characterizes Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.',\n",
       " 'Summer species richness in the centrarchid-Esox assemblages was also significantly related to the biogeographically important factor of insular connectedness (Table 5). A lake which has greater insular connectedness should have an increased immigration rate and a richer assemblage at equilibrium (Mac Arthur andWilson 1967, Magnuson 1976).',\n",
       " '## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS We summarize the structural characteristics of the fish assemblages in our small lakes by a list of assembly patterns.

       " '3) Small species tolerant to low oxygen, such as the mudminnow and several cyprinids, form important year-round components of the fish assemblages in lakes without piscivores (D). 4) In those lakes containing large piscivores, the remaining fishes are dominated by medium-sized, spiney-rayed species such as centrarchids, bullheads and yellow perch. The small, soft-rayed species of the piscivore-free assemblages are either rare or absent in lakes with large piscivores, just as centrarchids, along with piscivores, are absent from low winter oxygen lakes (D).',\n",
       " '## 5) In small seepage lakes with high winter oxygen levels, the top predator tends to be largemouth bass. The fish assemblages are similar in summer and winter (D). 7) Winter oxygen level is an important determinant of species richness in \"Umbra-cyprinid\" lakes in both summer and winter. The relationship is negative and suggests a disturbance-related mechanism operating to increase richness. The species-area slope for these assemblages also is consistent with the hypothesis that disturbance-induced rarefaction is maintaining greater than equilibrial numbers of species in the richer of these assemblages (I).\\n8) Productivity, habitat complexity, and lake connectedness are significantly related to summer species richness in \"centrarchid-Esox\" lakes.',\n",
       " 'These are basic components of equilibrium theories of diversity. The species-area slope of these assemblages is in the range of lakes whose fish assemblages are hypothesized to be at equilibrium (I).\\nThe identification of these assembly patterns describes what we feel are ecologically striking fish assemblage structures which appear to result from deterministic mechanisms of assemblage maintenance.\\nOnly now that these patterns have been described can meaningful, specific hypotheses be tested by intensive autecological or experimental studies.',\n",

Forest lakes were poorer in nutrients, phytoplankton, and primary production, but richer in dissolved organic matter and CO 2 than open lakes with more light available. The modeled annual balance between gross primary production and community respiration (GPP/R COM ) averaged 0.60 in forest lakes and 0.76 in open lakes and the ratio increased significantly with phosphorus concentration and phytoplankton biomass but decreased with colored dissolved organic matter. The negative daily rates of ecosystem production resembled estimates of oxygen uptake from the atmosphere to the lakes, whereas estimates of CO 2 emission were 7.2-fold higher',\n",
       " 'Although CO 2 -rich groundwater and anaerobic respiration support greater molar release of CO 2 than uptake of O 2 , we suggest CO 2 emission is overestimated. Possible explanations include CO 2 enrichment of the air film above small wind-sheltered lakes. The observed metabolism and gas exchange show that exogenous organic matter is an important supplementary energy source to community respiration in these small lakes and that forest lakes, in addition, experience pronounced light attenuation from trees and dissolved colored organic matter constraining primary production.',\n",
       " '## INTRODUCTION Small lakes have several physico-chemical and biological features in common because small sur-face areas statistically are linked to shallow water, wind shelter, and low mixing depth, while they possess a long shore line for input of airborne terrestrial organic matter relative to lake surface area and volume (Straskraba 1980;Duarte and Kaff 1989;Fee and others 1996). The hydrological input of organic matter and nutrients across the terrestrial-aquatic boundary is also high relative to surface area in lakes of similar character when the drainage ratio (catchment area/lake area) is high. Small lakes are, in addition, grossly influenced by shading from the terrestrial vegetation and by soil richness and land-use in the immediate surroundings (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007)',\n",
       " 'In broad-scale comparisons of Danish lakes, small lakes are generally richer in nutrients, dissolved organic matter, and free CO 2 than large lakes located in the same surroundings (Søndergaard and others 2005;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007).',\n",
       " 'Small lakes in forest catchments have reduced inputs of light and easily accessible dissolved nutrients for phytoplankton production compared to lakes in fertilized agricultural landscapes (Larsen and others 1995). Forest cover should, therefore, be associated with lower nutrient status, phytoplankton biomass, and gross primary production (GPP) in the lakes (Jackson and Hecky 1980). Input of organic detritus from the forest, on the other hand, stimulates growth and metabolism of bacteria and zooplankton, enhances community respiration (R COM ), and constrains phytoplankton production due to greater background shading from colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM; Christensen and others 1996;Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998;Jonsson andothers 2001, 2003)',\n",
       " 'Consequently, brown-colored forest lakes should display stronger net heterotrophy than open, clear-water lakes (Del Giorgio and others 1999;Sobek and others 2002). Although increasing nutrient richness is believed to stimulate autotrophy more than heterotrophy (Cole and others 2000), input of easily degradable organic matter will have the opposite effect (Schindler and others 1997). It is, therefore, possible that small eutrophic lakes can still exhibit distinct net heterotrophy, but these aspects have not been thoroughly tested so far.',\n",
       " 'In this study, we compared phytoplankton biomass, particulate and dissolved organic matter, metabolic rates, and exchanges of CO 2 and O 2 with the atmosphere in small, alkaline seepage lakes in either predominantly open agricultural landscapes or deciduous forests in the rich moraine landscape in North Zealand, Denmark. Our main hypothesis was that these small, meso-eutrophic lakes can be net heterotrophic and release CO 2 to the atmosphere because of respiration of exogenous dissolved organic matter or processes related to this input. Our additional hypothesis was that nutrient concentration, phytoplankton biomass, and gross primary production are higher and dissolved organic matter and net heterotrophy are lower in open lakes than in forest lakes. Thus, supersaturation and emission of CO 2 to the atmosphere and undersaturation and influx of O 2 to the water as indices of net heterotrophy should be higher in forest lakes than in open lakes.',\n",
       " '## MATERIALS AND METHODS ## Study Sites and Sampling We examined 19 small, alkaline lakes (0.3-22 ha, median 10.5; 2.7-6.1 meq l -1 , median 2.6) located in calcareous, nutrient-rich moraines near the town of Hillerød in North Zealand, Denmark (Table 1). Mean pH-values in surface waters ranged from 7.2 to 8.2 because of CO 2 supersaturation and were markedly lower than the pH of 8.2-8.5 attained at CO 2 equilibrium with atmospheric air (Stumm and Morgan 1996). Land use was determined from air photographs in a 200 m zone around the lakes. Forest cover ranged from 1% to 96% among the lakes',\n",
       " 'Lakes were fed by groundwater, rainwater, and intermittent surface flow and, except for three lakes (that is, Slotssø, Teglga ˚rdssø, and Strødam Engsø) they lacked permanent stream inputs. Water residence time and loading with organic matter and nutrients were not known for most lakes. In small forest lakes, shed leaves were the main input of exogenous particulate organic matter. All lakes were shallow with mean depths ranging from 1 to 3.5 m. The water had measured mean vertical light attenuation coefficients (K D , 400-700 nm) ranging from 1.0 to 5.2 m -1 (Table 1)',\n",
       " 'Light attenuation coefficients in all lakes on all sampling dates were calculated from measurements (see below) of total suspended dry matter (TSM), algal biomass (Chl a), and absorbance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) by applying the optical model described in Sand- Jensen and Staehr (2007). Small lakes surrounded by tall forest trees experience very pronounced shading from the trees. The reduction of surface irradiance (SI) has previously been quantified in the region as a function of lake size across the size range studied here (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). This model was used to calculate surface irradiance in the present set of lakes.',\n",
       " \"## Water Chemistry, Clarity, and Phytoplankton Pigments Lakes were sampled eight times from November 2000 to November 2001. All physico-chemical and biological measurements were made in triplicate. Water temperatures were between 1°C and 24°C during this period and lakes were ice-free during sampling. Temperature was measured and water sampled at 0.3 m depth in the center of the homogeneously mixed lakes between 10 and 12 o'clock. Water for chemical and physical measurements was transferred to 10 l plastic containers and analyzed on the same day or frozen for later anal-Net Heterotrophy in Small Lakes yses of total-nitrogen (TN) and total-phosphorus (TP) according to Strickland and Parsons (1968). Total suspended dry matter (TSM) was determined by filtration on pre-weighed GF/C-filters followed by drying at 105°C and weighing\",\n",
       " 'The filtrate was further filtered (<0.2 lm) to remove bacteria and other fine particles and absorbance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) was measured at several wavelengths (340-460 nm) in a 5-cm cuvette in a Shimadzu spectrophotometer (UV-160A) and expressed as CDOM absorption (m -1 ) as recommended by Cuthbert and del Giorgio (1992) and Kirk (1994) by multiplying with 2.3 (from log 10 to log e ) and dividing by the optical path length (0.05 m). CDOM absorption at 360 nm is presented here, whereas the highly reproducible logarithmic decline of absorption from 340 to 460 nm was used to calculate mean absorption for the photosynthetic range (400-700 nm) in the optical model (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007)',\n",
       " 'In comprehensive measurements from Danish eutrophic lakes and streams, DOC concentrations (mg C l -1 ) increased linearly with CDOM absorption at 360 nm (m -1 ) according to the equation: DOC = 0.454 CDOM 360 + 1.9 (r 2 = 0.80, n = 399, Stedmon, unpublished). Samples for chlorophyll a and pheopigments were collected on AdvantecÒ GC-50 filters, extracted with 96% ethanol for 24 h and measured according to the method described by Parsons and others (1984).',\n",
       " '## Metabolism and Gas Exchange Measurements just before noon approximately represent the daily average concentrations of CO 2 and O 2 (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). Water for determination of O 2 , pH, and calculations of CO 2 was transferred to closed, dark glass bottles to avoid CO 2 and O 2 exchange with the air and prevent photosynthesis before measurement in the laboratory within 2 h. pH was measured with radiometer equipment (accuracy 0.01 pH unit) and O 2 with stirring insensitive Clark-type microelectrodes (Unisense; accuracy 0.01 mg O 2 l -1 ). Measurements of ionic strength, alkalinity, and pH were used to calculate concentrations of free CO 2 according to Rebsdorf (1972)',\n",
       " 'The calculated CO 2 concentrations have previously been shown to be in close agreement with direct CO 2 measurements on an IRGA using a headspace equilibration technique (Sand-Jensen and Frost-Christensen 1998).',\n",
       " 'The pH-alkalinity approach was used because we were able to analyze the large number of samples with better reproducibility than by the IRGA approach.\\nPercent saturation of O 2 and CO 2 was calculated as the ratio of the measured gas concentration and the gas concentration in water in equilibrium with the atmosphere at ambient temperature. A standard table was used to compute oxygen saturation from water temperature. CO 2 saturation was calculated as a function of mean CO 2 partial pressure (380 ppm) in air at the time of investigation and water temperature according to Plummer and Busenberg (1982).',\n",
       " 'Gas fluxes of O 2 and CO 2 across the air-water interface were calculated as the product of the gas exchange coefficient (piston velocity, k, cm h -1 ) and the concentration gradient: D = k ([gas] meas -[gas] sat ). Piston velocity was estimated from k 600 and the ratio of Schmidt numbers as k = k 600 *((Sc/600) -0.5 ) according to Jahne and others (1987). k 600 (k for a Schmidt number (Sc) of 600) was estimated as a function of wind speed at 10 m above the lake surface as: k 600 (cm h -1 ) = 2.07 + 0.215wind 1.7 according to Cole and Caraco (1998)',\n",
       " 'Measurements during several years in some of these small lakes have confirmed that wind speed is indeed low (0-3 m s -1 ) for more than 90% of the time (Closter 2007). We therefore applied a wind speed of 2 m s -1 for all dates. The flux equation for CO 2 is analogous to that of O 2 but includes a factor, a, which represents the chemical enhancement of diffusion, which occurs at high pH and during low wind speeds when the stagnant layer is thick. We used the approach in Bade and Cole (2006) to compute a.',\n",
       " 'Metabolic rates in the pelagic waters were measured in triplicate by standard oxygen experiments in closed glass bottles (25 ml) mounted on a rotating wheel in a temperature-constant incubator set at ambient temperature. Net oxygen production at light saturation (NP max ) of the plankton community was determined as the increase of oxygen concentrations in the water exposed to a saturating irradiance of 400 lmol photons m -2 s -1 for 6-18 h. Respiration of the plankton (R) was measured as the decline of oxygen concentrations in dark bottles for 18-42 h. Long incubations were used when rates were lowest. Oxygen concentrations were measured using the microelectrode equipment. Gross primary production at light saturation (GPP max ) was calculated in the conventional way as the sum of NP max and R assuming that dark respiration continues at unaltered rates in the light.',\n",
       " 'Benthic respiration was measured in triplicate sediment cores retrieved in Kajak Perspex cylinders (5.2 cm in diameter) from the central part of the lakes in April-May and incubated in the dark at 12°C for 1-2 days. Oxygen consumption was Net Heterotrophy in Small Lakes determined as the rate of decline of dissolved O 2 in the enclosed water volume overlying the sediment. Water was stirred by a magnetic stirrer bar during incubation. Benthic respiration was corrected for respiration in the water overlying the sediment cores by parallel incubation of water alone. Benthic respiration measurements were assumed to be representative for the entire lake and the full year. This is obviously a crude assumption which does not account for spatial and temporal variability in the amount of labile organic matter',\n",
       " 'We regard the incubation temperature of 12°C as a suitable choice because if respiration rates change with temperature with a standard Q 10 -value of 2.0, annual means of respiration rates corrected to monthly temperatures over the year available for two lakes in the region (Closter 2007) yielded values within ±5% of the value at 12°C.',\n",
       " 'Total daily lake respiration (R COM ) was calculated by multiplying hourly rates of volumetric pelagic respiration with 24 h and mean water depth and adding benthic respiration. Pelagic waters were usually well mixed and had little spatial variability, whereas greater spatial variability is expected for benthic respiration which may, as already mentioned, generate uncertainty by up-scaling to the entire lake ecosystem. Total daily gross primary production (GPP) was calculated from maximum light-saturated gross production in the pelagic waters (GP max , mol O 2 m -3 h -1 ), the attenuation coefficient (K D , m -1 ), number of light hours per day (LDH, h day -1 , Jensen 2000) according to the empirical model of Talling 1957, (his Eq. 5), but modified to correct for forest shading by multiplying by mean irradiance at the lake surface as a proportion of irradiance in the open (SI):',\n",
       " 'Daily rates were integrated over the year by linear interpolation between successive measurements. The contribution of submerged macrophytes and benthic microalgae was not included in our estimate of ecosystem production. Emergent macrophytes were present in shallow water of the lakes but they exchange O 2 and CO 2 with the atmosphere during their photosynthetic production, whereas they decompose in the water upon senescence like the input of terrestrial organic matter. The growth of submerged macrophytes was negligible in most lakes. There will, however, be a certain contribution of benthic microalgae to ecosystem production (Vadeboncoeur andothers 2001, 2003), although high shading from forest trees surrounding the small lakes and high light attenuation in the plankton-rich and brown-colored water will restrict this productivity as well. Thus, we acknowledge that ecosystem GPP and GPP/R values are probably underestimated by not including the benthic production of microalgae.',\n",
       " '## Statistics To determine the correlations between forest cover,\\nseason, physico-chemical and biological variables a Pearson correlation matrix was established. To specifically evaluate the influence of forest cover and season, lakes were first divided into 11 predominantly open lakes (1-42% forest cover, median 27%) and 8 predominantly forest lakes (50-96% forest cover, median 64%) with no overlap in forest cover between the two groups and no difference in lake size. Data were log-transformed, when necessary, to fulfill the requirements of parametric analysis.',\n",

       " 'All 19 small lakes had high nutrient concentrations (seasonal means: 25-285 lg TP l -1 , 521-2489 lg TN l -1 ) and phytoplankton biomasses (seasonal means: 8-100 lg Chl l -1 ) corresponding to mesotrophic to very eutrophic conditions (Figure 1). Nutrient concentrations (TN and TP) were higher (P < 0.088) in open lakes than in shaded forest lakes (Figure 1) and negative correlations of nutrient concentrations to forest cover among lakes were significant (Table 2). Total suspended matter (TSM) and phytoplankton biomass (Chl a) in pelagic water declined significantly with higher forest cover, whereas CDOM absorption, CDOM/Chl a, and free CO 2 concentrations increased (Table 2). Phytoplankton biomass increased significantly with TP (Table 2)',\n",
       " 'All lakes were strongly supersaturated with CO 2 during autumn and winter, whereas CO 2 supersaturation during summer was weaker (Figure 1). CO 2 concentrations were lowest in forest lakes in early May and in open lakes in June-July. Among eight forest lakes, 97% of CO 2 measurements displayed supersaturation with an annual median value of about 975% air saturation. Among 11 open lakes, 87% of the measurements showed CO 2 -supersaturation and the annual median value was about 710% air saturation. O 2 concentrations in surface waters were greatly undersaturated during autumn and winter, close to atmospheric equilibrium in May and June, and only supersaturated in July (Figure 1). Forest lakes and open lakes were undersaturated with O 2 in 75% of measurements',\n",
       " 'The extent of CO 2 supersaturation was significantly positively correlated with the extent of O 2 undersaturation (Table 2).',\n",
       " \"Concentrations of free CO 2 declined significantly with TSM and increased highly significantly with CDOM absorption according to a hyperbolic relationship (Table 2, Figure 2). The range of mean CDOM absorption (6-34 m -1 ) among the lakes corresponds to dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) between approximately 4 and 18 mg C l -1 according to the general empirical relationship of DOC to CDOM absorption (see section ''Materials and Methods''). In multiple regression analyses (log transformed data) only the positive relationship to CDOM contributed significantly to the prediction of daily mean CO 2 concentrations, whereas the positive influence of forest cover and the negative influence of phytoplankton biomass were not significant but may exert their influence through inter-correlations with CDOM.\",\n",
       " '## Production and Respiration For the entire lake ecosystem, daily gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R COM ) were significantly positively related to TP, Chl a, and TSM (Table 2). R COM increased along with GPP, being a main source of respiratory substrates, and in most cases R COM exceeded GPP (Figure 3). Benthic respiration was responsible for 44 ± 5% (mean ± 95% CL) of community respi-  ration in open lakes and 37 ± 5% in forest lakes, whereas pelagic respiration accounted for the remainder. The GPP/R COM -ratio declined with forest cover (Table 2), but the difference between forest lakes and open lakes was only significant when seasonal changes were accounted for (data not shown)',\n",
       " 'The GPP/R COM -ratio increased significantly with TP, TSM, and phytoplankton biomass, and declined significantly with CDOM and CDOM/ Chl a (Table 2). Gross primary production was much higher during summer than during autumn and winter (Figure 4). Although community respiration dis-played the same overall seasonal pattern, differences between summer and winter were less pronounced (Figure 4). This is in part due to the application of a constant sediment respiration, but seasonal changes in the pelagic community were also larger for phytoplankton net production (coefficient of variation, CV: 61%) than plankton community respiration (CV: 48%).

Estimated CO 2 emissions were higher during autumn-winter than summer and annual mean CO 2 emission was 43.0 mol m -2 y -1 in forest lakes and 27.3 mol m -2 y -1 in open lakes (Table 3). Estimated influxes of O 2 were complementary to CO 2 emissions being higher during autumn-winter than summer and annual values were slightly higher in forest lakes (5.1 mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) than in open lakes (4.4 mol O 2 m -2 y -1 )',\n",
       " 'A highly significant inverse relationship was observed between CO 2 and O 2 fluxes among lakes over time in accordance with the complementary role of the two gases in photosynthesis and aerobic respiration (Figure 5). It is noteworthy, that a positive CO 2 -efflux was estimated at a zero O 2 -flux and that the slope of O 2 -flux versus CO 2 -flux was -0.41 and significantly less negative than -1.0 implying that, on a molar basis, estimated CO 2 emission was much higher than estimated O 2 uptake. Emission of CO 2 and uptake of O 2 both increased with falling GPP/R COM -ratio and more negative net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP -R COM )',\n",

       " '## DISCUSSION ## Influence of Forest Cover and Dissolved Organic Matter The small lakes examined here exhibited significantly declining concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass with greater forest cover, whereas CDOM absorption and CO 2 supersaturation increased (Table 2). Input of soil nutrients is generally much lower in lakes located in forests than in open lakes located in cultivated landscapes (Larsen and others 1995). Input of leaves and dissolved organic matter, on the other hand, is high from forested catchments and can support microbial growth and microbial respiration in forest lakes contributing to their profound CO 2 supersaturation (Tranvik 1992). These conditions can account for the observed differences between forest lakes and open lakes',\n",
       " 'In addition, extra input of dissolved organic matter will impede phytoplankton biomass due to the enhanced background light attenuation which competes with phytoplankton pigments for available light as shown by phytoplankton growth models and laboratory tests under nutrient replete conditions (Huisman and Weissing 1994;Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998)',\n",

DOC from 5 to 17 mg l -1 , resembling the DOC range in our lake comparison, was estimated to reduce phytoplankton biomass and primary production corresponding to a 10-fold decline of the external P-loading rate (Carpenter and others 1998) because higher phytoplankton biomass (and more P) is required to absorb the same proportion of incident irradiance. In our lake comparison, CDOM absorption was negatively related to GPP/ R COM (Table 2). The quotient CDOM/Chl a directly reflects the competition between background absorption and photosynthetic pigment absorption (Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998) and it was significantly negatively related to GPP and GPP/ R COM (Table 2)',\n",
       " 'We, therefore, agree with Pace and others (2007) that CDOM/Chl a could be a suitable and easily measurable predictor of the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous carbon to plankton consumers.',\n",
       " '## Lake Metabolism and Net Heterotrophy Community respiration exceeded gross primary production in all lakes stressing the net heterotrophic character of both nutrient-rich open lakes and forest lakes with high input of allochthonous organic carbon. Exogenous organic substrates offer an additional source to R COM that may explain why CO 2 is emitted to the atmosphere and O 2 is taken up and why their magnitudes are positively related to CDOM (Table 2, Figure 2). This finding corresponds well with the positive relationship of CO 2 to DOC of boreal lakes (Sobek and others 2005). Gross primary production and community respiration both increased significantly under more nutrient-rich conditions in lakes having high phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations (Table 2)',\n",
       " 'The close relationship of community respiration to phytoplankton biomass and production (Table 2, Figure 3) can result from a direct role of phytoplankton in the respiratory budget and an indirect role when phytoplankton carbon is consumed by bacteria and animals. GPP increased more than R COM by increasing nutrient richness supporting earlier suggestions of greater stimulation of autotrophy than heterotrophy (Schindler and others 1997;Cole and others 2000;Duarte and Prairie 2005). Uptake of O 2 from the atmosphere declined under more nutrient-rich conditions, though not significantly (P = 0.10).',\n",

These annual balances are estimated by a combined optical-photosynthesis model using measurements of pelagic metabolism and attenuating TSM, CDOM, and Chl a on eight occasions during the year, but only one measurement series of benthic respiration. No contribution of benthic production was included. Despite these uncertainties, the calculations gain credibility by showing the same systematic pattern among lakes that all had negative NEP-values and of the same magnitude as O 2 influx from the atmosphere calculated independently.',\n",

Experiments directly demonstrate that removal of leaf input to forest ponds reduces R COM and makes NEP less negative (Rubbo and others 2006)',\n",
       " 'Moreover, experimental addition of inorganic 13 C to entire lakes and subsequent measurements of d 13 C in different pelagic organic pools confirm the relatively greater support by terrestrially derived organic carbon to planktonic consumers as lake size and trophy decrease and dissolved organic color increases (Pace and others 2007). The 19 small lakes included in our analysis all have a close contact to land and a substantial input of both airborne and waterborne terrestrial organic matter that can support respiratory processes in the lakes. We confirm that negative NEP-values are a widespread feature over gradients in trophic status and land cover of small Danish lakes, including very eutrophic ones.',\n",
       " 'Organic matter dissolved in the water flowing to forest lakes in our study region showed a mean degradability of 1.5 mmol C l -1 over 10 months (Sand-Jensen, unpublished) which would give rise to annual CO 2 emission rates from the lakes of 0.75-3.0 mol m -2 for typical water retention times of 0.5-2 years (Algesten and others 2003). Degradable particulate organic matter of about one-third this magnitude may be carried by surface flow (Sand-Jensen and Pedersen 2005). Annual airborne leaf input from deciduous forest vegetation typically amounts to 250-500 g C per m along the lake shore (Fisher and Likens 1973) corresponding to 0.4-2.7 mol C m -2 for our main range Net Heterotrophy in Small Lakes of lake sizes (0.3-3.1 ha)',\n",

In contrast, our estimates of CO 2 emission rates are much higher.',\n",
       " '## Gas Fluxes and Excessive CO 2 Emission We estimated much greater molar rates of CO 2emission than O 2 -uptake in our lakes. The regression slope between CO 2 emission and O 2 uptake was 2.4. If aerobic degradation of exogenous organic matter in the lakes is the main source of this CO 2 emission and O 2 uptake we should expect a molar ratio of CO 2 /O 2 close to 1.0. Anaerobic sediment respiration by use of alternative electron acceptors (nitrate, sulfate, and oxidized iron and manganese) and input of supersaturated groundwater would support greater molar release of CO 2 than uptake of O 2 (Torgersen and Branco 2007)',\n",
       " 'Anaerobic sediment processes in a small, shallow, and rapidly flushed Connecticut pond (for example, denitrification and fermentation) have been invoked to explain the imbalance between the much greater annual release of 29.2 and 30.3 mol CO 2 m -2 from the pond surface to the atmosphere in 2 years than the uptake of only 2.7 mol O 2 m -2 in 1 year and release of 9.1 mol O 2 m -2 in the other year (Torgersen and Branco 2008)',\n",
       " 'We find it more likely for our small Danish lakes that the high CO 2 /O 2 ratio and the high emission rate of CO 2 hide an error in the CO 2 -emission estimate because the estimated inputs of groundwater CO 2 , the internal CO 2 release by loss of alkalinity, and the degradation of external input of organic matter, approximately matching O 2 uptake from the atmosphere, are not sufficiently large to account for the CO 2 -emission estimate',\n",
       " 'Groundwater in the region is greatly supersaturated with free CO 2 (400-1000 lM, Sand-Jensen and others 1995) which corresponds to annual emissions of 0.2-2 mol CO 2 m -2 of lake surface at typical water retention times of 0.5-2 years which is too low to account for the high estimates of CO 2 emission rates, though it will contribute to CO 2 /O 2 exchange ratios with the atmosphere above 1.0 (Figure 5). An additional CO 2 source is loss of alkalinity by precipitation and permanent burial of CaCO 3 and silicate minerals in the lake sediments (McConnaughey and others 1994). Permanent sedimentation of CaCO 3 is low, however, in these predominantly CO 2 supersaturated lakes.',\n",
       " 'Accordingly, our CO 2 emission rates are perhaps overestimated because piston velocities or CO 2 gradients from water to air are overestimated or both. Piston velocities for O 2 and CO 2 used here resembled each other (Liss and Merlivat 1986), but direct comparisons are needed for small, wind sheltered lakes where organic surface layers can be prominent (Frew and others 2004). CO 2 gradients across the water-air interface are overestimated if pre-noon CO 2 concentrations in the water exceed daily averages and if CO 2 in the stagnant air film exceeds standard atmospheric concentrations. No CO 2 measurements are available for air films, but values of 150-200% saturation have been measured 1 m above the water surface of CO 2 supersaturated streams on 5 calm mornings, whereas values close to 100% saturation were recorded on 13 mornings with more wind (Christensen 2000)',\n",

       " 'In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the small Danish lakes are systematically net heterotrophic, that even very eutrophic lakes remain net heterotrophic and that O 2 uptake corresponds to the negative net ecosystem productivity probably driven by input of organic matter from land. Although CO 2 input from groundwater and surface flow, internal CO 2 generation by anaerobic respiration and precipitation of minerals support higher CO 2 emission than O 2 uptake, the presented CO 2 emission rates are probably overestimated and deserve future attention.',\n",

       " '# Quantifying saltmarsh vegetation and its effect on wave height dissipation: Results from a UK East coast saltmarsh\\n## Abstract',\n",
       " 'The degree to which incident wind waves are attenuated over intertidal surfaces is critical to the development of coastal wetlands, which are, amongst other processes, affected by the delivery, erosion, and/or resuspension of sediment due to wave action. Knowledge on wave attenuation over saltmarsh surfaces is also essential for accurate assessments of their natural sea-defence value to be made and incorporated into sea defence and management schemes. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the use of a digital photographic method for the quantification of marsh vegetation density and then to investigate the relative roles played by hydrodynamic controls and vegetation density/type in causing the attenuation of incident waves over a macro-tidal saltmarsh.Results show that a significant statistical relationship exists between the density of vegetation measured in side-on photographs and the dry biomass of the photographed vegetation determined through direct harvesting',\n",
       " 'The potential of the digital photographic method for the spatial and temporal comparison of marsh surface vegetation biomass, density, and canopy structure is highlighted and the method was applied to assess spatial and seasonal differences in vegetation density and their effect on wave attenuation at three locations on a macro-tidal saltmarsh on Dengie Peninsula, Essex, UK. In this environmental setting, vegetation density/type did not have a significant direct effect on wave attenuation but modified the process of wave transformation under different hydrodynamic conditions. At the two locations, characterised by a relatively tall canopy (15e26 cm) with biomass values of 430e500 g m À2 , dominated by Spartina spp. (>70% of total dry biomass), relative incident wave height (wave height/water depth) is identified as a statistically significant dominant positive control on wave attenuation up to a threshold value of 0.55, beyond which wave attenuation showed no significant further increase',\n",
       " 'At the third location, characterised by only slightly less biomass (398 g m À2 ) but a shorter (6 cm) canopy of the annual Salicornia spp., no significant relationship existed between wave attenuation and relative wave height. Seasonally (between September and December) significant temporal increase/decrease in vegetation density occurred in one of the Spartina canopies and in the Salicornia canopy, respectively, and led to an expected (but not statistically significant) increase/decrease in wave attenuation. The wider implications of these findings in the context of formeprocess interactions on saltmarshes and their effect on marsh evolution are also discussed.',\n",
       " '## Introduction Recent concern over the possibility of increased flood risk (as a result of rising relative sea level and increased storminess) on many low-lying coasts requires a better understanding of the natural sea-defence capacity of intertidal areas such as mudflats and saltmarshes. Previous studies (e.g. Wayne, 1976;Brampton, 1992;Mo ¨ller et al., 2001;Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2003) have shown that saltmarsh environments in a variety of physical settings can significantly increase attenuation of incident waves compared to unvegetated sand/mudflats. The most recent estimates for macro-tidal northwest European marshes (Mo ¨ller et al., 1999(Mo ¨ller et al., , 2002) ) suggest rates of wave height reduction of up to 50% over the first 10e20 m of vegetated saltmarsh surface',\n",
       " 'Other studies have shown that vegetation can significantly reduce unidirectional tidal marsh surface flows (see e.g. Leonard et al., 1995a,b;Leonard and Reed, 2002).',\n",
       " 'The theory of wave energy dissipation due to viscous boundary layer friction, permeability and the viscous nature of the sea bed in shallow water has been developed in great detail (e.g. Sleath, 1984) since the early works of Putman and Johnson (1949), Bretschneider and Reid (1954) and others. It is known that, over any given surface, wave dissipation varies in response to hydrodynamic conditions, in particular, water depth and incident wave heights. Empirical studies by Le Hir et al. (2000), for example, suggest that relative wave height (i.e. wave height/water depth ratio) provides an overriding control on shallow water wave attenuation. An H rms /h ratio of 0.15 was found to determine the limit of observed wave heights on the Brouage mudflat in France (Le Hir et al., 2000).',\n",
       " \"In addition to these hydrodynamic controls, however, wave attenuation over saltmarsh (as opposed to unvegetated mudflat surfaces) is increased by the effect of bed 'roughness' e the result of topographic variations in marsh surface geometry as well as vegetation canopy geometry and structure (see e.g. Hartnall, 1984;Dijkema, 1987;Pethick, 1992). It has proven difficult to incorporate these sea bed roughness effects into predictive energy dissipation models. A crude attempt was made by Mo ¨ller et al. (1999) to quantify friction by comparing measured wave attenuation on a macro-tidal saltmarsh with modelled attenuation under identical hydrodynamic conditions but over unvegetated surfaces and smooth bottom topography. The resulting friction factors, however, do not allow the effects of topography and vegetation to be separately quantified.\",\n",
       " \"With regard to vegetation-induced roughness effects alone, the studies by Putman and Johnson (1949) and Bretschneider and Reid (1954) made significant attempts to derive a formula for calculating dissipation given known 'friction factors'. Subsequently, attempts have been made at defining vegetationinduced friction empirically, but such attempts have tended to be based on laboratory studies assessing the effect of vegetation on unidirectional flow rather than on the bi-directional flow of wave currents (e.g. Pethick et al., 1990;Fonseca and Cahalan, 1992;Shi et al., 1995;Coops et al., 1996)\",\n",
       " 'These studies have also suggested that the complexity of within-canopy flows results in species-specific flow structures related to canopy height, vegetation structure and plant spacing (Leonard et al., 1995a,b), thus exposing the traditional modelling analogy of regarding vegetation elements as cylinders of varying diameter, spacing and orientation within a flow field (e.g. Eckman et al., 1989) as inadequate.',\n",
       " 'With respect to wave attenuation, the potential effect of spatial and seasonal differences in marsh vegetation canopies has been addressed qualitatively by Mo ¨ller and Spencer (2002), who observed a consistent decrease in attenuation at the marsh edge of the Tillingham marshes, Essex, UK, from autumn (September to December) through winter (December to February) and into spring (March to July). Variations in water depth, however, have also been shown to control wave attenuation at the saltmarsh edge, i.e. the transition from unvegetated sand/mudflat to vegetated marsh (Moeller et al., 1996;Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002), making it difficult to isolate the effect of vegetation-induced surface roughness changes.',\n",
       " 'No study has thus, as yet, systematically investigated the relative importance of different types (and seasonal changes) of vegetation on wave attenuation in a field setting, under comparable hydrodynamic conditions. One of the reasons for this is the very time consuming and error-prone nature of traditional techniques for recording vegetation structure (e.g. the susceptibility of the point quadrat method described by Sutherland (1996) to wind disturbance e a common occurrence in dynamic coastal environments).\\nThis paper thus aims to (a) test and develop a new, easily deployable technique for the quantification of marsh surface vegetation density, height, and structure and (b) investigate the relationship between such marsh surface vegetation characteristics and wave height dissipation (taking into account possible hydrodynamic controls, such as the incident wave height to water depth ratio).',\n",
       " '## Field setting Field measurements were conducted on a macro-tidal saltmarsh near Tillingham on the Dengie Peninsula, Essex, UK (Fig. 1). The Dengie marshes lie between the estuaries of the Blackwater and Crouch on the northern margin of the Thames estuary, southern North Sea and form a generally narrow belt (700 m wide at their greatest extent) between lowlying, seawall-protected agricultural land and intertidal mudflats which extend for up to 4 km offshore. The saltmarshes have been morphologically dynamic over the past 100e150 years with phases of advance and retreat reported in the literature (e.g. Greensmith and Tucker, 1965;Harmsworth and Long, 1986;Pye, 2000). At Tillingham, this morphological history has led to mature marshes that grade into unvegetated mudflats through a distinct shore-normal mud-mound topography',\n",
       " 'Marsh surfaces on the mature marsh are near-horizontal at elevations of 2.4e2.7 m O.D. (Ordnance Datum Newlyn, which approximates to mean sea level). This coast is macro-tidal, with an offshore mean spring tidal range of 4.8 m (Reed, 1988). As other UK East coast marshes, the Dengie marshes are prone to the effect of North Sea storm surges and meteorological influences on tidal water surface elevations can be significant (Steers et al., 1979). Highest wave heights along this coast occur between February and April and between August and October, with minimum values between May and July (Herman, 2000)',\n",
       " 'Further inshore, at the marsh edge at Tillingham, spring tide water depths of between 0.12 and 0.84 m and wave heights of around 20 cm are typically found (as observed over a series of spring tides during a 10-month period (October to August) by Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002).',\n",
       " 'The vegetation is typical of the floristically diverse east coast saltmarshes of the British Isles (Adam, 1988). Midmarsh communities are typified by Limonium vulgare, Puccinellia maritima and Atriplex portulacoides. Near the seaward edge of the vegetated zone, a pioneer/seasonal marsh exists, characterised by Salicornia spp., Spartina anglica, Aster tripolium and Suaeda maritima. The vegetation exists in distinct patches of several square meters in size, dominated by individual species, such that it is possible to identify approximately uniform vegetation types in close proximity to each other (i.e. experiencing similar hydrodynamic conditions).',\n",
       " '## Field instrumentation and measurement Vegetation and wave measurements were carried out at three 10-m long cross-shore transects during two field visits, in September and December 2004. Measurements of hydrodynamic conditions (water depths and waves) were made over three and nine consecutive spring tides, respectively. The timing of the field visits was chosen to coincide with times of the year of contrasting seasonal vegetation cover/structure. Transects differed with respect to vegetation type with Transect 1 containing a dense Spartina cover, Transect 2 a less dense combination of Spartina, Salicornia, and Suaeda, and Transect 3 a uniform Salicornia cover. All transects were located the same distance from the marsh edge and in close vicinity to each other (see Fig. 1) to minimise potential spatial differences in incident wave conditions',\n",
       " 'All transects were characterised by topographically smooth marsh sections such that the effect of topographic variation on wave attenuation across the transects could be assumed to be negligible.',\n",
       " '### Vegetation measurements Field measurements of vegetation were collected at 18 locations (six locations near each of the three transects: three between the wave recording instruments and three in the immediate vicinity (but outside) of the transect) during the September and December field visits. At all 18 locations, digital side-on photographs of a 0.6 m wide and 0.2 m deep strip of vegetation were taken against a red background plate (to provide maximum colour contrast against the brown to green tones of the vegetation). The field methodology was initially developed for saltmarsh environments by Mo ¨ller (2000) and, in parallel, for grasslands by Zehm et al. (2003). Further development has led to the methodology adopted for the purpose of this study, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The method used in this study differed from that of Zehm et al',\n",
       " '(2003) in a number of important respects in order to adapt it to use in saltmarsh environments:',\n",
       " '(1) a rigid plastic (slightly textured) board (matt red colour finish, to reduce reflection and maximise contrast against vegetation) was used as a background to the photograph instead of an opaque cloth (optionally white or black), which was thought to be too sensitive to wind disturbance on exposed saltmarsh environments and would not give sufficient colour contrast in dim light conditions; (2) a smaller area (0.6 m wide and 0.2 m deep) was photographed, as the area used by Zehm et al',\n",
       " '(2003) (1.0 m wide and 0.3 m deep) was thought to be too large (and too deep) for dense saltmarsh vegetation (it would not allow subtle differences in vegetation density to be distinguished); and (3) the vegetation in front of the photographed plot was pressed to the ground with a plastic sheet held within the photographic frame, rather than a tarpaulin (which was found to be inadequate for the more rigid and dense saltmarsh vegetation).',\n",
       " 'Digital images were then classified into binary black (vegetation) and white (background) images using the Erdas Imagine 8.5 image processing software and output as binary matrix files for further quantitative analysis using program routines written in Matlab software code. Image classification included the following key steps:',\n",
       " '(1) cropping of images to standard size of background board and checking resolution of image (1 pixel approximated 0.25 mm 2 ) with reference to object of known size (a scale bar of white and black squares of 1 Â 1 cm clipped to the background board); Following this classification procedure, the binary image analysis in Matlab used a series of programming routines, providing detail on overall image vegetation density (% black versus white pixel cover within the 0.6 Â 0.6 m photographed area) and structure (e.g. canopy height variation across the image). Fig. 3 illustrates the digital image analysis process. Note that the method for determining vegetation canopy height differs from the more traditional methods of determining the height of individual plants in that it provides an average of the height of any vegetation component in the image, measured across the width of the image.',\n",
       " 'To calibrate and validate the digital photographic record described above, vegetation contained in the photographs (i.e. from a surface area of 0.6 Â 0.2 ¼ 0.12 m 2 ) at the locations immediately outside each of the recording transects was also harvested for determination of wet and dry biomass and species composition/structure during the first (i.e. September 2004) field visit. In addition, a separate experiment involved the placement of the photo frame in an area of dense, tall Spartina, which was photographed once with the vegetation cover intact and three subsequent times with the vegetation successively thinned through harvesting individual stems at the base of the frame. Each time the vegetation cover was thinned by partial harvesting, cuttings were placed in a separate bag for return to the laboratory, where samples were dried and weighed to determine the dry biomass that had been removed in the successive clipping stages.',\n",
       " \"### Wave measurements Bottom mounted Druck 'PTX1830' pressure transmitters were deployed at the seaward and landward ends of the three 10-m long cross-shore transects (Fig. 1). Marsh surface topography between each pair of sensors was smooth and the surface elevations of the marsh surface at either end of each transect are comparable (1.06/1.08 m, 1.07/  1.06 m, and 1.04/1  Transect 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Low (1 Hz) and high (4 Hz) frequency pressure measurements were triggered upon submergence of the sensors and stored as (a) 5 min averaged pressure (for water depth measurements) and (b) continuous 4 Hz readings (for computation of wave spectra and summary statistics)\",\n",
       " 'Measurements were controlled and stored, together with a record of datalogger battery voltage and date/time references, via a Campbell Scientific CR10 datalogger. The measurement and data processing method followed the procedure outlined in Mo ¨ller and Spencer (2002).',\n",

The high frequency (4 Hz) pressure time series were then split into series of 2 11 (2048) values (i.e. 8.5 min duration) when water depths reached 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 cm on the rising tide. These high frequency records were processed according to the following sequence:\\n(1) de-trending of pressure time series (using a polynomial fit) to remove any low-frequency tidal component present;',\n",

       " 'A detailed calibration of the above method for wave recording against a video record of water level fluctuations using a calibrated staff is described in Moeller et al. (1996).\\nThis processing sequence thus resulted in wave parameters for the seaward and landward sensors of each of the transects in water depths at 10 cm intervals between 20 and 70 cm depths.',\n",
       " '## Results ### Vegetation measurement The results from the calibration of the digital photograph technique against biomass measurements determined by harvesting the photographed vegetation in the vicinity of the wave recording transects are shown in Fig. 4. The relationship between vegetation pixel density (black pixel density in the classified binary image, i.e. obscuration ratio of the background plate) and dry biomass was positive when all data were included in a regression analysis ( p ¼ 0.05, r 2 > 0.6). The data in Fig. 4a, however, show that the relationship between the vegetation pixel density (black pixel density in the classified binary image) and dry biomass varied between three distinct groups of measurement, namely those made on Transect 2, those on Transect 3, and the separate Spartina thinning experiment',\n",
       " 'With the exception of the measurements obtained from location T1V4, the data from Transect 1 seem to fit into the relationship established for Transect 3. The best fit to the data was achieved with an exponential regression fit. Table 1 summarises the results from the regression analysis performed on these data.',\n",
       " 'The different canopy heights and species composition of the vegetation are shown in Fig. 4b, c. Transect 3 is distinguished by a significantly lower canopy height (across all three locations on Transect 3, the average height was 5.9 AE 2.6 cm) and different species composition (>60% of dry biomass was Salicornia) than Transect 2 (average height across all three locations: 22.5 AE 8.0 cm (although canopy heights on T2V4 were more comparable with Transect 3), >65% dry biomass Spartina). Of the three locations measured on Transect 1, the canopy height on T1V4 was greatest (20.1 AE 7.7 cm) and, given its vegetation composition (74% Spartina by dry weight), this might have put this site more in line with Transect 2 than Transect 3',\n",
       " 'The vegetation at locations T1V5 and T1V6 on Transect 1 (although consisting mainly of Spartina (95 and 87% of dry biomass, respectively)) was much lower in height (11.6 AE 5.6 and 13.6 AE 7.9 cm, respectively), and this appears to have put these measurements more in line with the measurements obtained from the low Salicornia canopy of Transect 3. The Spartina thinning experiment was characterised by the tallest canopy (45.1 AE 4.1 cm) and plots furthest on the right in Fig. 4a, providing evidence for an overriding importance of canopy height on the relationship between %image obscuration ratio and dry biomass.',\n",

The modifications made to the method as outlined above proved successful and allowed its application to coastal environments, where dim light conditions and/or adverse weather (e.g. wind) can be problematic when using the method as configured for grasslands by Zehm et al.

For a larger plot area vegetation density would become too large for differences in aboveground biomass to manifest themselves as differences in image obscuration. Further studies using a larger sample size to further increase confidence in the results as summarised in Fig. 4a are, however, needed.',\n",

       " '### Seasonal vegetation density and canopy structure variations The seasonal change in vegetation density (from September to December) recorded with the digital imaging technique in this study was highly variable between the three transects. When comparing vegetation densities at Tillingham between November, March, and June surveys, previous studies (Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002) observed the highest vegetation densities in November. The observations from the three marsh edge transects presented in this study, however, suggest both increases and decreases in vegetation density from September to December. Such spatial variability is to be expected within marsh edge communities, given the differences in the relative dominance of annual versus perennial species. While annual Salicornia was dominant on Transect 3, where vegetation density decreased significantly between September and December, Spartina dominated Transect 2, where continued growth into the autumn months led to an increase in vegetation density between September and December',\n",
       " 'While Transect 1 was also dominated by Spartina, it appears that it reached its peak density earlier than Transect 2 and thus no significant change in vegetation density was observed between September and December.',\n",
       " \"With respect to canopy structure, the results from this study suggest that it is the mean canopy height, rather than its standard deviation (i.e. canopy 'roughness'), that changes seasonally at the three transects studied: while the mean canopy height decreased from September to December at all three transects, standard deviations (canopy 'roughness') remained constant. In terms of the effect on wave attenuation, it is thus more likely to be the height and density variations of the vegetation layer that explain observed decreases in attenuation in the winter months (as observed by Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002) than changes in the 'roughness' or variability of the top of the canopy.\",\n",
       " '### Relative importance of hydrodynamic conditions and vegetation on wave attenuation Over the short-term individual tidal inundations, a link exists between the surface roughness characteristics of the marsh and the hydrodynamic process of wave transformation across the surface through the effects of friction, percolation, and viscous damping (see e.g. Putman and Johnson, 1949;Bretschneider and Reid, 1954;Sleath, 1984;Le Hir et al., 2000). In addition, however, the wave attenuation process itself is also a function of water depth and incident wave conditions (as higher and longer waves are affected more strongly by the mudflat/saltmarsh surface). In particular, wave heights over shallow mudflat environments have been shown to be limited by critical relative wave height (wave height/water depth) ratios (Le Hir et al., 2000).',\n",
       " 'Previous data obtained at the Tillingham site, however, clearly contained a seasonal signal, not only in terms of both overall energy input (incident wave energy) but also in terms of attenuation patterns (Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002). Seasonally changing surface friction (due to changing vegetation density, structure, or composition) especially in marsh edge environments affected by seasonal vegetation growth (e.g. Salicornia europaea or Suaeda maritima) thus also has to be considered as an explanation for temporally varying wave attenuation.',\n",
       " 'The results of this study agree with previous measurements at Tillingham (Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002) both in terms of significant wave height attenuation observed (around 30% over 10 m) and in terms of seasonal differences (for similar water depths, attenuation was higher in September than December). As measurements were made over three different vegetation transects, however, the results of this study provide some additional insight into the relative importance of wave/water depth conditions and vegetation density/structure on wave attenuation.\\nAlthough it was hoped that incident wave conditions would be comparable between all three cross-shore transects, analysis of the results showed that Transect 3 consistently experienced significant wave heights 2e3 cm lower than those incident upon Transects 2 and 1. This thus allows no direct comparison between Transect 3 and the other two transects.',\n",
       " 'With respect to Transects 1 and 2, however, the results show that wave height attenuation, although highly variable, was consistently greater over Transect 1, in all water depth/ wave height conditions encountered. This difference in attenuation, however, only exceeded 1 standard deviation around the mean in the deeper water conditions (70 cm water depth in September and 50 cm water depth in December (Fig. 6)). Transect 1 contained the greatest proportion of Spartina (Fig. 4c) and was characterised by the highest vegetation density in September 2004 (Fig. 5), which may have led to greater friction and thus greater wave attenuation over this transect at that time of year',\n",
       " 'The average canopy height of Transect 1, however, was less than that of Transect 2 in September and December and its vegetation density was less than that of Transect 2 in December (although not significantly so), so that these vegetation parameters alone do not sufficiently explain the consistently higher wave attenuation. This suggests that vegetation density and height affect wave transformation differently. While the former is a measure of friction as experienced by the horizontal flow components of the wave motion, the latter affects the depth of the boundary layer affected by such friction and thus the vertical component of the wave motion. Furthermore, and possibly more importantly, the physical properties of the vegetation, such as its rigidity or flexibility, may also play a significant role in affecting wave transformations. Further studies investigating the relative differences between individual species with respect to such physical properties are needed to shed further light on this process',\n",
       " 'It must also be recognised that the method for determining canopy height used in this study differs from conventional measurements of vegetation height in that it constitutes an average of the highest parts of any vegetation component present in the digital image (rather than an average of the height of individual plants).',\n",
       " 'Transect 3 was characterised by a very different vegetation type (dominated by the annual, Salicornia (Fig. 4c)). It appears that this explains, at least partly, why this transect experienced less wave height attenuation than the other two transects and experienced seasonal differences in attenuation exceeding AE1 standard deviation around the mean in intermediate (30 and 40 cm) water depths.',\n",
       " 'Variability in attenuation was high, however, and differences in vegetation characteristics between the three transects do not exert a statistically significant influence on wave attenuation. Other controls on wave attenuation must exist and the results of this study suggest that hydrodynamic controls, such as the wave height/water depth ratio, may override any differences in vegetation density/structure in this marsh edge environment. The significant positive relationship between the H s /h ratios and wave height reduction (for conditions where H s /h < 0.55) on Transects 1 and 2 in September and December provides evidence for this. Once H s /h ratios fall below a critical threshold, further decreases in the H s /h ratios are not expected to lead to further reduction in wave attenuation (i.e. water depths become too deep or waves too small for the surface waves to interact with the vegetation canopy on the bed)',\n",
       " 'This critical point, however, had not been reached on Transects 1 and 2 (water depths remained relatively low (<70 cm)). At H s /h ratios above 0.55, however, the relationship between H s /h and wave attenuation also appears to break down. Although only few measurements were made in conditions of H s /h ratios > 0.55, this may indicate that above H s /h ratios of 0.55, the attenuation capacity of the vegetation canopy is reached and further attenuation cannot take place. It is also possible, however, that in conditions of high H s /h ratios, attenuation is affected by dissipation due to wave breaking',\n",
       " 'This is an important observation in the context of the wider morphological evolution of the saltmarsh, as it suggests that this H s /h ratio represents a threshold beyond which the vegetation acts as a significant energy dissipater, thus leading to energy dissipation by wave breaking, bed erosion and/or resuspension of surface sediments. Fig. 7 also shows that, for values of H s /h > 0.55, attenuation may vary greatly, e.g. when an H s /h value of around 0.6 occurred, wave height attenuations of 11 and 34% (Transect 1) and 7 and 33% (Transect 2) were observed. This thus suggests that the H s /h ratio controls the maximum attenuation that can be achieved, rather than allowing actual attenuation to be predicted exactly. Other factors, such as meteorological conditions (e.g',\n",
       " 'local wind direction and speed) will influence wave propagation and breaking processes and thus affect whether the potential maximum attenuation for a given H s /h ratio is reached. Further research into the role of these factors is now needed.',\n",
       " 'On Transect 3, however, no relationship between H s /h ratios and attenuation was present. Given that the vegetation on this transect was substantially shorter (6 cm compared to 15 and 23 cm on Transects 1 and 2, respectively), wave heights were 2e3 cm smaller, and water depths comparable to Transects 1 and 2, this suggests that (a) the canopy height on this transect was too low to allow the vegetation to occupy a large enough proportion of the water column, and/or (b) waves were too small to be affected by the vegetated layer. Furthermore, the different vegetation type (Salicornia instead of Spartina) provides greater flexibility for movement with the flow (i.e. reduced flow resistance)',\n",
       " 'This, together with the significant decrease in vegetation density, may explain why, even in high H s /h conditions of over 0.4 in December, attenuation remained low (<20%) on this transect, while it exceeded 30% on some occasions on the other two transects.',\n",
       " '### Implications for formeprocess interactions and marsh evolution The results presented above provide evidence for a relationship between hydrodynamic controls (i.e. relative wave heights) and different types (Spartina versus Salicornia), heights, and densities of vegetation canopies during individual tidal inundations. In the context of recent concerns regarding the future of saltmarsh systems under scenarios of relative sea-level rise and/or increased storminess (see e.g. French and Reed, 2001) and marsh restoration issues (Williams and Orr, 2002), it is instructive to consider the implications of these results for the longer-term formeprocess interactions at the marsh edge and thus marsh evolution.',\n",
       " 'While, over short, event-based time-scales, the topographic and vegetation characteristics discussed above can be considered invariant, this does not apply over longer (annual to decadal) time-scales, when the hydrodynamic processes themselves exert a feedback effect on marsh vegetation cover and morphology (see also Allen and Duffy, 1998a,b;Allen, 2000;Houwing, 2000). The H s /h threshold of 0.55 identified above as the point when the Spartina canopy appears to reach its maximum attenuation capacity, for example, suggests that, above this value (i.e. in conditions of higher incident wave energy), more energy may be available for sediment resuspension/erosion. Over the longer term (from several springeneap tidal cycles to several years), it is thus the frequency with which such thresholds are exceeded that will determine the morphological evolution of the marsh.',\n",
       " 'Evidence of previous studies does suggest that the evolution of the marshes of Dengie Peninsula has fluctuated between accretion and erosion phases. While the marshes are thought to have formed rapidly between 1870 and 1950, with subsequent progradation rates in the central sections of the Peninsula of 9.7 m a À1 (Pye and French, 1993), subsequent marsh edge retreat of up to 270 m characterised the northern half of the Peninsula (i.e. the area around Tillingham) between 1953 and 1960 (Greensmith and Tucker, 1965;Harmsworth and Long, 1986)',\n",
       " 'The placement of sunken barges to form wavebreakers to the immediate North of the Tillingham marshes in 1984 has had little long-term effect, however, and the characteristic mud-mound topography currently found at the marsh edge is thought to be typical of an eroding marsh (Greensmith and Tucker, 1975). In the central sections of the Peninsula, erosion has been extreme, with ca. 1000 m retreat between 1955 and 1985 (Pye and French, 1993), leading to the development of a ca. 1.5e2.0 m high marsh edge cliff. Once the marsh edge form has altered, the attenuation process changes (e.g. as reflection from the cliff face becomes an important additional process (see also Mo ¨ller and Spencer, 2002 for an investigation of wave attenuation across the cliffed marsh edge))',\n",
       " 'Given the evidence for wave attenuation thresholds presented above, it is possible that changes in the frequency of occurrence of particular wave height/water depth conditions (e.g. events characterised by H s /h ratios >0.55 at the marsh edge) over decadal time periods are indeed responsible for initiating such evolutionary trends. Further research is now necessary, however, to investigate this hypothesis in detail.',\n",
       " '## Conclusion The method of side-on photographs of stands of vegetation as developed in prototype by Mo ¨ller (2000) and, independently, by Zehm et al. (2003) for grasslands, has successfully been applied to marsh edge vegetation stands dominated by Spartina and Salicornia. A positive relationship was found to exist between %image obscuration and dry biomass of the photographed stands, although the nature of this relationship varied with vegetation type and canopy height. The technique provides a time-efficient method for estimating vegetation aboveground biomass and structure e a factor that is important when working in often harsh physical conditions. Furthermore, the technique allows a range of structural vegetation canopy parameters to be objectively quantified. Although this study focuses on vegetation canopy height and its variability only, other parameters such as the vertical and horizontal variation in vegetation density and the presence and size of gaps within the canopy can be quantified',\n",
       " 'It is intended that further analysis of the image data acquired as part of this study will focus on these aspects.

       " \"Through the use of the above vegetation photograph technique, it has been possible to acquire detailed information on vegetation canopy density and height on three 10-m long cross-shore wave recording transects. Wave attenuation over these transects was a function of a combination of hydrodynamic controls (relative wave heights (wave height/water depth ratios)) and vegetation (type, density, and height), although the former may override the latter. For the transects dominated by Spartina canopies, a relationship existed between H s /h ratios and maximum observed wave height attenuation. For H s /h ratios exceeding 0.55, no further increase in the maximum observed wave attenuation appeared to occur, indicating that the maximum 'attenuation potential' had been reached\",\n",
       " 'For the transect characterised by a lower and more flexible Salicornia canopy as well as lower incident wave heights, no such relationship was present, suggesting that water depths and wave heights were too high and low, respectively, for wave heights to be affected by the low canopy at this location.',\n",
       " 'It is possible that, over longer time-scales (>annual), the existence of hydrodynamic thresholds such as the critical H s / h value of 0.55 determined for the Spartina canopies in this study may control transitions from regimes of sediment deposition to erosion (e.g. H s /h values < 0.55 allowing maximum attenuation to occur and thus encouraging sediment deposition/retention on the marsh surface, while conditions of H s /h values > 0.55 may result in excess energy becoming available for sediment erosion/resuspension). While this study is based on a limited data set, the results are consistent with previous studies on wave attenuation and thus justify a call for further research to investigate this hypothesis in more detail.',\n",

       " 'Man-made karst ponds are the only surface water bodies in the Karst region (SW Slovenia, NE Italy) and support variable biotic communities, depending on ecological parameters and human activities. The aim of our study was to establish the relationship between environmental conditions (land-use of the catchment, vegetation of the banktop zone, morphological properties of the ponds, water quality parameters, the presence of fish) and aquatic macrophyte species composition and abundance. The survey of 28 ponds was performed in the peak vegetation period in 2009. The most abundant emergent macrophytes found were Typha latifolia, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Eleocharis palustris agg., and Alisma lanceolatum, while the most common hydrophytes were Lemna minor, Chara spp., Nymphaea alba, and Potamogeton natans',\n",
       " 'About 15% of all species found in ponds are included in the \"Red\" list of endangered plant species of Slovenia. The presence of fish, water transparency, pH, land-use of the pond catchment and quality of shore substrate were detected as the most influential factors determining aquatic macrophyte communities.',\n",
       " '## Introduction Ponds are small lentic ecosystems that permanently or temporarily hold water [1]. They are shallow and their size ranges from a few square metres to several hectares. They can be natural or man-made. Their number is much higher than that of large lakes, which constitute a small percentage of the total number of lakes [2]. Despite this, studies of lentic ecosystems have concentrated mainly on moderately large lakes [2].\\nPonds differ functionally from larger lakes [3], since their littoral structure and its productivity dominates the ecosystem [2]. Despite their small size they contain a significant part of aquatic biodiversity on the landscape scale [4,5]. Humans have created millions of ponds for multiple purposes [2], but today they serve as refugia for a variety of freshwater biota [5] and are, as such, an irreplaceable type of habitat [6][7][8].',\n",
       " 'The biotic communities that develop in ponds depend on environmental conditions and human activity. Several studies document clear associations between the communities and a variety of environmental gradients, such as hydro-period [9,10], surface area [11], and water properties like water transparency, nutrient availability, and pH [12][13][14]. Compared to rivers and lakes, ponds exhibit greater environmental and, consequently, biotic amplitudes [15].',\n",
       " 'Macrophytes are important components of aquatic ecosystems (including ponds), affecting their function through energy flow, nutrient cycling, sedimentation processes, and habitat provision [16,17]. Their presence and abundance reflect the quality of the ecosystem as a whole. Aquatic macrophytes not only are affected by water quality, but they also affect water quality and provide food and refugia for aquatic invertebrates and fish [11,18,19]. Their growth is controlled by a variety of factors, namely water quality, water depth, water movement, substrate characteristics, and biotic interactions [20,21]. Therefore, a survey of aquatic macrophytes is important from the point of view of plant species diversity, as well as of factors explaining the diversity of other groups (e.g. macro-invertebrates, periphyton) [22] and as indicators of water and habitat quality [e.g. [23][24][25][26][27][28]',\n",
       " 'Deterioration of the physical environment and eutrophication of water bodies result in changes in macrophyte distribution, a decline in aquatic macrophyte species richness, and a greater abundance of more resistant species [29].',\n",
       " 'Karst ponds are of human origin, presenting an outstanding natural and cultural heritage [30]. Following mass regulation of rivers and streams all over Europe, man-made systems have become a substitute habitat for numerous organisms [6]. This is the case in the karst ponds, which provide an important network of water-bodies in the Karst Region. The fact, that they are the only surface water-bodies on the Karst Plateau [31] makes them even more important.',\n",
       " 'The aims of our study were to examine the habitat characteristics and/or ecological conditions in karst ponds, as well as surveying the presence and abundance of aquatic macrophyte species. We also aimed to establish the relations between habitat characteristics and aquatic macrophyte species composition. The specific questions addressed were: • Which environmental conditions significantly influence aquatic macrophyte species composition in karst ponds? • How much of the variation of aquatic macrophyte species composition is explained by considered environmental conditions and how do they affect macrophytes species richness?',\n",
       " \"## Materials and Methods ## Study Area Twenty-eight karst ponds were investigated in the Karst region in SW Slovenia. The ponds are distributed on the Karst Plateau along the border with Italy (from 13º38'08'' E, 45º50'43'' N to 13º59'36'' E, 45º39'54'' N) (Table 1). The climate is sub-Mediterranean, annual precipitation is 1,500 mm [32] (about two-fold higher than evapotranspiration). The largest amount of precipitation occurs in November, and the least in the peak of the vegetation period in July [32]. The mean annual temperature is 11ºC [33]. The altitude ranges from 195 to 420 m a.s.l.\",\n",
       " '## Aquatic Macrophyte Survey The abundance of aquatic macrophytes was evaluated using a 5-degree estimation scale [34]:\\nThe whole pond was a sampling unit. Plants were identified using the following keys: Martinčič et al. [35] and Preston [36]. Plants whose reproductive organs were not present at the time of sampling are listed by genus (e.g. Bidens, Epilobium, Sparganium). The survey was performed in July and August in 2009. The nomenclature of ferns and flowering plants follows Martinčič et al. [35]. The definition of aquatic macrophytes is in accordance with Hutchinson [37] and Wetzel [2], therefore woody species and other non-hygrophilous species were excluded from analyses.\\nPlant species richness in the ponds was calculated as species number (N) per surface area and/or approximate volume of the studied water bodies.',\n",
       " '## Assessment of Environmental Conditions Parameters were recorded in the field, measured and/or calculated in the laboratory (Table 2). Independent environmental variables were tested for their significance in shaping aquatic macrophyte species composition. These variables can be classified into three groups [38]: quantitative variables, semiquantitative estimates, and categorical variables. Quantitative variables include morphometric parameters of the specific pond (length, width or diameter (m), surface (m 2 ), depth (m), approximate volume (m 3 ), surface:depth ratio (S/d)), and water quality parameters (pH, temperature (T), conductivity (EC), O 2 concentration, O 2 saturation, transparency, chlorophyll-a). Semiquantitative estimates include habitat characteristics (land-use of the catchment, bottom substrate, shore substrate, type of vegetation in banktop zone, width of woody and/or wetland banktop zone)',\n",
       " 'Categorial variables include data about the presence/absence of: fish, filamentous algae, slime, woody species in the pond.',\n",
       " 'Water samples were taken from each pond in August 2009. The majority of the water quality parameters (pH, O 2 concentration, O 2 saturation, T and EC of water) were measured in situ using the portable multi-meter PCD 650 (Eutech Instruments, Singapore). Water transparency and concentration of chlorophyll-a were analyzed spectrophotometrically in the laboratory on the same day.\\nHabitat characteristics were assessed as semiquantitative estimates in a similar way as in many studies of aquatic ecosystems [39][40][41]. The estimated gradients were as follows:',\n",
       " '## Statistical Analyses Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used for exploratory data analysis. The eigenvalue for the first DCA axis was greater than 0.4 and indicated strong unimodality [42], therefore canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was chosen. Relationships between site conditions and vegetation were analyzed using direct gradient analysis (CCA). Separate CCAs for each environmental variable were performed to test the significance of its influence and the explanation of species composition variation. The analysis was run with scaling for inter-sample distances, and bi-Table 2. Ecological parameters (morphometric and water quality parameters) of the studied karst ponds. 1-7: species-poor \"walled\" ponds with prevailing hydrophytes, 8-22: species-rich ponds with prevailing emergent plants, 23-28: ponds without macrophytes.',\n",
       " 'Pond No. plot scaling to relate gradients in floristic composition to the explanatory variables. Forward selection of explanatory variables was used to provide a ranking of the relative importance of the specific variables and to avoid co-linearity [43]. We used the unrestricted Monte Carlo test with 999 permutations to test the statistical significance of the variables and canonical axes. Another CCA was done with a subset of selected variables only (p<0.1), and the proportions of variance explained by these variables were calculated. Some of the variables were not normally distributed so the data were log transformed. Ordination of the ponds according to the most important environmental parameters was made using CCA. The whole set of analyses was performed using CANOCO 4.5 [44]. Differences in environmental parameters between ponds with and without macrophytes were tested for significance using t-test. Species richness was correlated with environmental parameters using Spearman coefficient in SPSS version 17.',\n",
       " '## Results ## Aquatic Macrophyte Survey Different growth forms of plants were found: submerged hydrophytes, floating hydrophytes, helophytes, marsh species, and flood-meadow species (Table 3). The most abundant aquatic macrophyte species found in karst ponds were: Typha latifolia, Lemna minor, Alisma plantago-aquatica, Eleocharis palustris, Chara spp., Alisma lanceolatum, and Potamogeton natans. Species from the Red List of Slovenia [45] are relatively numerous, constituting 15% of the total of 50 plant species recorded in ponds.',\n",
       " '## Floristically Defined Types of Karst Ponds Leaving aside the smaller group of ponds that contained no aquatic macrophytes, the ordination plot based on results of preliminary DCA showed clustering of the ponds according to floristic composition. Two groups of ponds that were ecologically sound were delineated -a group of seven less similar species-poorer, mostly walled ponds, and the larger group of 15 species-richer ponds with loamy shores.',\n",
       " 'The group of walled ponds was species-poorer and characterized by the presence of different pond-weeds (Potamogeton crispus, P. nodosus, P. natans, P. trichoides) and a higher proportion of other submerged and/or floating hydrophytes, which constitute half of the species. The group of relatively shallow ponds was characterized by a significantly higher total number of plant taxa, with Typha latifolia, Alisma lanceolata, Eleocharis palustris agg., Juncus inflexus, J. effusus, and other emergent macrophytes and marsh species. Emergent species constitute a quarter of all species, hydrophytes only 12%, and marsh species were most common, constituting 36% of the plant taxa.',\n",
       " '## Environmental Conditions and Gradients A preliminary DCA revealed a first gradient length of 6.49 SD, which indicates strong unimodality, so CCA was chosen. Separate CCAs for each environmental variable revealed that some of the variables influence floristic composition significantly: fish presence, water transparency, pH, land-use of the catchment, and shore substrate.\\nAnalysis with forward selection provided a ranking of the relative importance of the specific significant variables (Table 4).',\n",
       " 'The presence of fish, water transparency, pH, land-use of the catchment area of the pond, and shore substrate were revealed to be the most influential factors determining aquatic macrophyte communities, explaining species variation significantly. These variables explain 32% of the total variation of the data set. CCA with these five variables (Table 4) was performed, allowing the distribution of the ponds according to floristic composition along the most important environmental gradients to be shown in an ordination diagram (Fig. 1). Ponds with prevailing hydrophytes are distributed on the upperright side of the diagram in the direction of fish presence (and transparency), which indicates oxic conditions throughout the year in the permanent water phase. Hypoxic conditions normally occur in ponds with a strong input of allochthonous leaf litter in autumn',\n",
       " 'Species-rich ponds with abundant emergent and marsh species are distributed in the lower-left part of the diagram in the direction of finer shore substrate, enabling the growth of the mentioned species. Arrows representing water transparency and land-use indicate relative correlation that was expected, since the higher proportion of forest or permanent grassland in the catchment area of a pond would result in clearer water.',\n",
       " 'Species number was significantly correlated with surface/depth ratio, shore substrate, surface area of the pond and width of littoral zone (Table 5). The ponds with loamy shores and/or wider littoral zone were not only richer in total species number, but also harboured more Red list species, which were also more abundant.',\n",
       " '## Environmental Factors in Different Pond Types\\nThe main differences in environmental conditions between ponds without macrophytes and those with more or less abundant macrophytes, are the type of shore-substrate (p = 0.014) and of bottom-substrate (p = 0.099), as well as the pH of the water (p = 0.078). The mean recorded pH value in ponds without macrophytes was 7.2, while in ponds with plants it was 6.7. The differences were most significant in the case of shore substrate (p < 0.05), which was concrete, or a stone wall in the first case and mostly loamy, or a mixture of stones and loam, in the latter.',\n",
       " '## Discussion ## Floristic Gradients and Environmental Parameters The variation of floristic composition is best explained by the following environmental variables: fish presence/absence, water transparency, pH, land-use of the catchment of the pond, and substrate of the shore. Mentioned parameters explained 32% of the variance in plant species composition that was similar to the results obtained for aquatic macrophytes in karstic watercourses in western Slovenia [46], where a similar set of the studied variables explain 28% of the variation. Capers et al. [13] obtained a similar result (27%), while the results by McElarney et al. [47] revealed higher value (56%). The unexplained variation may also be explained by sampling errors, other non-measured parameters, and by the fact that the species-specific recruitment from the soil seed bank and its persistence has a significant impact on the structure and maintenance of the plant-species diversity in wet habitats [48].',\n",
       " 'Floristic composition was most strongly correlated by fish-presence (7.9% of total variance was explained by this parameter) which, in contrast, had no influence on species richness or the presence of Red List species. A strong role of fish was also found in the study of peri-urban eutrophic ponds by De Backer et al. [14]. Water transparency explained 6.6% of species variance, in accordance with studies showing the importance of submerged macrophytes in maintaining the clear-water state [14,49,50]. The amount of phytoplankton, measured as the concentration of chlorophyll-a, was very variable and did not significantly affect plant species composition or abundance, as was shown by Bakker et al. [51].',\n",
       " 'The number of plant taxa found in 28 karst ponds was 50, which was high compared to the 53 plant taxa found in 9 streams flowing through the agricultural landscape of Eastern Slovenia, and were considered to support rich aquatic macrophyte communities [52]. The percentage of Red List species was relatively high (15%) and similar to results published by Chappuis et al. [53]. Some studies relate the ratio of submerged to emerged macrophyte species with the level of eutrophication [51]. In our study the abundance of helophytes prevailed over that of submerged species. This was not necessarily the consequence of nutrient availability since, in many case, this parameter does not function as a primary factor shaping the aquatic macrophyte community; other factors affecting ecological conditions, such as water depth and fluctuation, could be of greater importance [54]',\n",
       " 'However, if we take into account the aquatic macrophyte indicator values for ponds proposed by Sager and Lachavanne [27], the surveyed ponds were shown to host species indicating a mesotrophic as well as a mesotrophic to eutrophic state.',\n",
       " 'Water pH was expected to have a significant influence on aquatic macrophyte assemblages, as indicated by a study of alpine ponds [12].\\nLand-use practices may affect pond characteristics [5,13,15,55,56], and these changes of the pond environment (e.g. water/sediment quality) may affect aquatic organisms, their species richness, and abundance. Dodson [56] also concluded that land-use was a good predictor of pond biodiversity. In our study, land-use of the catchment of the pond was not significantly correlated with species-richness, but with species composition.',\n",
       " '## Differences in Environmental Factors between Pond Types As expected, the type of shore substrate provided the most significant difference between ponds with and without macrophytes. The semi-natural types of shore, with finely textured substrate (clay, silt and/or loam), were suitable sites (microhabitats) for emergent macrophytes, while in the case of concrete or stony shores, rooted aquatic macrophytes were scarce.\\nThe difference in pH between ponds with macrophytes and \"empty\" ponds also was evident (p = 0.078). The higher pH of the water in non-colonizd ponds could be due to the contribution of Ca-rich concrete and/or stony substrate.',\n",
       " 'Species number did not correlate with depth, but was significantly correlated with size/depth ratio and surface. In the case of alpine lakes [12] depth did not affect biodiversity, while a significant influence of pond size on the aquatic macrophyte community was shown by Bagella et al. [57], who studied Mediterranean temporary ponds. They also established the important role of disturbances. The main disturbances in the ponds studied here are water level fluctuations, since the conditions of ponds in the Karst region depends directly on precipitation [30], which is unequally distributed over the year [32]. In many cases disturbances also could be the consequence of the land-use in the surroundings of the ponds, i.e. trampling, erosion, and invasive species [50]. In our survey invasive alien plant species were not detected in the ponds and were not abundant in the littoral zone',\n",
       " 'The most abundant species was the invasive tree species Robinia pseudacacia, which is widespread in the Karst region and is important from the point of nitrogen enrichment of ponds [58].',\n",
       " 'The ponds with more suitable measures (e.g. loamy shores, wider littoral zone) were not only richer in total species number, but also harbored more Red list species, which also were more abundant. To mitigate adverse effects on plant communities, Akasaka et al. [50] suggests that management should focus on the creation of buffer zones.',\n",
       " '## Conclusions Understanding the environmental conditions that maintain high aquatic macrophyte species richness in karst ponds, together with the main disturbances threatening them, is crucial for the conservation of this important heritage. Land-use in the catchment area and the presence of fish-influenced plant species composition. Concrete shores and bottoms, as well as stony walls, prevented the development of complex aquatic macrophyte communities and the increase of species richness. We conclude that reinforcement of the shores with concrete is the main reason for species impoverishment in karst ponds. On the other hand, some species (Potamogeton crispus, P. nodosus) were found only in walled ponds and that contributes to gamma diversity. As was established for alpine lakes [12], karst ponds need a special approach due to the particular water regime in the Karst area. The present findings should be considered in restoration projects, in order to preserve diversity at all levels.',\n",

       " '# Improving the definition of a coastal habitat: Putting the salt back into saltmarsh\\n## Abstract',\n",
       " \"Definitions of saltmarsh vary, with approaches based on the European Union Water Framework Directive (WFD) and the Habitats Directive differing from major definitions in the literature, and from each other, giving rise to confusion and differing approaches to calculations of extent. Habitats Directive definitions also differ across Europe. This paper's main aim is to derive a detailed definition of the saltmarsh habitat that satisfies the ecological principles of saltmarsh as defined in the literature. This is then related to the Directives by examining each Directive in the context of phytosociology and UK and European Ellenberg Numbers for Salinity. A definition is offered that is precise in vegetational terms and complies with most literature definitions, notably in respect of the importance of halophytes. Although our method has been applied to the UK National Vegetation Classification, the technique can be extended to any vegetation type for which a salt tolerance index is available\",\n",
       " 'Conflation of saltmarsh definition and conservation is reviewed and removed in a way that retains the ability to protect the habitat in its wider context. It is essential that all accounts of saltmarsh, and especially those that quantify extent, specify their terms of reference.',\n",
       " '## Introduction A recent, comprehensive work on saltmarsh notes that \"there is no universally accepted technical definition as to what comprises a saltmarsh\" (Chatters, 2017). A proliferation of habitat classifications and two European Union Directives have led to considerable confusion as to how saltmarsh can be defined, posing problems for comparisons of attributes such as extent. Without defining his terms, Davidson (2018) calculated that the UK supported 34.7% of European saltmarsh, more than any other country, although the largest contiguous saltmarsh was the Wadden Sea (27.6%) extending across three countries. We review the definitions provided by both Directives for the UK and for the Habitats Directive on the Wadden Sea, thus covering 62.3% of European saltmarsh. There is no agreement on spelling, so that multiple online searches are required: there is a choice of saltmarsh, salt marsh or salt-marsh. The first is favoured here',\n",
       " \"Annex I of the Habitats Directive also uses the term 'salt meadow', and some UK sites are referred to as 'saltings'.\",\n",
       " 'Most of the contemporary confusion appears to arise from different approaches by the Habitats Directive and the Water Framework Directive (WFD), with authors of reports associated with the Directives rarely mentioning that alternative definitions of the habitat are available. This lack of precision gives rise to particular confusion when the habitat is quantified, especially where area comparisons are involved. In theory this should not matter so long as saltmarsh is clearly defined but often the definition is vague or missing',\n",
       " 'The scale of the problem is illustrated by the significant difference between statistics for saltmarsh extent submitted on behalf of the UK Government: the UK Office of National Statistics (ONS, 2016) gave a UK saltmarsh area of 44,512 ha while the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) reported an aggregate area of 36,132 ha for the four UK coastal Annex I saltmarshes under Article 17 reporting for the period 2013-2018(JNCC, 2019)), a discrepancy of 8380 ha. Recent figures for saltmarsh area in England are closer: 35,505 ha (Environment Agency, 2022) and 32,462 ha (Natural England and RSPB, 2019), a difference of 3043 ha.',\n",
       " 'When reporting in respect of both Directives, employing Biodiversity Net Gain metrics or (in time) the Greenhouse Gas Inventory, this confusion risks undermining conservation management, so it is essential to alert the audience for such documents to the existence of this ambiguity, and ideally to remove the ambiguity entirely. Habitat mapping and estimations of extent rely on the identification of fixed boundaries within an environmental continuum; for any such system to be effective, a pragmatic approach is required, in turn requiring a high level of knowledge of the habitat(s) involved, especially in respect of their definition.',\n",
       " '## Methods Literature definitions of saltmarsh were examined and common and/ or prominent themes identified, chief of which was that saltmarsh should comprise mainly halophytic (salt-tolerant) intertidal vegetation. Published accounts of saltmarsh by or for the UK conservation agencies were then used to identify vegetation types associated with differences between EU Directives using the UK National Vegetation Classification (Rodwell, 1995(Rodwell, , 2000)). These types were typically associated with more brackish situations or terrestrial transitions. Each vegetation type was then reviewed for halophytic affinity using UK and European Ellenberg Values for salinity (Hill et al., 2004;Tichý et al., 2023) for all species having a constancy of III or more (present in more than 40% of stands)',\n",
       " 'This enabled the identification of halophytic UK vegetation types and from this their European equivalents, and the provision of a precise definition of saltmarsh in terms of vegetation types. The UK approach to the Habitats Directive was then compared to that of the Wadden Sea to evaluate consistency within that Directive.',\n",
       " 'Following convention, original species names used in the names of NVC vegetation types are retained throughout (Rodwell, 1995(Rodwell, , 2000)), but otherwise updated nomenclature is applied, following Stace (2019). Quoted text is retained as originally presented. NVC vegetation types cited here are referred to their European equivalents, based on the EuroVegChecklist (EVC) hierarchical system of Mucina et al. (2016), listing the EVC alliance code and name. This allows our focus on UK saltmarsh vegetation associated with confusion of definitions to be applied more widely, and our use of prominent halophytic vegetation to identify saltmarsh habitat can be employed for any vegetation type provided an index of salt tolerance is available, as is the case for all of Europe (Tichý et al., 2023). It is emphasised that this paper addresses coastal saltmarsh and does not attempt to cover inland saltmarshes.',\n",
       " '## Saltmarsh in the literature Work associated with either of the Directives is excluded from this section. The Oxford English Dictionary (2023) defines salt marsh (sic) as \"Marsh overflowed or flooded by the sea\". The classic sources in the ecological literature are largely helpful. Tansley (1953) describes saltmarsh as \"essentially composed of halophytes\". Chapman (1960) defines saltmarshes as \"areas of land bordering on the sea, more or less covered with vegetation, and subject to periodic inundation by the tide.\" The salinity of the tide and how halophytic the vegetation might be are not included. Beeftink (1977) is more meticulous, stating \"Salt-marsh can be defined as natural or semi-natural halophytic grassland and dwarf brushwood on the alluvial sediments bordering saline water bodies whose water level fluctuates either tidally or non-tidally',\n",
       " 'The salinity of the adjacent water bodies may vary from >38‰ [sic] to 5‰: if the salinity is below 5‰, however, salt-marsh is replaced by reed and rush marshes, willow coppice and tall herbage, etc. … salt-marshes find their upper limit where saline influences are so far reduced that halophytes are in the minority or are totally lacking\". Burd (1989) defined saltmarsh as \"vegetation types described in the draft saltmarsh chapter of the National Vegetation Classification, and previously largely described by Adam (1981), as occurring within tidal limits, although excluding Zostera and Ruppia\". Adam (1981) defined saltmarsh as \"an area in which the vegetation is predominantly phanerogamic (but excluding Zostera spp.) and which is subject to direct tidal influence\"',\n",
       " 'Dijkema (1984) noted that saltmarsh vegetation \"is characterised by its tolerance of the saline conditions and consists of halophytes\". Adam (1990) gave \"areas, vegetated by herbs, grasses or low shrubs, bordering saline water bodies\". Allen (2000) defined saltmarsh as \"areas of land covered chiefly by halophytic vegetation which are regularly flooded by the sea\". Rodwell (2000) noted that \"Communities consisting predominantly or entirely of halophytes can sensibly be termed salt-marsh vegetation types but, towards the upper marsh limit and, in some areas (like the grazed marshes of the north and west of the UK) more extensively, communities consisting mainly or exclusively of glycophytes also occur in the salt-marsh habitat … Deciding whether a particular vegetation type is more closely related to a mainstream salt-marsh community or a predominantly inland community is sometimes very difficult\".',\n",
       " 'Four of the nine definitions cited above supply clarity in specifying \"halophyte\", excluding tidal but non-saline water, or excluding nonhalophytic vegetation such as reeds and rushes, i.e. confining saltmarsh to vegetation subject to saline influence. \\'Saline\\' is defined by the Venice System (Anonymous, 1959) as a salinity above 30, with salinities below 30 regarded as \\'mixohaline\\' (brackish). Two more, those of Burd (1989) and her source (an early draft of Rodwell, 2000), emphasise the role of halophytes but allow for the presence of glycophytes within the vegetation',\n",
       " 'The remaining three, Chapman (1960) and Adam (1981Adam ( , 1990) ) allow for the inclusion of tidal non-saline vegetation but do not actually require it, and such areas tend to occur in the upper parts of estuaries and are not quite \"bordering on the sea\" or \"bordering saline water bodies\" as they describe. Furthermore, geomorphologists (e.g. Bird, 2003;Bartholdy, 2012) tend to define saltmarsh in terms of the vegetation, although of the two only Bird stresses the significance of halophytes.',\n",
       " '## Water Framework Directive saltmarsh Saltmarsh reporting for the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is driven by a need to report on the status of transitional water bodies (estuaries) rather than the saltmarsh habitat per se. The Water Framework Directive -United Kingdom Technical Advisory Group (WFD-UKTAG) (2014) used a combination of metrics addressing extent, zonation and diversity for its environmental reporting tool and required a \"fully functioning saltmarsh\" to \"have all its major zones\". Five zones are defined in respect of England and Wales, and it is suggested that there might be fewer distinct zones in Scotland (Table 1): Scottish saltmarshes often lack a pioneer zone (Burd, 1989;Haynes, 2016), a situation that appears to be entirely natural in origin.',\n",
       " 'Clearly any metric for extent is dependent on the range of vegetation included, but also on the ability to represent this on maps, so that the gradual reduction in the density of Salicornia as the saltmarsh gives way down-shore to sediment flats, requires an arbitrary boundary. Phelan et al. (2011) recommend the mapping of only areas of \"discrete\" pioneer vegetation. Hambidge and Phelan (2014) expanded on the zonation concept, sub-dividing the zones and allocating NVC types to each. Only two Swamp types (S) were listed: S4 Phragmites was allocated to Zone 5 as would be expected, and S21 Scirpus maritimus (Bolboschoenus maritimus) was allocated to High Marsh Zone 4. Phelan et al. (2011) also included S19 Eleocharis palustris and S20 Scirpus lacustris ssp',\n",
       " 'tabernaemontani (Schoenoplectus tabernaemontani), yet defined saltmarsh as \"any discrete marsh, or reed bed, subject to tidal inundation from saline waters\" (italics inserted here). Hill et al. (1999Hill et al. ( , 2004) ) gave Ellenberg values on a scale of 0-9 for a range of environmental attributes, including salt tolerance, slightly modified for the UK. These values represented affinity for salinity and make no direct reference to numerical values of salinity. On this scale, 0 represented intolerance of salinity and 9 represented tolerance of \"extremely saline conditions\". Average European Ellenberg values (using the same scale) were provided by Tichý et al. (2023). These values were applied to the main species associated with the S (Swamp) NVC types included in WFD definitions of saltmarsh (Table 2)',\n",
       " 'Hill et al. (2004) associated a value for salt tolerance of 4 with \"species of salt meadows and upper saltmarsh, mostly subjected to only very occasional tidal inundation (includes species of brackish conditions, i.e. of consistent but low salinity)\", and only species with a value of 4 or above were considered here as halophytic. Their list of species with a value of 4 includes Triglochin maritima and Lysimachia maritima which are regarded as saltmarsh species associated with SM13, SM15 and SM16 NVC types (Rodwell, 2000). An Ellenberg salinity value of 3 applies to \"species most common in coastal sites … that are not obviously salt-affected\".',\n",
       " 'In S19 Eleocharis palustris swamp, only the S19c Agrostis stolonifera sub-community contains species with an Ellenberg value for salinity of 4 or more (both 4, Table 2) but both of these, Triglochin maritima and Lysimachia maritima, have a constancy of only III (present in 41-60% of samples) and the species with maximum constancy in S19 (Eleocharis palustris and Agrostis stolonifera) have very low Ellenberg salinity values (1), so that S19 and even S19c cannot justifiably be regarded as halophytic vegetation',\n",
       " 'In transition from saltmarsh to sand dune, swamp (S) habitat develops in association with the freshwater dune aquifer, with complicated mosaics mingling wet upper saltmarsh (SM19, SM20), swamp (S19c) and wet grassland (MG11, MG13 and occasionally MG12), described by Rodwell (2000) as the influence of salinity being gradually joined by the influence of waterlogging. The only vegetation in Table 2 that appears to qualify as halophytic is S21 Bolboschoenus maritimus swamp, where the nominate species has an Ellenberg salinity value of 4. Although the Juncus gerardii of S21 has a lower constancy and an Ellenberg salinity value of only 3 in the UK, this rises to a more convincing 5.6 in a European context.',\n",
       " 'The statutory nature conservation body Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH, now NatureScot) and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), organisations reporting for the Habitats Directive and WFD respectively, specified that the contractor for their jointly commissioned Scottish Saltmarsh Survey should distinguish between fresh-water reedbeds S4 Phragmites and reedbeds influenced by saline input. Haynes (2016) reported that the task was problematic, as halophytes tended to disappear within 2 m of the edge of the reedbed and devised a method of distinguishing the two types on the basis of adjacent landward vegetation, but also noted that saline influence could extend into reedbeds via excavated channels. Full sea water usually has a salinity of around 34-35, and Chapman (1960) gives the maximum salinity \"tolerated\" by Phragmites as 27.5. Packer et al',\n",
       " '(2017) reported that Phragmites australis becomes stressed at salinities greater than 12 and is killed by salinity exceeding 30, i.e. by saline water. Phragmites australis has a complex osmoregulatory mechanism which can also be influenced by microbial activity around its rhizomes (Borruso et al., 2014). Hill et al. (2004) give Phragmites australis a salinity Ellenberg value of 2, while Tichý et al. (2023) give it a value of 1.6. The highest value recorded by the latter across Europe was 3.0 in France and Italy.',\n",
       " 'Although Phragmites dominates the S4 reedswamp there are subtypes that merit more detailed consideration. Rodwell (1995) listed four sub-communities. Unusually, one of these (S4d) has variants, and one of these (S4dii) often contains two halophytes with UK Ellenberg values of 5: Puccinellia maritima and Tripolium pannonicum, with European values even higher (Table 3). There is thus a variant of S4 reedswamp that merits consideration as saltmarsh, although the variant is unlikely to survive prolonged exposure to full salinity sea water. S4dii contains one species with a European salinity value of 5.6 (Juncus gerardii, Table 3) but is absent from many stands',\n",
       " \"However, given that the nominate species of S4dii and SD4ii, Phragmites australis, has a constancy of V in all types of S4 reedswamp, and is not viable in 'saline' water (salinity above 30) it is difficult to justify the inclusion of any S4 vegetation within the definition of saltmarsh.\",\n",

These types tend to occur at the boundary of saline and brackish vegetation but are extremely rare, are difficult to map or classify in phytosociological terms at their Scottish locations (Haynes, 2016), and their extent is negligible in national (Scottish or UK) terms. Of the vegetation listed in Tables 2 and 3, only S21 yields persuasive evidence of saltmarsh status.',\n",

SM1 and SM2 are seagrasses, and would be excluded by all saltmarsh definitions, but the omission of SM3, SM22-SM24, SM26, and SM28 is more puzzling. Applying the JNCC criteria rigidly would then raise the question of where these other SM vegetation types should sit in terms of Annex I habitat, as well as how S (swamp) types would be allocated. The former issue is addressed here and the latter in the Discussion. The JNCC's Common Standards Monitoring Guidance for saltmarsh (JNCC, 2004) used a definition that embraced all SM vegetation types from SM4 to SM28 but did not extend to any S communities.\",\n",

SM3 Eleocharis parvula is very rare in the UK and has negligible extent. The NVC description for SM3 (Rodwell, 2000) is brief and suggests that this species occurs with a range of associates and in a range of positions on the saltmarsh, so it is difficult to categorise, but the larger of the two Scottish sites, at the head of the Cromarty Firth, is clearly brackish, and there is insufficient evidence to justify including SM3 within saltmarsh. Rodwell (2000) does not give floristic details for SM27 so it could not be included in Table 5, so is addressed in more detail below using additional information.',\n",
       " 'Observations of SM27 Ephemeral salt-marsh vegetation with Sagina maritima on the Dee Estuary, on the NE boundary between England and Wales (Dargie, 2001) and at the Morrich More, at the mouth of the Dornoch Firth in NE Scotland (Dargie, 2017) suggested that this vegetation is not confined to saltmarsh from which turf has been cut or other disturbed areas as Rodwell (2000) described but can occur in the driest upper saltmarsh zone where there is little or no organic strand deposition. At the Morrich More, SM27 occurs at the upper marsh edge in transition to sand dune, and as outliers on transitions to old linear embryo dunes with Elymus junceiformis (SD4) which were left surrounded by saltmarsh as the strandplain prograded seawards until the last two decades (Dargie, 2017)',\n",

At the Scottish site, only two of the ten species listed have an Ellenberg S value (UK and Europe) of 4, with a third species having a European value of 5.4, so that saltmarsh status for SM27 cannot be allocated at the Morrich More. This is possibly explained by location within the tidal profile. At sites on the Dee Estuary where SM27 is associated with disturbed saltmarsh vegetation which it then displaces, it falls within the saltmarsh expanse and is subject to saltmarsh processes. At the Morrich More, the vegetation is within the transitional zone and contains fewer halophytes, conforming to the characteristics of other vegetation at this level in terms of Ellenberg salinity',\n",
       " 'We conclude that SM27 should be allocated to saltmarsh where it occurs within the expanse of halophytic vegetation, but where it occurs near the terrestrial margin, it should be allocated to transition marsh. SM27 is scarce and has restricted area, so this will usually be feasible. Petersen et al. (2014) used a system based on Habitats Directive Annex I habitats to map habitats in the Wadden Sea. Their 1330 Atlantic saltmarsh was divided into 19 categories, including Phragmites swamp, Bolboschoenus swamp, brackish flooded grassland and ruderal vegetation, all of which are excluded from the UK definition of 1330. This classification was used in reporting saltmarsh extent by Esselink et al.

Because the classification is very broad, output from Phase 1 survey has limited application in saltmarsh survey.

Data obligations in respect of the EU Habitats Directive require the employment of EUNIS (European Nature Information System) (Davies et al., 2004), itself based on Annex I of the Habitats Directive and the earlier CORINE system (European Environment Agency, 1994). Accordingly, most of the conservation organisations have compiled detailed concordances for the NVC and EUNIS; the version used by NatureScot has been published (Strachan, 2017). Rodwell et al.

Unless large, complex legends are employed, polygons containing multiple habitats can only be mapped by assigning hierarchies to the vegetation, introducing yet more observer bias. Fourthly, habitats occasionally occur in the 'wrong' place, e.g. relict vegetation. Highly localised circumstances create small areas of other habitats nested within the wider extent.

It has to be conceded that the UK Ellenberg Values for salinity used here (Hill et al., 2004) were reached \"on basis of subjective opinion\", potentially opening to question our exclusion of at least some types of tidal non-saline vegetation. Smart and Scott (2004) recognised bias in Ellenberg values but concluded that individual values were unaffected by this, and that such bias as existed was more likely to be due to errors in environmental measurements.

The zonation element is regarded as important in the WFD approach, yet is absent from the Habitats Directive counterpart, at least as far as definition is concerned. There has been no zonation reporting from Scotland in respect of the WFD, mainly because of the difficulty of allocating zones from existing Scottish datasets. The WFD UK TAG inclusion of Phragmites beds within saltmarsh is problematic in mapping terms due to difficulties distinguishing freshwater reedbeds from brackish ones, but Phragmites swamp also falls outside generally accepted literature definitions of saltmarsh (Tansley, 1953;Beeftink, 1977;Dijkema, 1984;Allen, 2000), which require a saline as well as a tidal element.',\n",

The same argument could also apply to even the variants of S4d that include halophytes because the dominant species of the vegetation types -Phragmites australisis unable to tolerate salinities >30',\n",

The ability to use LiDAR to distinguish the brackish variant S4dii is untested, while overlay of a Highest Astronomical Tide line as a proxy for this is currently precluded at UK level as it has not yet been derived for the Scottish coastline and is in any case too inclusive of freshwater reedswamp and other non-halophytic tidal marsh in Scotland at least. Phelan et al. (2011) experienced difficulty separating fresh water reedbeds from those influenced by higher salinities. Furthermore, although survey methodology is moving increasingly towards Earth Observation (EO), classification of data will remain reliant on a robust and consistent habitat definition.',\n",
       " \"### Habitats Directive The Habitats Directive requires reporting in terms of Favourable Conservation Status, of which extent forms only part. Reporting on structure and function is also mandatory. Here the implementation of the Directive is influenced by its own highly compartmentalised approach, wherein reporting is on the basis of individual Annex I habitats, an approach that even extends to site safeguard, where developers and conservation authorities tend to concentrate almost exclusively on extent. Structure and function operate at a broader level, that of the ecosystem, which in the case of saltmarsh would be most of the estuary or embayment. This would include tidal (but non-saline) marsh and should also include the sediment flat that fronts the saltmarsh and any seagrass beds, as well as consideration of the role played by any coastal defences and nearshore morphology or habitats. Extent is naturally variable, involving exchanges of area between saltmarsh and sediment flat via the 'alternative stable state' (e.g\",\n",
       " 'Silinski et al., 2016). A focus on extent can be additionally problematic, in that once a societal value has been assigned to extent, as in (for example) a Greenhouse Gas Inventory, any diminution of extent is likely to be perceived as a problem, no matter how natural that diminution might be, and any interventionist response aimed at countering loss of extent could result in new problems arising in respect of structure and function. Natural variability of extent thus justifies greater prioritisation of structure and function.',\n",
       " 'If pragmatism is introduced to quantitative reporting of habitat extent, then it is even more essential that informed pragmatism must be applied to the interpretation of data and information derived from such studies. This challenge can be reduced, but not eliminated, by standardising survey and reporting methodologies, but the pragmatic element of survey interpretation can only be standardised so far.',\n",
       " '### Resolving the conflicts It is not unknown for organisations working to the Water Framework Directive and the Habitats Directive to employ different definitions (e.g. Newton et al., 2014) to the extent that mutually exclusive areas or extents might be involved (e.g. Angus, 2016) but at least with transitional waters and saline lagoons, different terminology is employed (transitional waters and estuaries v. Saline lagoons respectively). When agencies employ the same term but apply it differently, as with saltmarsh, confusion is inevitable, and this becomes particularly problematic in the context of quantitative studies. Even when original studies define their terms, subsequent citations often overlook the importance of the scope of the terms.',\n",

Pethick (1992) noted the importance of the entire intertidal profile and cautioned against separating vegetated and unvegetated sediment flats, as did van Regteren et al. (2020). In functional terms the habitat would comprise core saltmarsh + tidal marsh + sediment flats + seagrass beds + nearshore morphology/habitats + other inland transitions + effect of any sheltering sediment ridge + hydrological context -effectively most of the estuary or embayment except for any dune or shingle systems at the estuary mouth that extend beyond a sheltering role.\",\n",

Perched saltmarshes occur in exposed situations, and any halophytic element of the vegetation is established by spray. Perched saltmarshes tend to be small and, although they support saltmarsh vegetation such as SM16 they are arguably not saltmarsh habitat because of the absence of important saltmarsh processes such as tidal inundation and sediment deposition. There is a parallel for this on machair, a coastal grassland confined globally to Scotland and Ireland where depressions in a generally flat vegetation surface support dune slack vegetation but are not structurally or functionally dune slacks (Dargie, 1998;Angus, 2001)',\n",

Where more than one habitat is being mapped, the polygon can be allocated to the habitat better or best represented in the polygon but, if they are equally represented, a value judgement is the only option.

Much of the confusion could be avoided simply by renaming the WFD habitat 'estuarine marsh', which is arguably more accurate and appropriate in any case, given that the estuary is the water body involved.

Annex I of the Habitats Directive compartmentalises the environment, but the wider Directive addresses functionality and context via the concept of Favourable Conservation Status (FCS).

Although confusion can be easily avoided by specifying the terms of \\'saltmarsh\\' in the introduction to all reports and publications where terms are open to more than one interpretation, it might be easier (as well as more accurate) to describe the habitat monitored for WFD as \"estuarine marsh\" rather than \"saltmarsh\"',\n",

       " '# Methane and Carbon Dioxide Fluxes in a Temperate Tidal Salt Marsh: Comparisons Between Plot and Ecosystem Measurements\\n## Abstract\\nTidal wetlands occupy a fraction of terrestrial land cover yet play an important role in global carbon cycling by serving as regional biogeochemical hotspots. The high magnitude of net primary productivity and positioning at the terrestrial-aquatic interface supports open transfers and transformation of energy and mass across system boundaries (Al-Haj & Fulweiler, 2020;Cai, 2011), while biogeochemical conditions of the sediments slows re-oxidation and vertical release of CH 4 and CO 2 (Alongi, 2020;Emery et al., 2021). These features have framed tidal wetlands as key systems for studying effects of changing environmental conditions and increased weather variability. As such, there has been a strong interest in reconciling information derived from different approaches',\n",
       " '## Untitled Section within these ecosystems (Feagin et al., 2020;Holmquist & Windham-Myers, 2022;Trifunovic et al., 2020;Wang et al., 2021), but there are still uncertainties that require further studies to clarify how different techniques and data streams can be utilized for carbon accounting/budgeting purposes, system characterization and improved forecasting capabilities as a result of climate change.',\n",
       " 'Multiple approaches exist to measure CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes to the atmosphere and the chamber based method has been widely used across a wide range of ecosystems (Oertel et al., 2016). This method is well suited for factorial studies where control and experimental plots can easily be distinguished from background noise of the ecosystem or for survey approaches to capture spatial heterogeneity (Czapla et al., 2020b;Villa et al., 2021). Chambers can also be used to acquire direct measurements of respiration, thus better constraining ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary productivity (GPP) estimates from other approaches (Reichstein et al., 2012;Stoy et al., 2006). However, when applied for carbon accounting or modeling, infrequent sampling could present challenges for proper system representation and identifying functional relationships (Cueva et al., 2017)',\n",
       " 'These concerns may be especially relevant for salt marshes where a dynamic range of biogeochemical conditions are modulated by common drivers for wetlands such as light, water level and temperature (Capooci & Vargas, 2022;Huertas et al., 2019;Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021), but also tidal activity and salinity. Furthermore, chambers can only represent a small area (i.e., footprint) of the landscape, capture snapshots in time, and therefore may fail to capture emergent ecosystem properties that can manifest over larger spatial and temporal scales.',\n",
       " 'As an alternative and more modern approach, the eddy covariance technique (EC) allows for near-continuous measurements of mass and energy exchange at ecosystem-scale (Forbrich & Giblin, 2015;Kathilankal et al., 2008;Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021). When paired with temporally aligned ancillary data (e.g., water level, meteorological variables), EC can provide detailed information about ecosystem functionality (Li et al., 2018;Wei et al., 2020). This technique is not without errors, and there are several challenges including loss of data during low turbulence, maintenance requirements, high start-up cost and dedicated site infrastructure which could impose limitations',\n",
       " 'More importantly, EC cannot directly resolve which land cover fractions (i.e., soils, plants, and standing water) are contributing to the overall fluxes as measurements are integrated in respect to both time and space to capture high and low frequency flows (Moncrieff et al., 2005). Additionally, fluxes of GPP and Reco are estimated as a result of a model based on temperature or light (Lasslop et al., 2012;Reichstein et al., 2005), and are not directly measured which introduces additional uncertainties. While both chambers and EC based approaches have their own benefits and limitations, the paired use of methods can be an especially powerful tool for reconciling differences between approaches (Barba et al., 2021;Fox et al., 2008)',\n",
       " 'Specifically, including a data subset with higher spatiotemporal integration from EC (i.e., daily averaged data) can serve as a target benchmark to compare other methods, thus helping to bridge the gap between different measurement scales (e.g., plot-ecosystem) (Hill, Barba, et al., 2021;Lucas-Moffat et al., 2018).',\n",
       " 'Most studies that have made efforts to address differences between EC and chamber measurements have been based within terrestrial ecosystems. These efforts have mainly focused on soil respiration and typically report higher emissions from chambers in comparison with EC measurements (e.g., Barba et al., 2018;Janssens et al., 2000), as attributed to uncertainties in the calculation of ecosystem-scale respiration and limitations in spatial coverage of chamber measurements (Barba et al., 2018;Phillips et al., 2017). Findings are mixed for CH 4 fluxes with studies reporting higher emissions from chambers (Hendriks et al., 2010;Yu et al., 2013) but also higher emissions from EC (Chaichana et al., 2018;Forbrich et al., 2011;You et al., 2021)',\n",
       " 'There are fewer studies which have included GPP and Reco by utilizing opaque and transparent chambers (Lucas-Moffat et al., 2018;Poyda et al., 2017;Riederer et al., 2014). Many of these studies report good agreement when aligning time averaged measurements, yet greater discrepancies or systematic offsets can occur when upscaling or extrapolating measurements to an annual period (Hendriks et al., 2010;Lucas-Moffat et al., 2018;Morin et al., 2017;Wang et al., 2010). While salt marshes are typically homogeneous in vegetation coverage, they are also dynamic, difficult to access and measure, and it is unclear how these measurements differ and complement each other.',\n",
       " 'The current study explores measurements of CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes from plots (i.e., vegetation + sediments), vegetation, sediments and at the ecosystem scale within a temperate tidal salt marsh. A combination of measurement techniques which integrate information at different spatial scales are used to examine component fluxes of CH 4 emissions, NEE, GPP and Reco. We use temporally aligned data to generate representative time periods from EC data to evaluate the level of real-time synchronicity, examine functional relationships to explore driver importance across different measurement techniques and apply empirical upscaling to compare chamber-and EC-derived carbon budgets.',\n",
       " 'We postulate three interrelated hypotheses: We expect an overall good agreement between plot and ecosystem-scale carbon fluxes (H1), as plots are located within a representative area of the EC footprint consisting of homogeneous land cover, but we also expect large uncertainty imposed by tidal cycles and salinity changes. Previous studies examining CO 2 exchange in peatlands (Heikkinen et al., 2002;Lees et al., 2021) and a reed marsh (Acosta et al., 2019) reported lower fluxes from chambers, while studies examining CH 4 emissions have found higher fluxes from chambers in a variety of different wetlands (Chaichana et al., 2018;Hendriks et al., 2010;Meijide et al., 2011;Sun et al., 2013)',\n",
       " 'Only two previous studies have performed similar comparisons in a salt marsh where CH 4 and CO 2 emissions from chambers were found to be 2 times higher than ecosystem-scale fluxes (Krauss et al., 2016), and NEE derived from chambers was of greater magnitude than ecosystem-scale fluxes (Czapla et al., 2020). We expect that functional relationships and environmental drivers will be preserved across techniques but the relative importance of each driver will be different (H2). The underlying assumptions of this hypothesis is critical for justifying the use of chamber-based measurements for model development and parameterization, but there is evidence that functional relationships may be influenced by different techniques in salt marshes (Capooci & Vargas, 2022)',\n",
       " 'Finally, we postulate the null hypothesis that modeled annual fluxes and budgets from plot measurements will agree with measured (NEE, CH 4 ) and partitioned (GPP, Reco) rates from EC (H3). This study provides novelty by systematically combining and comparing flux measurement techniques which integrate information from different spatial scales within a tidal salt marsh.',\n",
       " '## Materials and Methods ### Study Site The study site is the St Jones Reserve (39.09°N, 75.44°W) which has been described extensively elsewhere (Hill, Vázquez-Lule, & Vargas, 2021;Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021). Briefly, the site represents a temperate salt marsh located along the Delaware Bay, with a mean elevation of 0.60 ± 0.26 m relative to NAVD88 datum (McKenna et al., 2018). Vegetation is dominated by a monoculture of short form Spartina alterniflora L. (saltmarsh cordgrass; recently referred to as Sporobolus alterniflorus; Peterson et al., 2014), with patches of tall S. alterniflora, S. cynosuroides and P. australis along creek banks',\n",
       " \"The site is mesohaline and during the year 2020 the average salinity was 8.43 ppt with a range of 0.2-25.0 ppt at the tidal creek. Climate is humid subtropical (Cfa) with a 2020 annual average air temperature and total annual precipitation of 14.1°C and 717.0 mm, respectively. The site is part of the AmeriFlux, Phenocam, and SpectNet networks (Site ID: US-StJ), as well as part of NOAA's National Estuarine Research Reserve System.\",\n",
       " '### Plot-Scale CO 2 and CH 4 Measurements Five 1 m 2 plots were established to perform manual flux measurements across a representative stand of short form Spartina alternifloria L. within the footprint of an eddy covariance tower. We utilized two types of plot-scale chamber designs: (a) semi-transparent cover (90% PAR transmission); and (b) opaque cover (i.e., dark chamber). These chambers incorporate both the sediment and overlying plant canopy within each plot. The frames of the chambers were constructed of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) piping and 6 mm polyethylene; chamber bottoms were fitted with a 19 mm high density neoprene compressible rubber gasket. Measurements from the semi-transparent chambers represent plot-scale NEE; dark chambers represent plot-scale Reco; and the difference between consecutive semi-transparent and dark measurements (i.e., NEE minus Reco) on the same plot represent plot-scale GPP',\n",
       " 'CH 4 fluxes were recorded concurrently with NEE measurements using semi-transparent chambers. Similar chambers are commonly used for greenhouse gas flux measurements to study land-atmosphere interaction (Limmer et al., 2018;Poyda et al., 2017;Tong et al., 2010). These chamber measurements were taken using a closed loop sampling design with chamber air circulated through an ultra-portable greenhouse gas analyzer (LGR; Los Gatos Research, Model 915-0011, San Jose, CA) capable of reading both CH 4 and CO 2 (Limmer et al., 2018). A small fan was used to mix chamber air and closure time was approximately 3 min per frame. To reduce any carry-over impacts from the prior chamber measurement, we first sampled all five plots consecutively with semi-transparent chambers, followed by dark chambers',\n",
       " 'Measurement sets across plots spanned 30 min under clear sky conditions to reduce as much as possible variation in environmental conditions between sets. Sampling campaigns for all measurements were performed twice monthly (approx. 7 days apart) from May to December to capture a variety of conditions including opposing tidal stages (high vs. low water level) and seasonal (phenology) differences. Fluxes were calculated from LGR raw data using either linear or exponential curve fits based on chamber concentration increase during closure time (Pearson et al., 2016;Warner et al., 2018).',\n",
       " 'We removed any cases where the regressions used for estimating fluxes displayed an R 2 < 0.90 (primarily associated with chamber disturbance), with the exception of dormancy measurements where concentration increases were near zero. In these cases, we adjusted our QA/QC criteria to avoid removal of any flux falling within ±0.20 standard deviations of the mean flux (±0.99 μmol CO 2 m -2 s -1 ) (Hill, Barba, et al., 2021). If the QA/QC test was sufficient for CO 2 we made the assumption that micrometeorological conditions of chambers were also valid for CH 4 fluxes (Barba et al., 2021;Capooci et al., 2019). For any given measurement day, we used the average of all five plots and included the standard deviation as a metric of spatial variability across chambers',\n",
       " 'While we did not explicitly test the contributions from different emissions pathways (diffusion vs. ebullution), yet we made extensive efforts to eliminate any physical disturbances (via elevated boardwalks, gentle chamber placement) which could result in artificially forced emission spikes. Natural bubble release processes still likely occurred periodically but the relatively large well-mixed chambers help provide buffering on sudden concentration changes.',\n",
       " '### Leaf-Scale and Sediment Measurements Measurements of net carbon uptake were measured at leaf-scale using the leaf-cuvette of a portable photosynthesis analyzer Licor,Lincoln,NE). Measurements were taken just prior to plot-scale chamber measurements on two separate representative plants located adjacent to each plot (10 plants sampled each campaign). Since we were interested in observing fluxes occurring under current \"real-time\" conditions, readings were performed survey style and the cuvette environment was adjusted to match ambient conditions (incident radiation, CO 2 , humidity) with a flow rate of 500 μmol s -1 . Readings were logged after CO 2 stabilization with an average closure time of 1 min (Hill et al., 2019)',\n",
       " 'Photosynthesis rates were recorded per unit leaf area (as reported by the instrument), but we scaled measurements to plot ground area (1 m 2 ) for cross comparisons by multiplying fluxes by the leaf area index (LAI) of each plot as measured from an Accupar LP-80 ceptometer (Meter Inc, Pullman, WA, USA).',\n",
       " 'Within the bounds of each 1 m 2 plot we installed two (18 cm diameter) PVC sediment collars and used a small opaque closed chamber with an LGR analyzer to measure sediment-atmosphere CH 4 and CO 2 emissions. Total area occupied by the collars was 5.1% of each 1 m 2 plot footprint. Vegetation was excluded within these collars by clipping at the sediment surface which was maintained throughout the study period. Sediment chamber closure time was approximately 2 min and QA/QC procedures were the same as for plot chambers (Capooci & Vargas, 2022).',\n",
       " '### Ecosystem-Scale Eddy Covariance Measurements The eddy covariance technique (Aubinet et al., 2012;Baldocchi, 2003) was used to provide ecosystem-scale measurements on the net exchange of CH 4 and CO 2 . Gas concentration and wind data was collected at 10 Hz from an enclosed path CO 2 /H 2 O infrared gas analyzer Licor,Lincoln,NE,USA), open path CH 4 analyzer (Li-7700, Licor, Lincoln, NE, USA) and 3D sonic anemometer (Gill Windmaster Pro, Gill Instruments, Lymingtonm, UK). The instruments were located approximately 110 m SW of the plots',\n",
       " \"While specific details on tower set-up and pre-processing can be found elsewhere (Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021), we used Eddy Pro software (version 7.0.6) to perform time lag compensation, double coordinate rotation on wind components and Reynold's block averaging to obtain flux data at 30 min intervals. We applied several modified Ameriflux processing steps including filtering of flagged QA/QC values, removal of CO 2 flux outliers (-50 to 50 μmol m -2 s -1 ), incorporation of nighttime storage fluxes and footprint filtering based on Kormann and Meixner (2001) and physical marsh boundaries along the upland terminus. Outliers from CH 4 data were retained as large pulses of CH 4 are possible during ebullition or hydrologically mediated events (Li et al., 2018)\",\n",
       " 'Together, this removed 27% and 23% of half-hourly fluxes for CH 4 and CO 2 , respectively. Gap filling of CH 4 and CO 2 was performed using marginal distribution sampling (MDS) moving look-up tables utilizing variables of latent energy (LE), sensible heat (H), net radiation (Rg), soil temperature (Tsoil), air temperature (Tair) and relative humidity (rH) for CO 2 data and Tsoil, Tair, water level and dissolved oxygen (DO) for CH 4 data (Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021). Partitioning of GPP and Reco from net CO 2 exchange (NEE) (i.e., nighttime method, Reichstein et al., 2005) was performed using the REddyProc R package (Reichstein et al., 2005;Wutzler et al., 2018)',\n",

       " '### Ancillary Data Meteorological data was acquired from an on-site station located approximately 80 m from the eddy covariance tower. Data was collected for air temperature (Tair) and humidity (HC2-S3, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), pressure (Patm) (CS-106, Vaisala, Vantaa, Finland), precipitation (ppt) (TE 525, Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) (SQ-110, quantum sensor, Apogee, Logan, UT). Water quality data was acquired from the main tidal creek which runs adjacent to the eddy covariance tower (10 m). Data was collected for water temperature (Twater), salinity (Sal), dissolved oxygen (DO) and depth (level) from a YSI EXO2 sonde outfitted with EXO sensors',\n",
       " \"We also included information on soil temperature (Tsoil) collected from a separate instrument station located 20 m from plots. The collection of meteorological and water quality data follows the National Estuarine Research Reserve's Centralized Data Management Protocol (Kennish, 2019). Meteorological data can be accessed via the National Estuarine Research Reserve System's Centralized Data Management Office (NERR CDMO; station: delsjmet-p).\",\n",
       " \"### Statistical Analysis #### Representative Time Period Comparisons We calculated representative time periods with 3.5 hr subsets of EC data (i.e., from 7 half-hour measurements) to compare differences between measurement techniques. Vegetation and sediment-atmosphere fluxes, which required less measurement time, were compared using a representative time period of 1.5 hr of EC data (i.e., calculated from 3 half-hour measurements). To organize measurement techniques and the data generated from each, we applied a naming convention where Plot exp , Leaf exp , Sediment exp and EC exp , are the collective measurement sets from plot chambers, plot vegetation, sediment chambers and the representative eddy covariance time periods, respectively. The means from these subsets were compared with either a Welch's t-test or a Wilcox signed-rank test dependent upon normality confirmation (Shapiro-Wilks)\",\n",
       " 'The plot subsets (Plot exp , Leaf exp , Sediment exp ) were also compared to the ecosystem subset (EC exp ) by linear regression to ascertain cross-scale relationships.',\n",
       " '#### Functional Relationships and Statistical Modeling To determine the strength of key functional relationships across measurement techniques, we first took a standardized approach and assembled simple regression models. All variables which were selected for the subsequent multivariate models were used to test bivariate relationships (linear vs. exponential) at each measurement level (Plot exp , Leaf exp , Sediment exp , EC exp and EC dd ) for each relevant flux component (NEE, GPP, Reco and CH 4 ).',\n",
       " 'To explore driver importance more thoroughly, we then took a multivariate approach by assembling generalized least squares (GLS) statistical models at each measurement level (Plot exp , Leaf exp , Sediment exp , EC exp and EC dd ). We also added a higher hierarchical level of data consisting of daily daytime averaged EC measurements (EC dd ), covering the period chambers were deployed (May to December, n = 244) to represent a more complete time-integrated system. Models were generated for each flux component to obtain relevant drivers and response strengths (nlme R package; Pinheiro et al., 2017). Independent variable distributions were inspected for normality (Shapiro-Wilks) and skewness (moments R package; Komsta & Novomestky, 2015). Log and square-root transformations were performed on CH 4 and CO 2 emissions to adjust for right-skewed data',\n",
       " 'If the transformation generated negative values (as with Reco), a constant was added prior to transforming to set all values positive. All potential driver variables were scaled by setting a zero mean with a one unit standard deviation to allow cross model coefficient comparison. Temporal autocorrelations were accounted for between concurrent days or measurement sets (approx. 7 days apart).',\n",
       " 'We initially considered all ancillary drivers including full meteorology and water quality data. Saturated models were inspected for variance inflation factor (VIF) and any variable with a VIF >3 was removed from the analysis. This mainly occurred with highly auto-correlated variables such as soil, water and air temperature. In such cases we looked at the bivariate correlation analysis and selected the driver with the best fit. The resulting variable sets were run through a dredging function which included any ecologically relevant combination of first-order interactions (MuMIn R package; Barton & Barton, 2015). All possible variable combinations were evaluated and ranked by minimal Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Final models were chosen based on a parsimonious approach (lowest AIC with the least number of interactions).',\n",
       " '#### Upscaling of Plot Chamber Fluxes To examine the potential of plot measurements for upscaling applications we applied the multivariate statistical models parameterized from plot data in a predictive framework. Specifically, we left variables with similar magnitudes and ranges unscaled and applied the plot model parameters to predict fluxes using the relevant independent variables. For CH 4 and Reco emission models, where we adjusted the dependent variables, coefficients were back-transformed. Prediction uncertainty was estimated with a 95% confidence interval applied to coefficients. Daily daytime ancillary data was used in upscaling models for prediction of a daily daytime average flux rate. Likewise, the daily daytime averaged eddy covariance flux rates were used as a comparison benchmark. To arrive at annual sums from plots, we calculated the number of daytime half-hour periods each day (PAR > 20 µmols), converted predicted flux rates to half-hourly sums and multiplied by the number of daily daytime half-hour periods.',\n",

This was more apparent for minimum temperatures where both sediment and tidal water remained 4.5°C and 5.5°C higher than the lowest mean daily air temperature (-4.0°C), respectively. In contrast, sediment temperatures reached a daily maximum 6 days earlier than air temperature while water temperatures peaked 15 days later (29 July).

Leaf-scale measurements showed a steady decline in photosynthetic efficiency over time but when accounting for plot leaf area, rates exceeded EC-derived GPP well into dormancy phenophase. Emissions of CH 4 and CO 2 directly from sediments were more variable compared to plot chambers, yet agreement between measurement techniques was also linked to canopy phenological stages. Our second set of hypotheses (H2, H3), regarding functional relationships, environmental drivers and temporal upscaling between measurement techniques was only partially supported',\n",

Many studies have reported that tidal wetlands act as net carbon sinks as low as -901 g C m -2 yr -1 from a native Phragmites marsh (Huang et al., 2020) or net carbon sources as high as 984 g C m -2 yr -1 from a restored urban marsh (Schafer et al., 2014)',\n",

(2018) (17.6 g C m -2 yr -1 ) where both the salinity range (0-25 ppt) and species dominance (S. alterniflora) coincide with our site.',\n",
       " '### Plot-Scale Fluxes Studies applying plot-scale measurements within tidal wetlands are scarce due to challenges of the environment including tidal cycles. We propose that it is critical to consider a broad suite of environmental conditions when applying chamber-based measurements to estimate carbon budgets or for account ing applications as tides can have a strong influence on gas exchange (Huang et al., 2020;Wei et al., 2020). Several studies have found a variable response of NEE to tides highlighting the importance of site-specific conditions (Guo et al., 2009;Knox et al., 2018;Nahrawi et al., 2020)',\n",
       " 'We found that NEE was 19.3% lower (more negative) when considering only high tide days which could be attributed to a suppression of Reco via the water barrier that limits oxygen diffusion to sediments, promoting less metabolically favorable conditions (Seyfferth et al., 2020), while directly impeding atmospheric emissions (Emery et al., 2021;Huang et al., 2020). Toxic metabolites could also be more readily flushed from the rhizosphere or terminal electron acceptors replenished (sulfide → sulfate), possibly reducing vegetation stress (Forbrich & Giblin, 2015;Guo et al., 2009;Pezeshki, 2001).',\n",
       " 'The overall mean plot-scale Reco (4.6 μmol m -2 s -1 ) fell within the range (4.2-5.8 μmol m -2 s -1 ) reported by two previous canopy chamber studies from S. alternifloria marshes (Xu et al., 2014;Yang et al., 2018). That said, our measurements were considerably higher than those at another US East Coast site (approximately 523 km away), where Reco was nearly balanced with GPP for plots located within the marsh interior (net exchange of 5.0 g C m -2 yr -1 ) (Czapla et al., 2020b). These differences are likely driven by tidal range relative to platform height as our site has a greater mean elevation (0.6 m vs. -0.04 m) and range (1.7 vs. 0.83 m) than Czapla et al',\n",

Our mean rate was still 334%-487% higher than several S',\n",
       " 'alterniflora marshes and emissions were considerably more seasonal with maximum rates developing during late maturity and senescence (Czapla et al., 2020b;Geoghegan et al., 2018;Xu et al., 2014), potentially indicating that freshly degraded plant compounds are providing an electron source for non-competitive methylotrophic methanogenesis (Seyfferth et al., 2020).',\n",
       " '### Plot to Ecosystem-Scale Comparisons At plot-scale, components related to plant activity (NEE and GPP) had the best overall agreement with ecosystem-scale fluxes (R 2 = 0.84-0.95) and the fewest number of differences among pairwise comparisons. Over 66% of the integrated EC footprint is associated with short form S. alterniflora (Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021), which helps constrain possible explanations for discrepancies across measurement techniques. NEE and GPP are also reliant on physiological properties of vegetation and are associated with slower environmental response (e.g., stomatal conductance and photosynthetic capacity) which helps constrain any abrupt variability of fluxes and there is less influence from physical forcings such as pressure and water level (Villa et al., 2021), which could further contribute to the higher level of agreement with these components.',\n",
       " 'Plot-scale carbon emissions (i.e., Reco and CH 4 fluxes) also had good agreement with ecosystem fluxes (R 2 = 0.74-0.95), yet the level of agreement between pairwise comparisons was dependent on phenology. We postulate a combination of physical and biogeochemical differences across the marsh where chambers are located and the broader ecosystem as possible explanations driving these discrepancies. First, EC measurements integrate tidal channels and flanking vegetation associated with higher biomass, larger culms and deeper rooting depth which likely leads to greater CO 2 respiratory costs from increased canopy shading late in the growing season (Dingkuhn et al., 1990). This also likely drives heterogeneous methane production and emissions via increased photoassimilate transport and plant mediated pathways (Seyfferth et al., 2020). Second, tidal waters remain warmer than sediment and air temperatures later into dormancy which could cause increased heterogeneity in sediment respiration rates',\n",
       " 'Third, since higher biomass correlates with increased sediment deposition in tidal systems (Kirwan & Megonigal, 2013;Kirwan et al., 2016), and sediments in this zone are found to have courser textures (Seyfferth et al., 2020), it is likely that tidal cycling increases the potential for allochthonous carbon and nutrient deposition, providing additional substrates for the microbiome (Czapla et al., 2020a). Lastly, the range and depth of tidal flow may not be consistent across seasons. When looking at monthly average water levels during the study, we find that under daytime conditions when chambers were deployed, water levels were 70% higher from September-December (0.34 m) than from May to August (0.20 m) which could have suppressed emissions from interior region relative to higher elevation levees where sediments remain more oxygenated (Kostka et al., 2002).',\n",
       " 'We found that maximum emissions from chambers were 80% and 24% lower than CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes measured by EC. This was in opposition to findings of Krauss et al. (2016) where respiratory CH 4 and CO 2 emissions were compared over 5 sampling periods at a brackish Gulf Coast marsh populated by S. patens. Although pairwise comparisons with representative time periods from EC were not explicitly tested, maximum emissions recorded from chambers were 317% and 44% higher than CH 4 and CO 2 fluxes measured by EC, respectively. One contrasting feature is the limited microtidal range and sediment supply of Gulf Coast marshes (Holmquist et al., 2021). This acts to restrict deposition and levee development resulting primarily in vegetated flats or areas of open water which persistently occupies a higher proportion of the total area',\n",
       " 'Thus, while the plot-scale fluxes were likely representative of contributions from vegetated flats, considerable areas of open water and tidal creeks were also integrated with EC where fluxes are likely lower or masked by lateral transport across system boundaries (Cai, 2011;Trifunovic et al., 2020).',\n",
       " '### Bivariate Functional Relationships Strong functional relationships for NEE and GPP were established with each measurement technique but with greater spatiotemporal integration (EC dd ), the effect of temperature weakened while the importance of other drivers increased. This highlights the dynamic nature of tidal wetlands as tidal cycles can cause a dynamic co-variation and confounding effects among water level, salinity and dissolved oxygen (Abdul-Aziz et al., 2018;Moffett & Gorelick, 2016;Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021), which can manifest at a variety of temporal scales (Knox et al., 2018). In many cases, plot-scale measurements only provide a snapshot within the diurnal cycle, which in our case still provided strong bi-variate relationships with variables having stronger seasonal linkages (i.e., temperature) but failed to capture the importance of variables having a stronger diurnal linkage (i.e., PAR).',\n",
       " 'Relationships established for Reco were also similar across scales, but the overwhelming effect of temperature was preserved even with a higher level of data coverage. While temperature is important, Reco values derived from our EC measurements are generated from a model using temperature (nighttime method) (Reichstein et al., 2005). That said, there is direct evidence that temperature is a very strong driver of sediment respiration at this site (Capooci & Vargas, 2022). We recognize that nighttime Reco is not the same as nighttime sediment respiration (Barba et al., 2019), but also incorporates vegetation which supports the larger disconnections found between sediment emissions derived from sediment chambers (R 2 = 0.73) and plot-scale Reco derived from plot chambers (R 2 = 0.88).',\n",
       " 'Our results show that functional relationships for CH 4 fluxes are complex. While temperature is important, its effect is bi-directional, promoting both increased production and oxidation (Morin et al., 2014;Rey-Sanchez et al., 2018), which can confound the overall response when analyzed throughout a year. When applying daily daytime data, we found the negative influence of dissolved oxygen explained more variability than any other driver (R 2 = 0.44). Since dissolved oxygen oscillates seasonally with highest levels during dormancy when CH 4 fluxes are lowest, this could be causing another spurious correlation, albeit a biologically expected relationship as higher dissolved oxygen promotes CH 4 oxidation and reduces atmospheric CH 4 emissions (Trifunovic et al., 2020). Supporting this are findings from a freshwater study where temperature was a less important regulator of oxidation compared to dissolved oxygen (Thottathil et al., 2019)',\n",
       " 'Despite the importance of salinity as a negative control on CH 4 emissions reported by many studies (Al-Haj & Fulweiler, 2020;Krauss et al., 2016;Tong et al., 2010), we found no significant relationship using data from chambers or EC despite levels up to 18.5 ppt and half-hourly levels up to 23.4 ppt. These salinity values place our site on the upper echelon of the widely accepted salinity/CH 4 limitation threshold (Poffenbarger et al., 2011), but it has been proposed that CH 4 production in our site is driven by noncompetitive methylotrophic methanogenesis (Seyfferth et al., 2020) which challenges the current paradigm of CH 4 production limitation driven by salinity gradients.',\n",
       " '### Statistical Modeling Across Measurement Techniques The use of bivariate relationships provides a standardized way to examine how the response of individual variables changes across measurement techniques. However, within a complex system important variable dependencies and interactions can arise, thus multivariate models can help reveal additional information about each measurement technique and the associated data. Temperature was still the overwhelming factor regardless of measurement techniques but additional drivers were identified. For plot-scale data, VPD was a negative driver of plot CH 4 emission yet promoted carbon uptake (GPP). This effect is likely linked to stomatal conductance and dissolved methane in the transpiration stream (Megonigal & Guenther, 2008;Mitra et al., 2020), while CO 2 uptake rates are somewhat promoted due to high concentrations of CO 2 in bundle-sheath cells of Spartina vegetation (C4 pathway) which could temporarily increase water use efficiency when conductance becomes limited (Ye et al., 2020)',\n",
       " 'Water level was a negative driver of both sediment Reco and CH 4 , indicating physically slowed rates of sediment-atmosphere diffusion when sediments become saturated (Emery et al., 2021;Li et al., 2018).',\n",
       " 'When applying representative time periods from EC which aligned with the timing of plot measurements, higher water levels promoted carbon uptake (more negative NEE and GPP) and suppressed CH 4 emissions which is in-line with a previous site study (Vazquez-Lule & Vargas, 2021). Adding to the previous findings, we attribute this response to several factors including tidal range, site geomorphology, sediment biogeochemistry and platform elevation which at our site, limits any significant inundation of vegetation that would temporarily reduce photosynthetic leaf area yet sediments still become regularly flooded (Hill, Vázquez-Lule, & Vargas, 2021). This can provide a flushing effect to interior sediments where sulfides limit plant growth (Lamers et al., 2013), while temporarily suppressing emissions (Emery et al., 2021)',\n",
       " 'Likewise, persistently saturated conditions and low Eh values in interior sediments promotes a methanogenic environment resulting in large subsurface CH 4 pools (Seyfferth et al., 2020), where emissions become highly regulated by hydrological controls. In fact, many wetland studies finding opposing patterns, were dominated by P. australis stands which can greatly increase plant mediated emissions, thus by-passing any water barriers (Liu et al., 2019;Olsson et al., 2015), or only experienced seasonal flooding (Knox et al., 2021). Further supporting this line of evidence are findings from Huang et al. (2019) that air exposed sediments had greater emissions during high tide season compared to low tide season when sediments are less frequently flooded.',\n",
       " 'When applying the higher level of EC data which integrates all daytime measurements (EC dd ), there were numerous interaction terms and sub-daily water level oscillations were no longer significant for any flux component. Despite this, tidally regulated salinity and dissolved oxygen were significant interactive variables for NEE and CH 4 , likely exerting influence on terminal electron replenishment and methane oxidation rates (Pezeshki, 2001;Tobias & Neubauer, 2019). Further, VPD and PAR were significant interactive variables regulating NEE and GPP, likely exerting influence on stomatal conductance and rates of photosynthesis (Kathilankal et al., 2011). Consistent with bivariate functional relationships, the regulation of CH 4 flux by dissolved oxygen remained equally important as temperature.',\n",
       " '### Implications and Considerations to Reconcile Measurement Approaches Each measurement technique which we included has a set of best use applications but also limitations (Figure 6). This is primarily tied to the amount of spatial and temporal data integration but also technical factors, ease of implementation and cost. Plot chamber derived fluxes which incorporate both sediments and the full plant canopy can provide an accurate snapshot of ecosystem fluxes, offer direct measurements of GPP and Reco and targeted fluxes from sediments and vegetation can provide detailed information about contributing processes. While chambers could be more feasible for manipulation studies, chamber surveys can typically identify the strongest/most relevant drivers and improved monitoring for detailed system characterization or budgets could also be possible with automation (Hill, Barba, et al., 2021)',\n",
       " 'Despite these applications, chamber based methods have a restrictive sampling footprint, are labor intensive with strict sampling protocols, can be sensitive to pulses or hotspots and may fail to capture emergent properties of the larger system. Eddy covariance derived fluxes are more fully integrated across the whole ecosystem and while there are still challenges for data inclusion during periods of low turbulence or storm events, collection is possible over longer intervals which provides better information for characterization or annual budgets. Often the limitation of one method is complemented by the strength of another. While the use of a specific method is largely dependent upon research goals and available resources, combining multiple techniques can provide a powerful way to understand multi-level system dynamics.',\n",
       " 'Within tidal wetlands, when applying chamber methods for ecosystem-scale metrics, we advocate for larger chambers when possible which are able integrate a larger footprint that helps reduce flux variability or pulse effects. This approach can be paired with targeted measurements of sediment and vegetation to fully understand the contributing fluxes integrated within the chamber. When running an eddy covariance system, we advocate for periodic chamber field surveys for sanity checks, constraining the magnitude of partitioned fluxes (GPP, Reco) and for assessing contributions to ecosystem level fluxes.',\n",
       " '## Conclusions We systematically compared measurement techniques which integrate information across different spatial and temporal scales within a temperate salt marsh. This approach was helpful to understand the potential applications and limitations of each technique while combining techniques allowed for more information on system functionality. When placing chambers within the representative EC footprint, we found good overall agreement between paired plot chambers and EC. We generally saw that agreement was more consistent for NEE and GPP and decreased for CH 4 and Reco emission components during senescence and dormancy, supporting the idea of more biological activity associated with tidal creeks/levees that only EC was able to integrate at ecosystem-scale. We found it was important to include a variety of conditions including variable water levels for chamber measurements, as the magnitude of emission fluxes was reduced with elevated water levels',\n",
       " 'Bivariate functional relationships provided evidence that the influence of drivers was dependent on the scale of the measurement and multivariate statistical modeling revealed that while the system was characterized well at plot-scale (mainly via temperature), including a more comprehensive data set (EC exp and EC dd ) revealed higher system complexities. Applying empirical upscaling models from plot measurements resulted in overpredictions of NEE and GPP and underpredictions of CH 4 and Reco emissions which indicates that periodic chamber measurements underestimate the complexity of a dynamic system. Our findings ultimately support the need for continuous monitoring within these ecosystems as limited data coverage can lead to omissions of important secondary drivers and variable interactions which can generate greater uncertainty or errors when solely utilizing chamber based data.',\n",

       " 'We used a comparative data set for 25 lakes in Denmark sampled during summer to explore the influence of lake morphometry, catchment conditions, light availability and nutrient input on lake metabolism',\n",
       " 'We found that (1) gross primary production (GPP) and community respiration (R) decline with lake area, water depth and drainage ratio, and increase with algal biomass (Chl), dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total phosphorus (TP);(2) all lakes, especially small with less incident light, and forest lakes with high DOC, have negative net ecosystem production (NEP \\\\ 0); (3) daily variability of GPP decreases with lake area and water depth as a consequence of lower input of nutrients and organic matter per unit water volume; (4) the influence of benthic processes on free water metabolic measures declines with increasing lake size; and (5) with increasing lake size, lake metabolism decreases significantly per unit water volume, while depth integrated areal rates remain more constant due to a combination of increased light and nutrient limitation',\n",
       " 'Overall, these meta-parameters have as many significant but usually weaker relationships to whole-lake and benthic metabolism as have TP, Chl and DOC that are directly linked to photosynthesis and respiration. Combining water depth and Chl to predict GPP, and water depth and DOC to predict R, lead to stronger multiple regression models accounting for 57-63% of the variability of metabolism among the 25 lakes. It is therefore important to consider differences in lake morphometry and catchment conditions when comparing metabolic responses of lakes to human impacts.',\n",
       " '## Introduction Research on lake metabolism has shown that gross primary production (GPP), respiration (R) and net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP -R) vary considerably among lakes and over time within lakes (Cole et al. 2000;Hanson et al. 2006;Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007;Staehr et al. 2010a). Many lakes have a negative NEP and most release CO 2 to the atmosphere. This is due to the considerable supply and substantial degradation of allochthonous organic material from the surrounding landscape (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007Staehr , 2009)). While day-to-day differences in metabolism within a lake are primarily driven by changes in light, temperature and vertical mixing (Hanson et al',\n",
       " '2006;Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007), long-term differences in metabolism between lakes are strongly related to changes in concentrations of total phosphorus (TP), phytoplankton chlorophyll (Chl) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (Sand-Jensen andStaehr 2007, 2009). Thus, autotrophic lakes (NEP [ 0) typically have high TP, high Chl and low DOC concentrations, whereas the most heterotrophic lakes have low TP, low Chl and high DOC (Hanson et al. 2003;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007).',\n",
       " 'Lake morphometry (surface area and depth), catchment properties (geology, size and land use) and hydrology have a strong influence on lake temperature, physical mixing, nutrient concentrations, DOC, Chl and transparency (Fee et al. 1996;Hanson et al. 2007;No ˜ges 2009), suggesting that these conditions operate as meta-parameters with an indirect but potentially strong effect on lake metabolism. Implicit scaling of lake productivity to lake size has been considered for decades (Thienemann 1927;Brylinsky and Mann 1973;Fee et al. 1992), and location in forests or open landscapes is also known to affect metabolism (Tranvik 1992;del Giorgio and Peters 1994;Sand-Jensen andStaehr 2007, 2009)',\n",
       " 'Thus, lake area is statistically positively related to wind exposure, water depth and mixing depth and inversely related to external input of nutrients and DOC per water volume and surface area (e.g., Brylinsky and Mann 1973;Duarte and Kalff 1989;Fee et al. 1996). Drainage ratio (catchment area:lake area) is positively related to external input of nutrients, CO 2 and DOC (Gergel et al. 1999). Forest cover is negatively correlated with nutrient input and incoming irradiance for small lakes and positively correlated with DOC input and light attenuation by coloured DOC (Xenopoulos et al. 2003;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007).',\n",
       " 'In contrast to the substantial literature on the importance of meta-parameters for lake chemistry and physics, there are few comparative measurements of whole-lake metabolism, for a sufficiently large number of lakes, to evaluate the importance of lake size and catchment conditions on whole-lake metabolism and atmospheric CO 2 exchange. This study investigates the effect of these meta-parameters on GPP, R and NEP, and compares their role with that of traditional direct drivers of metabolism (i.e., Chl, DOC, light and temperature). Our general expectation is that meta-parameters are significant though probably not as strong predictors of GPP, R and NEP as the intrinsic variables directly involved in metabolic processes. If so, more general predictive models can be derived and new understanding of control mechanisms can be obtained.',\n",
       " 'Our first specific prediction is that both volumetric GPP and R should decline with increasing lake area, water depth and drainage ratio, as the concentrations and input of nutrients and DOC decrease (No ˜ges 2009). Although light availability decreases with increasing depth of the photic zone, light availability, is, however, expected to be similar across lake sizes as lower inputs of light absorbing material and greater mixing depth in larger lakes should cause mean light availability to remain similar among lakes of different sizes. Areal rates of GPP integrated over the entire water column is therefore expected to vary little with lake size, and the influence of lake size for GPP expected to be higher for volume specific rates.',\n",
       " 'Our second specific prediction is that small lakes should have higher DOC input and concentrations and be more net heterotrophic (NEP \\\\ 0) than large lakes and that forest lakes should be more net heterotrophic than lakes in open landscapes. Small lakes have a greater contact and possibility of exchange of organic material with the terrestrial landscape along its periphery relative to lake surface area than large lakes. Forest lakes have a direct transfer of litter from the surrounding tree vegetation, receive less light for photosynthesis on the lake surface and have higher DOC concentrations in the water column competing with photosynthetic pigments for available photons causing mean light availability to remain low despite of a shallow mixed depth (Staehr et al. 2010a). Conversely, reduced input of DOC in larger lakes should favour positive NEP as mean light availability for primary production is the same but less allochthonous material is supplied for bacterial oxygen consumption',\n",
       " 'A final mechanism may restrict benthic photosynthesis relative to respiration in small forest lakes, namely the typical organic-rich sediments of flocculated humic material of low mass density that is physically instable for microalgae and unfavourable for growth of rooted plants (Barko and Smart 1986;Sand-Jensen et al. 2005).',\n",
       " 'Our third specific prediction is that the contribution of benthic processes to whole-lake metabolism declines with increasing water depth. Because light penetration to sediments decreases with water depth, the benthic primary production should be more constrained by water depth than respiration and this should be particularly so in forest lakes with high DOC concentrations and poor light conditions. To the extent that lake depth and lake area are correlated, the role of benthic processes should also decline with increasing lake area, while surrounding forest vegetation may stimulate benthic R but impede GPP and NEP.',\n",
       " 'Our fourth specific prediction is that the day-to-day variability of lake metabolism should decline with increasing lake area and depth. Measurements of wholelake metabolism were performed over 1 week in each lake for subsequent comparison among all 25 lakes. This duration permits reliable calculations of mean daily metabolism and mean values for other physical, chemical and biological properties (Hanson et al. 2003;Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007). Moreover, 1 week measurements permit calculation of daily variability of metabolic parameters and their relationship to meta-parameters and within-lake parameters. With increasing lake area and water depth, temporal variations in the magnitude of physical mixing affecting different pelagic populations are likely to decline. Reduced external input of nutrients and DOC per unit water volume with increasing lake size should also reduce the carrying capacity for phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria and fish per unit volume and, thereby, dampen population changes and blooms.',\n",
       " '## Materials and methods ## Study sites We studied lake metabolism in relation to physical, chemical and biological characteristics for about 1 week (6-8 days) in 25 medium to high alkaline lakes during May and June 2007. Systems ranged from ponds (0.1 ha) to midsized (1,729 ha) lakes, and were all located in calcareous moraines in Denmark (Table 1). Lakes were sampled in a random order to avoid bias from changing meteorological conditions during the study. Throughout the study, meteorological conditions were measured from a buoy placed on Lake Slotssø. Daily average wind speed (0.3-5.4 m s -1 , min-max) and solar irradiance (5-55 mol photons m -2 day -1 ) showed large daily variability, but did not change significantly during the course of the study',\n",
       " 'Lakes were chosen to cover large ranges in lake size, forest cover, TP, Chl and DOC concentrations. Lake area, catchment area, %forest cover in the catchment and drainage ratio (catchment area:lake area) were obtained for each lake using the digital Areal Information System (Nielsen et al. 2000). To evaluate effects of forest cover on local wind and light conditions, we also determined the proportion of forest in the 200 m wide riparian zone around the lakes from aerial photographs.',\n",
       " \"## Limnological variables Triplicate water samples were collected once from each lake as a depth integrated sample from the upper mixed layer at the center between 10 and 12 o'clock. Samples were analyzed for chlorophyll a, DOC, nutrients, alkalinity and pH.

Stedmon, unpubl. data). Total phosphorus (TP) was determined for unfiltered samples by persulfate digestion according to Eaton et al. (1995) and assayed according to Kragh and Sondergaard (2004). Water for determination of pH, alkalinity and CO 2 was transferred to closed, dark glass bottles to avoid CO 2 exchange with the air and prevent photosynthesis before measurement in the laboratory within 2 h. The pH was measured with Radiometer equipment (accuracy 0.01 pH unit)',\n",
       " 'Acidimetric titration of alkalinity (acid neutralizing capacity, ANC), ionic strength, pH and temperature were used to calculate concentrations of free CO 2 according to Rebsdorf (1972). The calculated CO 2 concentrations have previously been shown to be in close agreement with direct CO 2 measurements on an IRGA using a headspace equilibration technique (Sand-Jensen and Frost-Christensen 1998). Fluorescence of DOC was measured on a Varian Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. An emission spectrum was measured every 2 nm between 300 and 600 nm, whilst exciting at 370 nm. The fluorescence index (FI;McKnight et al. 2001) was derived by taking the ratio of the fluorescence at 450 to that at 500 nm. This index can be used to characterize the chemical composition of DOC and indicate the relative contribution of terrestrial and aquatic organic matter',\n",
       " 'Index values typically range between 1 and 2, with terrestrial plant material resulting in low values.',\n",
       " 'Depth profiles of oxygen and temperature were recorded in situ by an YSI 600XL multisonde. The vertical light attenuation coefficient (K D, 400-700 nm) was determined from the depth profile of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) using a LiCor 4p sensor. K D was calculated as the slope of a linear regression model of irradiance (E z ) versus depth (z): ln(E z ) = b ? K D z.',\n",
       " '## Physics and metabolism from sonde measurements We deployed a buoy at the centre of each lake to measure surface PAR, wind speed, water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) for about 1 week. Three sets of this equipment were moved between lakes in a random order. Surface PAR was measured 1 m above the surface using a HOBO 2p quantum sensor. Wind speed was measured 1.2 m above the lake using a HOBO anemometer. Surface PAR and wind speed at the centre of each lake were normalized to measurements made throughout the summer in medium-sized Lake Slotssø (22 ha, 15% forest cover; Table 1). Normalization was simply the ratio of the wind speed at a lake to that of Lake Slotssø. This permitted comparison among the 25 lakes despite changes in mean weekly wind velocity and surface PAR during the summer',\n",
       " 'Water temperature was measured every 10 min during buoy deployment at several water depths, using a string of Stow Away Tidbit loggers. These data permitted calculation of mixing depth (Z mix ) at high frequency according to an empirical curve-fitting procedure (Staehr et al. 2010a). Dissolved oxygen was measured at 0.5 m either with an Oxyguard DO sensor or a YSI 600XL multisonde. Oxygen sensors were cleaned and calibrated prior and after each application. Electrode drift was small and was corrected for assuming it is linear over time.

Assuming a neutrally stable boundary layer, wind speed (U) at 10 m was calculated from our measurements at 1.2 m using the relationship in Smith (1985).',\n",
       " 'Because there is no photosynthesis at night, we assume nighttime R equals nighttime NEP measured from 1 h past sunset until 1 h before sunrise. Assuming that the daytime rate of R is equal to the nighttime rate (Hanson et al. 2003;Lauster et al. 2006) we calculated daily respiration rates as hourly R during nighttime 9 24 h. GPP was determined as the sum of daytime NEP and R, and daily NEP was finally calculated as GPP -R (where R is in positive numbers).\\nFor ease of comparison, we present GPP values as positive and R values as negative. Volumetric metabolic rates (mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 ) were turned into areal rates (mol O 2 m -2 day -1 ) by multiplying with daily estimates of Z mix for stratified lakes and mean water depth for fully mixed lakes.',\n",
       " '## Pelagic metabolism from bottle measurements While calculation of whole-lake metabolism from sonde measurements are relatively common, measurements of benthic metabolism are rare because they require special sediment chambers and Scuba diving to set up and many replicates are needed because of great spatial heterogeneity. Because we wanted to make a comparative analysis among many lakes, direct sediment measurements were not an option. Instead, we evaluated the influence of benthic processes on free water measures of metabolism as the difference between measured whole-lake metabolism by oxygen sondes in open waters and simultaneous measurements of pelagic metabolism in bottle incubations. Replicate water samples from 0.5 m depth were used to determine net photosynthesis and respiration as the rate of oxygen change in closed 10 ml bottles during incubation for 13.5-23.4 h at ambient temperature. Bottles were placed on a rotating wheel (12 rpm) in a temperatureconstant incubator and illuminated by cool-white fluorescence tubes from one side',\n",
       " 'Oxygen concentrations in the samples before and after incubation were measured using an oxygen electrode (OX500, Unisense with a picoammeter, PA2000, connected to a laptop computer). The electrode was calibrated at the incubation temperature in water at 100 and 0% air saturation. The irradiance was measured inside the incubation bottles with a minute 4p LiCor underwater light sensor. Samples were exposed to seven different irradiances ranging from 36 to 714 lmol photons m -2 s -1 by using a set of neutral filters in front of the bottles. Samples for dark respiration measurements were wrapped in aluminum foil. From the obtained rates of net oxygen production (NP) at different irradiances (I), NP-I curves were constructed using the nonlinear model of Webb et al. (1974) in SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., 1994):',\n",
       " 'where NP is net and GP max is maximum gross photosynthesis (mg O 2 L -1 h -1 ), a is the initial slope of photosynthesis versus irradiance, Int is the intersection with the y-axis corresponding to dark respiration and E mean is the mean available irradiance in the mixed zone. Daily light availability (E mean ; mol photons m -2 day -1 ) was calculated as an average for the mixed surface zone. Using data for surface irradiance (E 0 ; lmol photons m -2 s -1 ), mixing depth (m), and light attenuation (K D ; m -1 ), with a constant of 0.1 for back-scattering and surface reflection, b (Kirk 1994), E mean was calculated from the equation: Riley (1957).',\n",
       " 'Each NP-I curve was examined visually and obvious outliers were excluded to obtain reasonable models. NP-I models that did not saturate at high irradiance were also excluded.

Using the derived NP models and measurements of ambient irradiance, we calculated net primary production in daylight (NPP bottle ; mg O 2 m -3 day -1 ) by integrating hourly NP rates from sunrise to sunset as: NPP = mean NP 9 h of daylight. Daily respiration (R bottle ; O 2 m -3 day -1 ) were calculated by multiplying hourly rates by 24',\n",

       " 'The influence of benthic processes on rates of wholelake metabolism was evaluated by subtracting measured pelagic rates (bottle incubations) from sonde based rates using the diel open water technique. According to the sonde-bottle estimates of GPP and R, the influence of benthic processes declined significantly with increasing lake area, water depth and drainage ratio (only R, but almost GPP), but showed no significant relationship to forest cover (Fig. 6a, b; Table 2). Since sonde estimates of whole-lake NEP were generally more negative than bottle estimates of pelagic NEP, the NEP sonde-bottle estimates were mostly negative (Fig. 6c; 19 lakes in total). As lake area and water depth increased, pelagic and whole-lake NEP rates became more similar causing the residual NEP estimates to approach zero (Fig. 6c)',\n",

Among meta-parameters, mean lake depth was the best predictor of GPP and R, and both decreased with increasing water depth. A combination of lake area and %forest cover was the best predictor of NEP (Table 3A). Light and temperature did not contribute significantly to explain between lake variability in GPP, R or NEP, suggesting that differences in these drivers were small and unimportant across the studied lakes during the study period (Table 3B). Algal biomass (Chl) was, as expected, the best predictor of GPP, while high rates of respiration and strong net heterotrophy (NEP \\\\ 0) were both related to high DOC (Table 3B)',\n",
       " 'Evaluating the combined effect of meta-parameters and biological and physical conditions on weekly rates of whole lake metabolism, showed that GPP increased with higher algal biomass and lower water depth (Table 3C). Similarly, respiration increased with DOC and decreased with water depth. Variations in NEP were best explained by DOC, with no significant contributions from either lake size or forest cover. Thus, except for NEP, combining metaparameters with internal biological drivers raised the overall explanatory power (r 2 ) of variations in lake metabolism by 14-15% to 57-63% (Table 3C).',\n",
       " '## Discussion Overall, this study revealed strong broad-scale scaling patterns of lake metabolism and limnological properties to lake meta-parameters. With increasing lake area and depth, lakes received more light, were less wind exposed, had clearer water, deeper mixing depth and contained less nutrients and DOC, causing lakes to be less net heterotrophic and with less importance of benthic metabolism and less day-to-day variability in GPP. Also, with increasing forest cover lakes become shaded and less wind exposed, more humic and CO 2 rich, and more net heterotrophic. Meta-parameters were found to have as many significant, but usually weaker relationships, to whole-lake and benthic metabolism as the intrinsic drivers (TP, Chl and DOC) that are directly linked to photosynthesis and respiration',\n",
       " 'Combining water depth and Chl to predict GPP, and water depth and DOC to predict R, lead to stronger models of the variability of metabolism among the studied 25 lakes, stressing the importance of physical boundary conditions for lake performance.',\n",
       " '## Influence of lake size and forest cover on limnological properties Physico-chemical features in 25 medium to high alkaline Danish lakes varied significantly with lake size and differences in forest cover of the catchments (Table 1). In agreement with previous studies, surface irradiance and wind exposure increased with lake surface area, but decreased with increasing shelter and shading from the Fig. 6 Difference between sonde and bottle based metabolic rates and its relationships to lake area. The difference between whole-lake metabolic estimates, determined using the open water diel O 2 technique (sonde), and pelagic metabolism calculated from oxygen changes in bottles, is used to represent an effect of benthic metabolism. As lakes become larger, the effect of benthic metabolism (mainly respiration) becomes less important and the difference between NEP derived from sondes and bottles decreases. Data are averages over 6-8 days',\n",
       " 'Filled circles are fully-mixed lakes and open circles represent thermally stratified lakes forest surrounding the lakes (Fee et al. Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). Also, small surface areas were, as expected, statistically linked to shallow water and shallow mixing depth (Strasbaska 1980;Duarte and Kalff 1989;Fee et al. 1996). Our findings that small lakes are generally richer in nutrients, algal biomass, dissolved organic matter and CO 2 than large lakes located in the same surroundings, likewise agree well with previous broad-scale comparisons (Søndergaard et al. 2005;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007;Hanson et al. 2007;No ˜ges 2009).',\n",
       " 'Loading of DOC to lakes has previously been associated with the amount of wetlands in the watershed (Gergel et al. 1999), in particular wetlands with coniferous vegetation (Xenopoulos et al. 2003). The catchments of our study lakes had a small share of wetlands (0-7%), and DOC concentration was better related to the proportion of forest in the catchments, suggesting that regional models have limited applicability in predicting DOC in other geographical areas of the world (Xenopoulos et al. 2003). The strong influence of lake area and forest cover on lake DOC (Fig. 3a, b) supports two explanations. Firstly, hydrological input of DOC and nutrients across the terrestrial-aquatic boundary increases when the drainage ratio (catchment area to lake surface area) is high',\n",
       " 'Secondly, small lakes possess a long shoreline for input of air-born terrestrial organic matter relative to lake surface area and volume and receive significant amounts of organic matter from litter fall (Gasith and Hasler 1976). The implications of higher DOC for physical and biological processes were firstly, shallower surface mixed layers and reduced light penetration (Snucins and Gunn 2000;Houser 2006) secondly, reduced planktonic production and increased planktonic respiration (Del Giorgio and Peters 1994), and finally, increased ecosystem respiration through mineralization of allochthonous organic carbon (Hanson et al. 2003;Staehr et al. 2010a).',\n",
       " 'The fluorescence index (FI) as derived by McKnight et al. (2001) suggested that not only does the amount of DOC vary notably across the studied lakes, but the quality (or origin) of the DOC varies as well (Fig. 3e, f). In agreement with expectations, we found that small lakes tend to contain more terrestrial material, whereas autochthonous production was a more important DOC source in larger lakes. The low FI in algal rich small lakes (Table 2) show that the terrestrial input of DOC is much higher than the input of DOC from degrading or leaking phytoplankton',\n",
       " 'Although large lakes do receive allochthonous DOC, its signal is overwhelmed by the production of Table 3 Stepwise multiple linear regression models of volumetric (mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 ) rates of GPP, R and NEP as a function of (A) Lake meta-parameters: lake area, mean water depth and %forest cover in the lake catchment, and (B) Biological and physical drivers: Chl, DOC, E mean and water temperature, and (C) a combination of lake meta-parameters and, biological and physical drivers autochthonous DOC and the greater exposure to chemical and microbial degradation as a result of longer residence times (Lindell et al. 2000).',\n",
       " '## Regulation of ecosystem metabolism by meta-parameters Previous investigations on the influence of lake morphometry and catchment conditions on pelagic productivity of lakes has provided deviating conclusions. A global comparison of 55 shallow to deep lakes (1-730 m) showed that volumetric estimates of primary production decreased with increasing lake size, but was more strongly influenced by light and nutrient availability (Brylinsky and Mann 1973). In agreement with our findings (Fig. 2), studies in small to large lakes (1-3 9 10 6 ha) by Duarte and Kalff (1989) found declining trophy and phytoplankton biomass with increasing area and mean depth. Work by Fee and coworkers on seven mid-sized to very large pristine lakes (30-10 7 ha), however, showed that lake size was a poor predictor of lake trophy and phytoplankton photosynthesis (Fee et al. 1992(Fee et al',\n",
       " ', 1996;;Guildford et al. 1994). This response was explained by a greater turbulence and probability of nutrient regeneration within the mixed layer in very large lakes and greater upward nutrient flux (N and Si, but not P) across the thermocline. Also, in more recent studies of small lakes (0.02-20 ha), nutrients, algal biomass and CO 2 super saturation decreased with lake size, but no apparent scaling was found for pelagic metabolism (Sand-Jensen andStaehr 2007, 2009). Thus, previous studies on the importance of lake morphometry for primary productivity generally support our findings in small to midsized lakes (0.1-1,700 ha). However, relationships were weaker or inconsistent for the full range of lake sizes and relationships also depended on methodology. Earlier conclusions on lake metabolism were all based on bottle incubations, which only provide estimates of pelagic productivity',\n",
       " 'We used open water diel changes in DO to estimate whole-lake metabolism, which offer more reliable results and integrate pelagic and benthic processes under conditions of full vertical mixing (see more in Staehr et al. 2010b).',\n",
       " 'Forest lakes received less light and were expected to receive less easily accessible dissolved nutrients for phytoplankton production compared to lakes in fertilized agricultural landscapes (Larsen et al. 1994;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2009). We therefore expected high forest cover to be associated with lower nutrient status, phytoplankton biomass and GPP in the lakes (Jackson and Hecky 1980). Nutrient levels were, however, similar for our open and forested lakes, and little differences in GPP were found between lakes of the same size but different forest cover. High inputs of organic material in forest lakes, on the other hand, stimulate growth and metabolism of bacteria and zooplankton and enhance community respiration and constrain phytoplankton production due to greater background shading from colored DOC (Christensen et al. 1996;Jonsson et al. 2001;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007)',\n",
       " 'Browncolored small lakes in forest catchments were therefore significantly more net heterotrophic, in agreement with previous studies (Del Giorgio et al. 1999;Sand-Jensen andStaehr 2007, 2009). The high perimeter to area ratio for small lakes, coupled with high DOC flux and retention (Curtis and Schindler 1997) elevated carbon mineralization and net efflux of CO 2 to the atmosphere.',\n",
       " '## Influence of benthic processes on whole-lake metabolism With increasing lake area, water depth tends to increase and the relative influence of benthic primary production can be expected to decrease as light becomes more limiting (Kemp et al. 1992). Although the importance of benthic primary producers is expected to be higher in shallow systems, poor light conditions associated with eutrophication may switch the dominance from benthic to pelagic processes (Vadeboncoeur et al. 2003). Our lakes were all placed in medium to high alkaline, nutrient-rich catchments, with relatively poor light conditions for benthic plant growth even in shallow lakes (See Table 1). Except for a few shallow lakes, most of our lakes had little submerged vegetation, and the benthic zone was accordingly dominated by carbon-rich and oxygen demanding sediments (author, pers obs), suggesting dominance of heterotrophic processes in the benthic environment',\n",
       " 'In support of this, we generally found higher sonde based (*whole-lake) than bottle based (*pelagic) respiration rates, especially so in small and shallow lakes (Table 2; Fig. 6b). Also the difference between sonde and bottle based NEP declined with increasing lake depth (Table 2) and area (Fig. 6c), indicating the influence of benthic processes on whole-lake metabolism to decrease with increasing lake size.',\n",
       " 'As shown in Coloso et al. (2011), diel changes in mixing depth and microstratification occurred in all of the lakes that were deep enough to stratify (12 out of 25). For these lakes, metabolic rates based on sonde measurements at shallow depth do not represent whole-lake estimates but rather the upper mixed layer (Coloso et al. 2008). The influence of benthic processes is therefore likely underestimated for our stratified lakes by a degree which depends on the volume of water below the mixed layer depth and the proportion of the lake bottom not being exposed to the upper mixed layer (Staehr et al. 2011), which in turn depends on lake morphometry and variability in mixing depth (Coloso et al. 2011)',\n",
       " 'Applying hypsographic tables for the stratified lakes, we find that (mean 57%) of the lake volume and 20-70% (mean 53%) of the lake bottom is represented within the upper mixed layers of our stratified lakes. This suggests that a variable but likely substantial benthic signal is in fact included in our sondebased estimates of metabolism in these lakes. Removing data from stratified lakes in our analysis (open circles in Fig. 6) would furthermore only weaken and not change relationships between the influence of benthic processes on lake metabolism and lake size.',\n",
       " '## Areal versus volumetric rates In agreement with expectations, the implicit scaling was much weaker for areal than volumetric rates, and only GPP was significantly related to lake area (Table 2). Weak or absent relations to areal rates may derive from the confounding effect of co-variation of lake surface area and water depth. However, light utilization for photosynthesis per unit area is also known to be relatively similar among different communities and among systems of different depth (Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998), and shallow lakes can accordingly be viewed as a compressed version of deeper lakes (Brylinsky and Mann 1973;Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998) with little differences in areal rates of productivity.',\n",
       " 'Comparison of lake productivity amongst contrasting lakes can also be obtained by normalizing GPP to phytoplankton biomass, which serves as an index of the growth potential of algae (Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007). For the lakes in this study, chlorophyll specific GPP decreased significantly with increasing TP concentration (r = -0.42, p \\\\ 0.05), while it increased with increasing mean light availability (r = 0.47, p \\\\ 0.05). These findings suggest that the efficiency of nutrient use of the autotrophic community increases with the degree of nutrient limitation, and that light availability is more important than nutrient availability for variation of primary production',\n",
       " 'Considering that the mean available irradiance (a function of surface irradiance, light attenuation and mixing depth) was unrelated to lake area and depth (Table 2), it is not surprising that areal rates of GPP, R and NEP show weak dependencies of lake morphometry.',\n",
       " '## Drivers of daily variability in metabolism According to general scaling theory, the chemical and biological components of small aquatic systems are more variable as they are more sensitive to initial conditions, have limited external exchange of material and organisms with surroundings, and low buffering capacity (Kemp et al. 2001). Studies of scaling rules in aquatic ecosystems have furthermore shown that food chain length decreases with reduced lake volume (Post et al. 2000) and these smaller lakes are less species rich, have less interspecies competition, and higher chance of rise and fall of populations.',\n",
       " 'In this study, daily variability of GPP declined with lake area and was highest in small nutrient rich and productive lakes. High productivity in nutrient-rich lakes is known to be associated with high day-to-day variability in GPP, R and NEP, and this is suggested to reflect the dynamic behavior of the lake ecosystem in response to changes in incident irradiance and available irradiance in the mixed surface layers (Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007). High day-today variability in GPP in small lakes may also be impacted by changes of physical processes such as advection and inflow, and a greater influence from littoral metabolism (Vadeboncoeur et al. 2001). High variability of GPP also occurred in the small DOC rich lakes, which is somewhat counter intuitive. High input of DOC may restrict photosynthesis through greater competition for available light (Staehr et al',\n",
       " '2010a) and greater competition for nutrients among autotrophs and heterotrophs (Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998) tend to reduce the temporal variability of metabolism. This stabilizing effect of DOC in forested lakes may also be due to the fact that DOC is a relatively time-stable energy source to bacteria and zooplankton (Cole et al. 2002). Thus, our results suggest that the stabilizing effect of DOC on GPP to be less influential than the destabilizing effects of high levels of nutrient, short food-chain length and stronger physical disturbance found in smaller sized lakes.',\n",
       " 'Our findings support the use of metabolic responses in lakes as a common metric that integrates terrestrial impacts on lake ecosystems (Williamson et al. 2008). The strong influence of lake morphometry and catchment conditions suggest that broad-scale comparisons among lakes and evaluation of their responses to human impacts (e.g., eutrophication, deforestation and climate change) need to take into account the strong implicit scaling with the physical boundary conditions. These operate directly through differences in shading, sheltering, physical mixing and indirectly through input of nutrients and organic matter.',\n",

       " '## INTRODUCTION The functioning of small water bodies may differ in a variety of aspects from that of lakes (Biggs et al., 2005;Likens, 2009). Even though small aquatic ecosystems create favourable conditions for a number of organisms of various ecological requirements, they have never received much attention from researchers compared with larger reservoirs (Oertli et al., 2002). This especially applies to a specific and very unique kind of pond -meteorite craters, which were the object of this research. The origin of ponds is very diverse and they can be created by a wide range of natural processes such as glaciation, volcanic activity, land subsidence, wind or river action, and tree falls, as well as by human activities such as mineral extraction or water storage (Oertli et al., 2005). Meteorite crater water bodies, however, belong to a very rare kind of aquatic ecosystem',\n",
       " 'This is why our knowledge of their functioning, including seasonal changes in the structure and dynamics of their inhabiting organisms, is still rudimentary. Therefore, a study on the relationships between zooplankton occurrence and the physical-chemical features of such unique ecosystems is extremely necessary, especially as human impact and adverse climatic conditions may contribute to their rapid disappearance. One of the main problems connected with the functioning of small aquatic ecosystems may lie in an increase in trophic conditions which are equated with the amount of nutrients dissolved in water and deposited in sediments. The quality of waters will reflect the character of the catchment area and also the level of anthropogenic transformation in the surrounding area (Dodson et al., 2007), particularly when a pond is situated in the vicinity of urban areas',\n",
       " 'This is why the main focus of this study, conducted on the meteorite crater ponds which are located in the neighbourhood of the city of Pozna ń, was directed at estimating the impact of abiotic features of the aquatic environment on the structure of both rotifer and crustacean communities in seasonal terms, including spring, summer and autumn. Furthermore, small water bodies create vital hotspots and refugia for aquatic biodiversity in a variety of landscape types. This is particularly important on the local scale as they are aquatic habitats of a great abundance of distribution, being usually much more common than larger lakes (Søndergaard et al., 2005). Their role in agricultural, forested and urban regions is vital. As the morphometric features of ponds will make them prone to changes occurring in the surrounding environment, they are among the most threatened habitats (Oertli et al., 2005)',\n",
       " 'Moreover, the vast majority of small water bodies undergo the process of terrestrialisation, which may result in negative implications for biodiversity. Not only will the concentration of nutrients structure the assemblages of plankton in small water bodies, but physical factors will also play a role (Karabin et al., 1997;Wilk-Wo źniak et al., 2011;Czerniawski and Domagała, 2012).

The area within the reserve is made up of a unique combination of both the meteorites and the morphological effects of their fall (Stankowski, 2001). These craters are among the largest groups of craters on Earth, both in relation to their size and number. They form a group of seven meteorite craters, located on the slope of \"Góra Moraska\", which creates a culmination of an end-moraine ridge. They are round in shape and shallow, with the maximum depth of the largest water body not exceeding 1 m (Table I). All ponds were transparent to the bottom during the whole investigation period',\n",

Two ponds (Nos. I and II), that underwent the investigation, carried water throughout the whole period of examination; however, in the autumn season a considerable loss of water depth was observed. At the same time, two other craters (Nos. III and IV) had no water in the autumn. As a result of oxygen deficiencies and low pH no fish occur in these water bodies.',\n",

Zooplankton material was taken in triplicate at each site using a calibrated vessel of a volume of 5 L.

This would indicate that a need exists for the protection of such ecosystems, especially if they are situated in association with urban areas, such as the city of Pozna ń. This whole group of rare species made up over 12% of the taxonomic structure, which also underlines the great variation and specificity of these aquatic ecosystems.',\n",
       " 'Seasonality is an aspect of the functioning of aquatic ecosystems which is widely discussed, mainly in relation to lakes ( Čiamporová-Zaovi čová and Čiampor, 2011). In the case of small water bodies, due to unfavourable morphometric features and very changeable environmental factors it may be difficult to predict any pattern of abundance distribution or the occurrence of particular species. This is particularly the case when the studied ponds are of an astatic character, such as meteor craters, which are characterised by dramatic changes in the water level. Four ponds underwent analyses; however, two of them (Nos. III and IV) dried out in the autumn season. Therefore, many species which inhabit such aquatic ecosystems must be opportunists, well specialised and adapted to such unfavourable conditions',\n",
       " 'As a result of our examination, the presence of 49 zooplankton species was found in total; however, a temporal and spatial differentiation was also noticed. The least various taxa composition was found to be in the spring, when TP and chlorophyll a concentrations were also lowest. A more variable taxonomic structure was recorded in the autumn, and especially in the summer, when DIN content was highest. Although the values of the Shannon-Weaver index of zooplankton diversity were not very high on average, due to the temporal character of some of the investigated ponds, they were highest during the optimum summer season, before half of the ponds dried out. A spatial differentiation of taxonomic richness in relation to particular ponds was also found, especially when two groups of craters were compared -permanent (ponds I and II) and temporal (ponds III and IV)',\n",
       " 'The highest species richness of zooplankton was attributed to astatic ponds, where rotifers prevailed in crater No. IV and crustaceans in crater No. III. At the same time, the lowest values occurred inversely in these two ponds, which reflects niche segregation between both groups of animal plankton.',\n",
       " 'There were thirteen taxa (over 25% of the taxonomic structure) whose frequency was higher than 50%, which indicates a great variation in environmental factors among particular crater ponds and study seasons. Most of them represented large-bodied crustaceans and littoralassociated rotifers. Only three of these species (Keratella cochlearis, Bosmina longirostris and Daphnia pulex) were strictly pelagic (Flössner, 1972;Pejler, 1995), so the optimum of their occurrence is usually found in the pelagic zone. The occurrence of D. pulex, which dominated throughout all the seasons, strongly indicates the lack or very weak pressure of predation attributed to these ponds. When fish are absent, invertebrate predators develop abundant communities. Therefore, we found a large representation of larvae of Culex sp. and Chaoborus sp',\n",
       " 'in our ponds ( Świdnicki et al., 2010), which must have had an impact on a smaller fraction of zooplankton such as rotifers. Thus, rotifer species with specific anti-predator adaptations, e.g. Keratella cochlearis, that has evolved long, bristle-like spines (Pejler, 1995), could successfully develop in such conditions. Among species with the highest frequency, representatives typical of small water bodies (e.g. bdelloids, Lecane elsa, Daphnia pulex, Megacyclops viridis, Ceriodaphnia laticaudata) were observed. Most of them possessed adaptations to living in astatic reservoirs such as, e.g., M. viridis, which willingly inhabits temporary water bodies as it can use a diapause to survive the dry season (Rybak and Bł ȩdzki, 2010).',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, a seasonal variation in zooplankton abundance was also obtained, with the maximum mean numbers obtained in the autumn in the case of rotifers and in the summer in the group of crustaceans. The lowest densities for both groups of animals were found in the springtime. Nogrady et al. (1993) refer to temperature as one of the essential factors influencing the seasonal succession of rotifers in water bodies located in a temperate climate.',\n",
       " 'Anuraeopsis fissa, which occurred in the examined water bodies as a dominating species in the autumn samples, is a warm stenoterm organism. It prefers a wide range of pH, although it builds its most abundant communities in neutral waters with a high concentration of detritus (B ẽrzinš and Pejler, 1987). Therefore, food availability and quality, reflected by the highest content of chlorophyll a in the summer and autumn and lowest in the spring, may also contribute to seasonal variation in zooplankton abundance. What is also very important is that A. fissa easily adapts to oxygen deficiency or even to a lack of oxygen (Radwan et al., 2004). In the examined ponds very low concentrations of dissolved oxygen were recorded (unpublished data); therefore, A. fissa was able to build such an abundant population during the autumn season.',\n",
       " 'Despite the fact that all the ponds were of the same origin and were situated within a short distance of each other, they differed not only in reference to species composition and community density; their dominating structure varied greatly. Only two species out of 16 dominants were common for all the ponds and seasons, which was connected with the temporary nature of most of these craters. One of them was Daphnia pulex, a species characteristic of temporary water bodies, which is well acclimatised to low oxygen concentrations and exhibits a wider capacity for respiration that is relatively \"insensitive\" to changing oxygen levels. Moreover, D. pulex is able to synthesise haemoglobin, which is also a well-known phenomenon for adapting to low oxygen content (Weider and Lampert, 1985). This is why it was among the dominating species in all the examined meteorite crater ponds and in each season. However, although D',\n",
       " 'pulex was a frequent dominant, a variable crustacean community occurred. This is contrary to the fact that in water bodies which are characterised by a dominance of large daphnids, small zooplankton species are scarce (Arnott and Vanni, 1993). The explanation for this phenomenon may be connected with the specificity of the examined ponds, where a thick layer of bottom sediments may have created an additional ecological niche for the inhabiting organisms. Among rotifers, bdelloids were found to dominate in each season and in each water body, and contributed to the extremely high densities of rotifers reached in the autumn. They are a class of the phylum Rotifera, having obligatory parthenogenetic reproduction and being able to withstand harsh periods through anhydrobiosis. They are typically a part of benthos or periphyton; however, some bdelloid species (e.g',\n",
       " \"Rotaria) can be found occasionally in the plankton (Ricci and Melone, 2000), which was the case in the present study. The mass domination of Rotaria occurred as the examined water bodies were at the level of drying up. This is consistent with bdelloid's fantastic ecological adaptability, as they can easily shift from an active to an anhydrobiotic stage, which helps them to live in particularly ephemeral, even predominantly dry conditions (Segers, 2008).\",\n",
       " 'The occurrence of zooplankton depends on a variety of environmental factors; however, it is often difficult to predict its response to changes in an astatic ecosystem, such as a meteorite crater. However, conductivity, which is a useful measure of water quality and which can indicate industrial pollution or urban runoff, can influence the distribution of a variety of organisms in small water bodies (Dalu et al., 2012). It had the contrasting effect on two groups of studied zooplankton of various ecological requirements. Its higher values stimulated the abundance of pelagic species, while densities of littoral species were restricted along with the increase in the conductivity level. Among pelagic species the presence of indicators of high trophic conditions (e.g. Anuraeopsis fissa, Bosmina longirostris or Chydorus sphaericus) was obtained. This can confirm a positive relationship with conductivity, which is usually higher in contaminated and highly eutrophic waters',\n",

In the examined ponds Anuraeopsis fissa and bdelloids corresponded positively with chlorophyll a concentration. Bdelloids are described as feeding mainly on suspended organic particles and A. fissa feeds exclusively on detritus and bacteria (Pourriot, 1977).

       " 'Ephemeroptera larvae are recognized worldwide for their sensitivity to oxygen depletion in running waters, and are therefore commonly used as bioindicators in many monitoring programmes. Mayflies inhabiting lentic waters, like lakes and ponds, in contrary have been poorly prospected in biomonitoring. For this purpose, a better understanding of their distribution in lentic habitats and of the relations of species presence with environmental conditions are needed. Within this framework, 104 ponds were sampled in Switzerland. The Ephemeroptera are found to be an insect order particularly well represented in the ponds studied here (93% of the lowland ponds). Nevertheless, in terms of diversity, they are relatively poorly represented (mean species number = 1.9). Two species dominated: Cloeon dipterum (Baetidae) and Caenis horaria (Caenidae)',\n",
       " 'The investigations contributed to the updating of the geographical distribution of the species in Switzerland, as many of the observations appear to be from new localities. The trophic state of ponds appears here to be important for Ephemeroptera communities. First, there is a negative relationship between total phosphorus (TP) concentrations and species richness. Second, the presence of Caenis horaria or Cloeon dipterum is dependent on the trophic state. Caenis horaria is most closely associated with low levels of TP concentrations, while Cloeon dipterum appears to be less sensitive, and is most frequently found in hypertrophic conditions. A probable consequence of these relations, is that Baetidae are always present when Caenidae are also present. Contrastingly, Baetidae is observed as the only mayflies family present in several ponds.',\n",
       " \"## Introduction Mayflies are considered as ''keystone'' species and their presence is believed to be an important environmental indicator of oligotrophic to mesotrophic (i.e. low to moderately productive) conditions in running waters (Barbour et al., 1999;Bauernfeind & Moog, 2000). A high sensitivity of mayfly taxa to oxygen depletion, acidification, and various contaminants including metals, ammonia and other chemicals was demonstrated in both observational and experimental studies (Hubbard & Peters, 1978;Resh & Jackson, 1993;Moog et al., 1997;Hickey & Clements, 1998). Various Biological Indices including mayflies to assess water quality have been developed over the years (Lenat, 1988;Metcalfe, 1989;Kerans & Karr, 1994)\",\n",
       " 'Subsequently, many of the biological water quality assessment methods for streams include Ephemeroptera, as for example the EPT (Ephemeroptera + Plecoptera + Trichoptera) taxa richness (Lenat & Penrose, 1996) which has been incorporated into studies in the United States and in many other countries. Other examples include the River InVertebrate Prediction and Classification System (RIVPACS) for the UK (Wright et al., 1998) and the Indice Biologique Global Normalise ´(IBGN) for France (AFNOR, 1992). A major EU project with 14 participating member states entitled STAndardisation of River Classifications (STAR) has now been established, which will calibrate different biological survey results against ecological quality classifications that have to be developed for the Water Framework Directive of 2000 (Furse et al., 2006).',\n",
       " 'On the contrary, mayflies inhabiting lentic waters (e.g. lakes and ponds), have been poorly used in biomonitoring programmes (see however Madenjian et al., 1998). Nevertheless, in such environments, we could expect that mayflies also adequately integrate some aspects of water quality. Ephemeroptera have also other advantages for monitoring: they are highly visible, relatively easy to sample and are represented by only a few species in such habitats, which makes identification easier. In Lake Erie, Ephemeroptera are successfully used in biomonitoring, following the example of a recent study that showed burrowing mayfly nymphs (Hexagenia spp.) to be associated with an improvement of the ecosystem health (Schloesser & Nalepa, 2002). In smaller waterbodies like ponds, the water quality is rarely assessed. Nevertheless, with the implementation of the directive, such procedures will be developed',\n",

In a second step, their presence is assessed in relation to environmental variables, particularly the trophic state indicators (total phosphorus (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and conductivity).

The transparency was additionally recorded from a surface water sample using a Snellen tube. Laboratory analyses of the content of TP and TN were made with winter water samples. TP concentrations and TN concentrations were then used to classify each pond into one of the four following trophic categories: oligotrophic, mesotrophic, eutrophic or hypertrophic, as described by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (1982) and Wetzel (1983).',\n",

In addition, Cloeon dipterum and Caenis horaria, the two most abundant species present in many lowland ponds, were much less common at these altitudes. Indeed, most of the mayflies that are present in the subalpine and alpine belts were rare species.',\n",

Three of these variables were log-transformed: area, mean depth and sinuosity of the shoreline; five were transformed in categories: TP, TN, conductivity, transparency and altitudinal vegetation belt; and the last four were not transformed: presence versus absence of fishes, % of natural zone surrounding the waterbody, % of catchment area and macrophytes species richness.',\n",
       " 'A non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was conducted to test if there was a significant difference for three trophic state variables considered separately (concentrations of TP, TN or conductivity) between ponds where Cloeon dipterum or Caenis horaria were present or absent, respectively. In addition, a non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was performed to analyse the differences in the mayfly species richness between groups of ponds based upon their trophic state (being defined separately by TP, TN or conductivity values). Furthermore, Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) were used to model the occurrence of Cloeon dipterum, or of Caenis horaria with the purpose of (i) identifying the physico-chemical and environmental variables explaining the presence of these species in the ponds, and (ii) building predictive models of their occurrence',\n",

After an exploratory stepwise procedure of the same twelve selected variables as the ones taken for PCA, the least contributive were discarded to avoid an over-parameterization of the models.

Of the 85 species (and 11 families) of Ephemeroptera present in Switzerland, 12 species from five families were identified (Table 3). This list included logically a majority of lentic species; however, lotic species were also found to be present (i.e. Baetis rhodani, Centroptilum luteolum, Ephemera danica and Siphlonurus aestivalis), which could be explained by the presence of tributaries. The lotic species Baetis alpinus was additionally found in one alpine pond, and this independently of the presence of a tributary',\n",

Likewise, mayflies were not always absent from ponds over an altitude of 1,410 m: nine ponds over 1,410 m contained mayflies, mostly from the Baetidae or Caenidae families.',\n",
       " 'When present in a pond, the Ephemeroptera community diversity was low (see Table 3 and Fig. 1) and composed of only a few taxa (mean species number = 1.9 and mean family number = 1.6). The dominant lentic species were Cloeon dipterum (in 93% of the ponds containing Ephemeroptera) and Caenis horaria (in 45%). In 43% of the cases, ponds included only one family, generally the Baetidae with, in most of these cases, Cloeon dipterum being found alone. Otherwise, there was one case each where Cloeon simile was found alone or both together with Cloeon dipterum.

The model for Caenis horaria incorporated two more variables: mean depth which showed a complex response curve that seemed incoherent; and macrophytes species richness which showed a bell-shaped response curve: Caenis horaria seemed therefore to be associated with species-rich ponds.',\n",

       " 'The Ephemeroptera are particularly well represented, being observed in 93% of the lowland ponds (colline and montane). Nevertheless, in terms of species richness, they are relatively poorly represented (mean species number = 1.9). This is mainly due to the fact that most mayflies are adapted to living in running waters where the environmental conditions are drastically different from those of standing waters. Both Caenidae and Baetidae families contain some of the most resistant species to organic pollution and to low levels of oxygen (Macan, 1973;Bro ¨nmark & Hansson, 2000)',\n",
       " 'Two species dominate our data group: Cloeon dipterum and Caenis horaria, both of which are known to be very resistant to eutrophic conditions (group 6 in Solda ´n et al., 1998, or groups E-G in Kelly-Quinn & Bracken, 2000). Only a few additional mayfly species could potentially be observed in Swiss ponds. These are: n, number of ponds where the species was present. area = log e transformed m 2 ; total phosphorus (TP) = transformed into one of the four trophic categories as described by OECD (1982); mean depth = log e transformed cm; macrophyte species richness = not transformed Fig. 3 Response curves for the variables incorporated in the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) calculated for the presence of (a) Cloeon dipterum and (b) Caenis horaria',\n",
       " 'The dashed lines are approximate 95% confidence intervals around the smooth function lines. area = log e transformed m 2 ; total phosphorus (TP) = transformed into one of the four trophic categories as described by OECD (1982); mean depth = log e transformed cm; macrophyte species richness = not transformed. Vertical axes are scaled according to the dimensionless linear predictor',\n",
       " \"Leptophlebia marginata, Leptophlebia verspertina, Rhithrogena loyolaea (above altitude of 2,800 m), Ephemera glaucops (recently discovered in one location in eastern Switzerland); Ecdyonurus sp. (in drift conditions or at altitude), Paraleptophlebia werneri (elsewhere) and perhaps Arthroplea congener (although at present only found in Germany and Austria). Interestingly, all these species mentioned are rare species and found in special conditions. Many of our observations include new localities for Switzerland's Ephemeroptera, and therefore will contribute to the updating of the geographical distribution of the species presented in Sartori and Landolt (1999). Furthermore, altitudinal ranges presented by these authors will be largely revised, with new data for 7 out of the 12 species found in the sampled ponds (see Table 3).\",\n",
       " '## Mayflies and eutrophication Ephemeroptera species richness has a negative relationship with an increase of eutrophication (based on TP). Nevertheless, the presence of Ephemeroptera species in the studied ponds cannot be explained by the trophic state alone, since all simple direct relationships between the presence of Caenis horaria and Cloeon dipterum and the trophic state of water are not significant. However, in the model, taking into account the other predominant environmental variables (i.e. altitude, area, mean depth and macrophyte species richness), trophic state, based on TP, is significant. The two species appear to avoid hypertrophic ponds. Their optimum conditions are oligotrophic for Caenis horaria and eutrophic for Cloeon dipterum. This relationship with trophic conditions has already often been demonstrated in running water studies. For example, in Tachet et al',\n",
       " '(2000), the biological traits for Caenis sp. indicate that mesotrophic conditions are optimal for this genera. Contrastingly, Cloeon sp. could be found in either mesotrophic or eutrophic habitats. Furthermore, Baetidae appears as one of the Ephemeropteran families the most tolerant to organic pollution. For example, Cloeon dipterum is the European species that exhibits the greatest saprobic index among mayflies (SI = 2.6) making it a characteristic element of b-a mesosaprobic conditions. Caenis horaria and C. robusta are ranked as less tolerant (SI = 2.2) and more confined to b mesosaprobic environments (Moog, 1995;Moog et al., 1997).',\n",
       " 'Following these relations, a really interesting observation was made on the association of the two most common families observed in the ponds sampled. Baetidae is observed as the only Ephemeroptera family present in several ponds. This is not the case for Caenidae, which are found only if Baetidae are already present. This particularity has also been observed for several sets of water-bodies in the French Rho ˆne and Ain floodplains (Castella et al., 1984(Castella et al., , 1991;;Castella, 1987).',\n",
       " 'The presence of Caenidae alongside Baetidae, could be important for bioassessment work. As the potential number of mayfly species in such environment is normally low (five in general), the occurrence of an additional species from the Caenidae family may have some significance with regard to environmental conditions. On the contrary, the presence of rare species in ponds seems to depend more on special conditions than on trophic states. This finding represents an important development for the use of Ephemeroptera as bioindicators in Switzerland. Therefore, frequently observed species like Caenis sp. and Cloeon sp. seem to be more suitable to assess the trophic state of ponds (as demonstrated in this study).',\n",
       " 'The fact that Caenidae are more often absent from sampled ponds than Baetidae could be a discrepancy in the sampling dates among ponds. One hypothesis could be that Caenidae were not present in ponds sampled in late summer because the adult emergence occurs earlier in the season and before the sampling session. Caenis sp. shows large variations in their life history patterns as demonstrated for Caenis luctuosa by Cayrou & Cereghino (2003) and for Caenis horaria and Caenis luctuosa by Oertli (1992) and Ba ¨nziger (2000). Nevertheless, the population dynamics presented by these authors demonstrate that individuals of Caenis sp. are present in the water throughout the year (even if their repartition in size classes largely varies); This being the case, the time of sampling is probably not an explanation for the absence of this taxa',\n",
       " \"An alternative explanation could be the capacity of dispersion and colonisation since it is known that this capacity is greater for Baetidae than for Caenidae. Furthermore, Cloeon dipterum is relatively well known as a pioneering coloniser of new waterbodies and of temporary habitats (Sartori & Landolt, 1999). The explanation of Cloeon dipterum's ''success story'' is to be found in its peculiar biology, ecology, and physiology. It is one of the rare ovoviviparous species in Europe, with females having an unusual life span of about 2 weeks during which the whole embryonic development takes place in the genital ducts (Degrange, 1959;Solda ´n, 1979). Females are often found quite far from the waterbody where they were born and disperse actively towards new habitats, making it a true colonizer species\",\n",
       " 'Finally nymphs are detritivorous (Brown, 1961;Cianciara, 1980) and can afford very low levels of oxygen concentration, even anoxia in some conditions (Nagell, 1977a, b;Nagell & Fagerstro ¨m, 1978) and seem tolerant to rapid temperature changes (McKee & Atkinson, 2000). These traits enable C. dipterum to be very successful in small ponds where it encounters few competitors. In fact, this species is known to be relatively independent of environmental factors. Another hypothesis is that ponds where only Baetidae are present are young ponds or temporary ponds. However, this is not supported by our data since only 12 of the 71 ponds containing Baetidae are younger than 25 years old. Furthermore they are all permanent ponds',\n",
       " 'Therefore, the most likely explanation of this singularity is the trophic state of ponds as discussed in the previous section.',\n",
       " 'In conclusion, our study has demonstrated that there is a great potential in using mayflies as bioindicators for the management of the water quality of ponds. Indeed, a relationship with the trophic state of ponds is hereby revealed for Ephemeroptera species richness and for the presence of Caenis horaria and Cloeon dipterum. These findings allow us to propose two new metrics for the water assessment of Swiss ponds: first, the Ephemeroptera species richness and second the presence of Caenidae associated with Baetidae. Nevertheless, these metrics need to be tested before being integrated into routine monitoring. Furthermore, other investigations must be made to confirm the suitability of these pond bioindicators for areas outside of Switzerland. Moreover, as these two metrics are only based on a small number of species, it would be necessary to use them in conjunction with other metrics to enable accurate assessments',\n",
       " 'Other such metrics, based on species or families richness (from macroinvertebrates and macrophytes assemblages), are currently in development (Hering et al., 2004;Menetrey et al., 2005;Furse et al., 2006).

       " 'Agricultural ponds have a great potential as a means of capture and storage of water for irrigation. However, pond topography (small size, shallow depth) leaves them susceptible to environmental, agricultural, and anthropogenic exposures that may influence microbial dynamics. Therefore, the aim of this project was to characterize the bacterial and viral communities of pond water in the Mid-Atlantic United States with a focus on the late season (October-December), where decreasing temperature and nutrient levels can affect the composition of microbial communities. Ten liters of freshwater from an agricultural pond were sampled monthly, and filtered sequentially through 1 and 0.2 µm filter membranes. Total DNA was then extracted from each filter, and the bacterial communities were characterized using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.

       " 'Bacterial community profiling showed significant fluctuations over the sampling period, corresponding to changes in the condition of the pond freshwater (e.g., pH, nutrient load). In addition, there were significant differences in the alpha-diversity and core bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) between water fractions filtered through different pore sizes. The viral fraction was dominated by tailed bacteriophage of the order Caudovirales, largely those of the Siphoviridae family. Moreover, while present, genes involved in virulence/antimicrobial resistance were not enriched within the viral fraction during the study period. Instead, the viral functional profile was dominated by phage associated proteins, as well as those related to nucleotide production. Overall, these data suggest that agricultural pond water harbors a diverse core of bacterial and bacteriophage species whose abundance and composition are influenced by environmental variables characteristic of pond topology and the late season.',\n",
       " '## INTRODUCTION Growing urbanization and climate variability have placed immense pressure on the finite supply of groundwater available for agricultural irrigation. As a result, the exploration of alternative irrigation water sources, including recycled water and pond water, has become a global priority (Scheierling et al., 2006;Parsons et al., 2010;Ortega-Reig et al., 2014). While there is no universal standard, ponds are generally defined as small (1 m 2 to ∼50,000 m 2 ), shallow, standing water bodies that can either permanently or temporarily collect freshwater (Biggs et al., 2005;De Meester et al., 2005;Céréghino et al., 2008)',\n",
       " 'These small water bodies are known to house a rich tapestry of aquatic plant and macroinvertebrate species, even greater than that of other larger water bodies (e.g., lakes and rivers) (Biggs et al., 2005). Moreover, the high terrestrial and aquatic interchange of ponds may enable both small free-living (<1 µm) and large/particleassociated bacteria to proliferate (Søndergaard et al., 2005;Roiha et al., 2016). Therefore, assessing the microbial diversity and interactions of these complex water bodies is a critical first step with regard to completing a comprehensive characterization of pond biodiversity, and evaluating the suitability of pond freshwater for agricultural applications, such as the irrigation of food crops.',\n",
       " 'A growing body of literature has defined several bacterial phyla that are abundant in freshwater and markedly different from that of marine systems (Zwart et al., 2002;Newton et al., 2011). Previous studies have reported a widespread distribution of Actinobacteria (lineage acI and acIV) among various freshwater sites, in some cases composing greater than 50% of the total bacterial community abundance (Glöckner et al., 2000;Newton et al., 2011). The Proteobacteria phylum in freshwater is also abundant, composed largely of Betaproteobacteria. This is in contrast to marine systems where Alphaproteobacteria typically dominates (Newton et al., 2011)',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, aquatic microbial communities are influenced by a variety of seasonal factors, such as pH, temperature, and water retention time (Yannarell et al., 2003;Lindström et al., 2005), as well as top-down regulation from predators (e.g., bacteriophage) (Hennes et al., 1995;Chow et al., 2014). However, the majority of studies on the bacterial community composition of freshwater habitats come from large lakes and rivers, and very few have included an analysis of viral populations.',\n",
       " \"Bacteriophage, viruses that infect bacteria, are the most abundant biological entities in aquatic systems and play an important role in microbial community composition and ecology (Maranger and Bird, 1995;Wilhelm and Matteson, 2008). For instance, phage lysis results in the release of the host's internal cellular contents (e.g., organic carbon, nitrogen), which then becomes a part of the pool of dissolved organic material (DOM). This phenomenon, known as the viral shunt, increases the level of available DOM for other microbes and is suggested to promote bacterial respiration and growth (Wilhelm and Suttle, 1999;Suttle, 2007;Bonilla-Findji et al., 2008). Several studies have surveyed viral diversity through the use of widely, although not universally, distributed marker genes, such as polA\",\n",
       " 'Family A DNA polymerase, polA, which encodes the Pol I protein, is the principal polymerase for phage genome replication, and is suggested to be predictive of viral lifestyle based off a single amino acid substitution (Doublie et al., 1998;Schmidt et al., 2014;Wommack et al., 2015). A phenylalanine (wildtype) or tyrosine at amino acid position 762 (relative to Escherichia coli) is predictive of virulent phage (i.e., lytic replication), while a leucine substitution at this site seems to be predictive of a temperate lifestyle (i.e., lysogenic replication) (Schmidt et al., 2014). Other studies have surveyed viral communities and diversity through shotgun sampling of genomic DNA from viral concentrates (Wommack et al., 2015).',\n",
       " 'Similar to most bacterial analyses, the majority of studies of viral metagenomes (viromes) have been created from marine samples, which have provided astounding insights into how phage affect the ecology and biology of their hosts (Suttle, 2007;Rohwer and Thurber, 2009). In addition, there have been several viromes created from large freshwater lakes in the Artic (de Cárcer et al., 2015), the Antarctic (López-Bueno et al., 2009), France (Roux et al., 2012), North America (Djikeng et al., 2009;Green et al., 2015;Mohiuddin and Schellhorn, 2015;Watkins et al., 2016), and Ireland (Skvortsov et al., 2016)',\n",
       " 'While limited in their scope, these studies have provided some of the first data on freshwater phage ecology, demonstrating that, like their hosts, phage diversity is influenced by environmental factors. However, only a few studies have evaluated freshwater viromes from small lakes/ponds and fewer have looked at freshwater viromes in conjunction with a temporal analysis of fine scale host diversity (Fancello et al., 2013;Saxton et al., 2016).',\n",
       " 'Therefore, we aimed to assess the bacterial and viral components of a temperate agricultural pond in the Mid-Atlantic, United States during the late growing season (October-December), a time when declining temperature and nutrient levels may impact the structure and function of the microbial assemblages. Specifically, we used 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing to: (i) survey the bacterial consortium utilizing different filter pore sizes (1 and 0.2 µm); (ii) characterize the diversity and abundance of the bacteriophage within the viral community; and (iii) compare the phylogeny of pond viromes across time using the phylogenetically relevant, and biologically meaningful, Pol I protein.',\n",

       " 'The majority (93% October, 80% November, and 92% December) were Phage Elements, defined by the SEED subsystem hierarchy (Overbeek et al., 2005) as either \"Phages, Prophages, Transposable elements, \" which were largely phage structural genes (e.g., capsid, scaffolding) or \"Phages, Prophages, Transposable elements, and Plasmids, \" which were genes related to phage replication and packaging (e.g., terminase, integrase, helicase, primase). This was followed by \"Nucleosides & Nucleotides\" (4% October, 6% November, and 5% December), which were largely genes involved in ribonucleotide reduction.',\n",
       " '## Viral Marker Gene: Polymerase A A total of 842 confirmed Pol I peptides were extracted from our assembled pond water viromes (271 October, 320 November, and 251 December). From these, only 228 spanned the region of interest and were included in the phylogenic analysis: 68 in October, 83 in November, and 77 in December. The phylogenetic analysis (Figure 6) showed that the Pol I peptides grouped largely by their 762 position, whereas the sampling dates were distributed among the different clades. Again, to compare the Pol Is we calculated the normalized abundance for each. While the majority of Pol I peptides had the Leu substitution at the 762 site (184), followed by Tyr ( 27) and then the wildtype Phe (17), the clade at the highest abundance was those with the wildtype Phe mutation',\n",
       " 'Because this clade was so abundant, we used BLASTp to assess the top hit, which were uncultured bacteriophage from the Dry Tortugas surface water (Schmidt et al., 2014) and the seawater collected from the deep chlorophyll maximum of the Mediterranean Sea (Mizuno et al., 2013) (E value < 1e-300).',\n",
       " '## DISCUSSION While ponds represent a potential source of irrigation water, provided adequate filtering and monitoring technologies are employed, it is important to keep in mind their role in the ecosphere. Their small size and shallow depth enables a complex community of aquatic plants and macroinvertebrate species, as well as an interacting community of microorganisms.\\nHowever, changing water levels and anthropogenic factors associated with irrigation systems may interrupt the delicate balance of microbial life, which can ultimately impact higher trophic levels. Therefore, it is critical to carefully manage our use, or contamination, of these systems in search of irrigable water.',\n",
       " 'Here, the studied pond was dominated by Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes, common phyla found in most freshwater lakes (Newton et al., 2011). However, as the late season progressed there appeared to be changes in the bacterial community composition that correlated with specific environmental factors. For instance, Actinobacteria fluctuated throughout the sampling period, and was negatively correlated with the percentage of dissolved oxygen (Figure 1A and Supplementary Figure S1A). A previous study of the Luhuitou fringing coral reef also reported a negative correlation between dissolved oxygen and the abundance of several Actinobacteria species that may be due to their anaerobic capabilities (Kuang et al., 2015). This relationship may help to explain the fluctuations in freshwater Actinobacteria abundances and diversity described in other seasons (Allgaier and Grossart, 2006)',\n",
       " 'At a lower taxonomic level, the relative abundance of Synechococcus decreased significantly throughout the late season (Figure 1B and Supplementary Table S4). This is not surprising as the growth rate of Synechococcus is known to decrease with temperature and nitrogen levels, which occurred during the sampling period (Sakamoto andBryant, 1997, 1999).',\n",
       " 'While the changes in relative abundance described above were apparent in both filter fractions (1 and 2 µm), there were differences in alpha diversity, beta diversity, and core bacterial composition between the two fractions (Figures 123and Supplementary Figure S1). For instance, the 0.2 µm core microbiota was dominated by Actinobacteria, largely Actinomycetales ACK-M1, a known representative in most freshwater habitats (Van der Gucht et al., 2005) and free-living Proteobacteria, Limnohabitans, and Polynucleobacter, (Hahn et al., 2005(Hahn et al., , 2010;;Šimek et al., 2010) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3)',\n",
       " 'Whereas, the core of the 1 µm filter fraction was dominated by a diverse set of Proteobacteria, largely of the order Rhizobiales and Rhodobacteriales, previously found to dominate the particle-associated fraction in a marine pelagic trench (Eloe et al., 2011) (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure S3).',\n",
       " 'Furthermore, the bacterial richness was significantly higher in the 1 µm fraction in December and November (Figure 2). This suggests that the diversity of the large/attached bacteria recovered from the 1 µm filter were greater in the later months (November and December) compared to the smaller/free-living bacterial communities of the 0.2 µm filter. This increased diversity in the larger fraction agrees with studies investigating the differences between the particle-associated and free-living bacteria in other aquatic systems, such as the Baltic and Mediterranean Seas (Crespo et al., 2013;Rieck et al., 2015). While the alpha diversity trends were similar between the two filter fractions, the increasing richness was more prominent in the 1 µm filter fraction (Figure 2)',\n",
       " 'There can be several factors that may influence this discrepancy in temporal diversity, such as changing protozoan grazing rates and/or viral lysis impacting the microbial food web (Šimek et al., 1999;Hahn and Höfle, 2001;Weinbauer et al., 2007). Additionally, it can be suggested that the attached/large bacteria of the 1 µm fraction may have been better equipped to compete in an environment of decreased water temperature, nitrate, and chloride levels (Figure 1). In fact, previous studies have reported particleassociated bacteria have larger genomes compared to streamlined free-living bacteria (Smith et al., 2013). This reservoir of genetic material may allow for a more adaptive lifestyle in the face of changing conditions, competing bacterial populations and predators.',\n",
       " 'The viral fraction was dominated by sequences homologous to the tailed, double stranded DNA bacteriophage of the order Caudovirales (Figure 5A). Within the Caudovirales order, however, the family of generally temperate Siphoviruses was the most abundant at each time point (Figure 5A). This is in contrast to other freshwater systems, where Myoviruses and Podoviruses (Lakes Ontario, Erie, Matoaka, and Michigan (Fancello et al., 2013;Green et al., 2015;Mohiuddin and Schellhorn, 2015) were found to dominate. Conversely, Siphoviruses were reported to be abundant in sediments (Breitbart et al., 2004) and terrestrial subsurface environments (Edwards and Rohwer, 2005)',\n",
       " \"Siphovirus abundance within the pond water sampled here may reflect the pond's unique topology compared to larger lakes. Ponds and small lakes have a higher terrestrialaquatic interchange than larger freshwater systems due to their close contact with the adjacent terrestrial environment (Palik et al., 2001;Søndergaard et al., 2005). This large littoral zone may promote the influx of terrestrial/sediment Siphoviruses. Additionally, because the dominant lifecycle of cultured Siphoviruses (Suttle, 2005) is lysogenic, their abundance may be indicative of environmental stress, (e.g., changes in nutrients, pH or temperature) activating the lytic-lysogenic switch and thus increasing their presence in the free phage fraction (McDaniel et al., 2002). This agrees with the phylogenetic analysis of the informative viral marker gene family A DNA polymerase, polA (Pol I protein)\",\n",
       " 'In this case, the Pol I proteins were temporally persistent and dominated by the Leu762 mutation, suggested to be indicative of temperate phage (Figure 6) (Schmidt et al., 2014).',\n",
       " 'This abundance of temperate phage is important to note as they can alter the genetic architecture of their hosts, which can in turn influence the surrounding microbial community and environment. For instance, temperate phage can transduce bacterial DNA and potentially alter host biology, such as maintaining host photosynthesis during infection or encoding virulence and antibiotic resistance genes (Wagner and Waldor, 2002;Lindell et al., 2004;Balcazar, 2014). In this case, while present, genes involved in virulence/antimicrobial resistance were not enriched within the viral fraction during the study period (Figure 5B). However, the samples did contain a high abundance of genes involved in Nucleosides & Nucleotides production, largely ribonucleotide reduction genes',\n",
       " 'This is not surprising as ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) have been observed frequently within aquatic viral metagenomic libraries and namely in Myoviruses (Angly et al., 2006;Bench et al., 2007;Wommack et al., 2015).',\n",
       " 'From these data we were able to characterize the bacterial and viral taxonomic and functional components within an agricultural pond over time. In several cases, we observed the abundance of the dominant viral families correlated with the relative abundance of bacterial taxa. However, more work is necessary to track and model these interacting species. A more thorough analysis connecting phage with their hosts, such as through the use of the Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system, is warranted to provide a more nuanced assessment of their relationship in pond water and potential impact in the microbial food web (e.g., viral shunt). Additionally, other parameters like phosphate, dissolved organic carbon, chlorophyll concentration, and protozoan grazing rates might also exert some influence on the temporal dynamics observed here and should be included in future studies of freshwater ponds. Overall, this analysis serves as a baseline of the diversity and dynamics of three distinct microbial fractions in agricultural pond water.',\n",

       " '# The importance of small waterbodies for biodiversity and ecosystem services: implications for policy makers\\n## Abstract',\n",
       " 'Small waterbodies, including ponds and small lakes, low-order streams, ditches and springs, are the most numerous freshwater environments globally, are critical for freshwater biodiversity and are increasingly recognised for their role in ecosystem service delivery. Small waters often represent the best remaining examples of intact freshwater habitats and are the most likely to remain unpolluted, often being a refuge for species which have disappeared from larger, more damaged, waterbodies. Practically all waterrelated ecosystem services are initially mediated by small waters and some, such as carbon cycling, may be dominated by them. Small waters are exposed to all the threats affecting larger waters, and some experienced only by small waters. Despite this, small waters remain the least investigated part of the water environment and are largely excluded from water management planning. We identify the priorities for research to underpin better protection of small waters and recommend policy actions needed to better integrate small waters into the management of catchments and landscapes',\n",
       " 'The primary requirements are to identify reliable monitoring programmes for small waters, develop effective measures to protect the biodiversity and ecosystem services they provide and ensure that regulators take full account of this critical part of the water environment.',\n",
       " '## Introduction There is growing awareness of the importance of small waterbodies in terms of their abundance, importance for freshwater biodiversity, role in contributing to ecosystem services and their sensitivity and vulnerability to anthropogenic disturbances (Williams et al., 2004;Downing et al., 2006;Verdonschot et al., 2011;Bartout et al., 2015;US EPA, 2015). At the same time, there is a recognised lack of knowledge on the functioning of small waters to effectively inform policy and practice measures to protect them (Cereghino et al., 2008;Kelly-Quinn & Baars, 2014). This has led to a range of recent initiatives aiming to highlight the importance of small waters and encourage interactions between scientists, policy makers, practitioners and others with interests in their protection and management (e.g',\n",
       " 'Meyer et al., 2007a;Anon 2012;Biggs et al., 2014a;Kelly-Quinn & Baars, 2014). Better understanding, and more effective management, of small waters has considerable potential to help address some of the many threats to freshwater ecosystems, and the services they provide, summarised by Dudgeon et al. (2006) and Vo ¨ro ¨smarty et al. (2010). This paper seeks to refocus attention on small waters by drawing together the key literature on what constitutes small waters, their extent, importance, vulnerability and threats they face, and to evaluate the main fundamental and practical knowledge gaps',\n",
       " 'Reflecting the concerns of Strayer and Dudgeon (2010), we aim to stimulate practical action by encouraging rational planning of responses to climate change and other threats to freshwater ecosystems, to stimulate freshwater conservationists to act now to prevent further losses of species and habitats, particularly by working with small waters, and to bridge the gap between freshwater ecology and conservation biology. We particularly encourage researchers who have substantially increased our fundamental understanding of freshwaters through the use of small waters as model systems (e.g. De Meester et al., 2005;Hildrew, 2009) to continue emphasising to policy makers and practitioners the importance of the waterbodies themselves, not simply as surrogates for something bigger and, by implication, more important.',\n",
       " 'Previous reviews of small waters have typically focussed on single waterbody types, considering either running or standing waters (e.g. Clarke et al., 2008;Oertli et al., 2009;Downing 2010;Larned et al., 2010;Dollinger et al., 2015). Here we consider all types of small waters, both running and still, to highlight the commonalities of structure and function, and the concepts of relevance to policy makers which apply to all kinds of small waterbodies. As far as possible, we have attempted to evaluate all relevant recent information but this inevitably leads to some imbalances in coverage. Although small waters have been neglected generally, more information is available about ponds, small lakes and headwater streams than for springs and, especially, ditches, which have only begun to attract detailed attention quite recently',\n",
       " 'Acknowledging the gaps in available data, recommendations are made for policy makers and legislators to increase the effectiveness of management of these habitats, with particular reference to the European Water Framework Directive and Habitats Directive as examples (European Commission, 2000, 2002).',\n",
       " \"## Definitions 'Small waterbodies' is an ambiguous term with, as yet, no universally accepted or legal definition. In this paper, we use the term to refer to ponds and small lakes, small streams including headwaters, ditches and springs. In the following section, the approaches which have been taken to derive these definitions are described.\",\n",
       " '## Ponds and small lakes Ponds are small standing waters varying in size from 1 m 2 to about 2-5 ha in area and may be permanent or seasonal, man-made or naturally created (Pond Conservation Group, 1993;Collinson et al., 1995;Biggs et al., 2007;E.P.C.N., 2007;Cereghino et al., 2008). Although there is a long history, dating back to the nineteenth century, of attempts to define the difference between a pond and a lake (Biggs et al., 2005), large ponds and small lakes share many characteristics in terms of structure and function, and the transition zone between the two types of habitat is very gradual (Søndergaard et al., 2005;De Meester et al., 2005)',\n",
       " \"Indeed, ponds merge imperceptibly into virtually all other freshwater habitat types (Biggs et al., 1997). However, for practical purposes, such as estimating waterbody numbers or comparing waterbody types, most authors have adopted a size-based classification with a size boundary somewhere between 1 and 5 ha, which can be fairly easily measured in the field (e.g. Williams et al., 2004;Kalettka & Rudat, 2006;Davies et al., 2008a, b;De Bie et al., 2008;Williams et al., 2010a). Occasionally, 'pond' studies are restricted to waters of no more than 0.5 ha (e.g. Lafitte et al., 2009) or extended to include those up to 8 m in depth or 10 ha in area (e.g\",\n",
       " 'Oertli et al., 2000Oertli et al., , 2005)). The Ramsar Convention adopted a cut-off between ponds and lakes of 8 ha, although in practice this has not been widely applied by workers investigating these',\n",
       " '## Small streams The term small stream is perhaps the most ambiguous of all and is often used interchangeably with the term headwater, with no clear consensus on a definition of either. Furthermore, as noted by Moore & Richardson (2003) not all small streams are headwaters. Despite this, most small streams probably lie within headwater reaches. Headwater streams have been defined by Furse et al. (1993) as the length of stream within 2.5 km from the source, most often encompassing zero-, first-or second-order watercourses (e.g. Meyer et al., 2007a;Callanan et al., 2008a;Clarke et al., 2008;Barmuta et al., 2009;Finn et al., 2011), although some European headwater studies have extended to third-order streams (Dunbar et al., 2010) and may be located in lowland or upland areas',\n",
       " 'Some small coastal streams are first-and at most second-order channels for their entire length which often extends to just a few kilometres (Whelan, 2014).',\n",
       " 'So is there an all-encompassing definition of small streams? In a workshop held in Carlingford, Northern Ireland, in 2010, steam order, width and flow were considered as potentially defining small streams, and although no definition was derived, it was generally agreed that width was the most easily measured and, when combined with stream order, widths would vary from \\\\3 to 6 m (Anon, 2012). The same workshop proposed that priority be given to streams with widths \\\\1.5 m because of their vulnerability to anthropogenic impact. Barmuta et al. (2009) presented similar discussion on what constituted headwater streams and adopted a working definition which included zero-and first-order, and where necessary, second-order stream segments but within a maximum catchment area of about two square kilometres',\n",
       " 'As noted by Richardson & Danehy (2007), the best accepted definition of a headwater at a meeting convened by the Oregon Headwater Research Cooperative was based on widths (\\\\3 m) and mean annual discharge (\\\\57 l/s), although the latter was recognised as problematic. The term headwater system was used by Gomi et al. (2002) which they described as containing four topographic units (hillslopes, zeroorder basins, temporary or transitional channels and first-and second-order streams), each differing in biological and hydrological processes. They proposed that the largest catchment of headwater systems is likely to be 1 km 2 , but these systems are probably better defined by hydrologic, geomorphic and biological processes rather than simply catchment area. The latter definition might capture short coastal streams whose total stream length may be less than 3 km. These are often extremely numerous in coastal areas with fringing uplands, e.g. Ireland',\n",
       " 'In the Water Framework Directive, small linear headwaters are those with catchments less than 10 km 2 . Overall, the term headwater is probably the most useful and most widely used to capture the location of the smallest stream elements, including intermittent streams. However, the precise definition and spatial extent of headwater will be regionally variable. Furthermore, it will depend on the scale of mapping data and where one selects the start of the stream, which can vary seasonally and with land use (e.g. Montgomery & Dietrich, 1989;Hanson, 2001;MacDonald & Coe, 2007). The term headwater is generally used in the studies cited throughout this paper.',\n",
       " \"## Ditches In the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, studies by Williams and colleagues (Williams et al., 2004;Biggs et al., 2007;Davies et al., 2008a, b;Biggs et al., 2014b) and others (Shaw et al., 2015;Hill et al., 2016) comparing ditches to other freshwater habitats have used a definition of the habitat first proposed in Williams et al. (2004): 'Man-made channels created primarily for agricultural purposes, and which usually: (i) have a linear planform, (ii) follow linear field boundaries, often turning at right angles, and (iii) showing little relationship with natural landscape contours'. In the UK landscape, the majority of ditches are 1-3 m wide, with only a small proportion narrower or wider than this (Brown et al., 2006)\",\n",
       " 'A survey of the ditch network by Shore et al. (2015) in two agricultural catchments in the southeast of Ireland recorded an average width of 2.3 m and depth of 1.1 m, and cross-sections that were generally U-shaped or trapezoidal.',\n",
       " 'Although ditches occur in all kinds of humanmodified environments where land drainage is needed, they have only been the subject of limited investigation as freshwater habitats (e.g. Scheffer et al., 1984;Higler & Verdonschot, 1989;Painter, 1999;Williams et al., 2004;Verdonschot et al., 2011). Despite this, ditches in some areas are of exceptional importance for freshwater biodiversity, normally because they retain patches of clean water in otherwise drained long-established wetland environments. In England, for example, there are currently 74 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), areas designated by the government as being of high importance for nature conservation, with lowland ditches identified as one of the reasons that the site has legal protection (Clarke, 2015)',\n",
       " 'Most of these are found within the approximately 31,000 ha of coastal and floodplain grazing marsh habitat protected within SSSIs, but as ditches can occur in other land uses there is not complete overlap. Typically, these high-value systems occur in Land Classes 1 and 2 identified by Brown et al. (2006).',\n",
       " \"Here they may be important biodiversity refuges especially where more 'natural' waterbodies are exposed to near-universal water pollution. Consequently, they have been valued by nature conservation organisations since the late 1970s (Drake et al., 2010;Clarke, 2015) when their value was first initially appreciated.\",\n",
       " \"## Springs Hydrologically, springs are defined as strictly delimited places where the groundwater emerges at the surface (Cantonati et al., 2006). They can also be seen as points of natural, concentrated discharge of groundwater, at a rate high enough to maintain flow on the surface (van Everdingen, 1991). The German Institute for Norms (DIN) precisely defines a spring as a ''spatially restricted groundwater emergence, which at least temporally leads to a superficial discharge'' (DIN, 1994). This definition also includes anthropogenically modified springs such as wells. Geohydrological spring types, such as overflow springs or artesian springs, are distinguished depending on the geology and the characteristics of the aquifer (Martin et al., 2015)\",\n",
       " 'In general, the aquifer is the storage body of water gained by precipitation and lost by spring flow after a certain time lag (Glazier, 2014). Depending on the geology, storage times in the aquifer differ considerably from a few hours to over 10,000 years (Glazier, 2014).',\n",
       " 'From an ecological perspective, springs are ecotones at the interface between surface water and groundwater (Webb et al., 1998;Cantonati et al., 2006). Since the start of spring research at the beginning of the twentieth century, it has almost been a paradigm that springs are stable habitats providing the biota, such as macroinvertebrates, with relatively constant abiotic conditions (e.g. Thienemann, 1926;Nielsen, 1950). Thermal stability in particular was identified as a key factor characterising springs fed by deep groundwater (e.g. Illies, 1952;Minshall, 1968;van der Kamp, 1995). More recent spring research has revealed doubts about this apparent stability (Fischer et al., 1998;Gra ¨sle & Beierkuhnlein, 1999)',\n",
       " 'However, at least for lowland springs and springs in low mountain ranges, low temperature variability indeed seems to be an indicator for separating the springhead, the actual spring, from the adjacent springbrook (Erman & Erman, 1995;Von Fumetti et al., 2007).',\n",
       " '## Extent and abundance of small waterbodies ## Ponds and small lakes Ponds and small lakes are globally abundant habitats (Downing et al., 2006;Downing, 2010). However, there is currently considerable controversy about their numbers, mainly owing to difficulties in estimating the numbers of small ponds (Bartout et al., 2015). As the significance of small standing waterbodies has become increasingly clear, the ability to estimate their abundance reliably has become more important',\n",
       " 'However, current suggestions for global abundance of standing waters vary by more than an order of magnitude with low estimates ranging from 64 and 100 million (respectively, McDonald et al., 2012;Bartout et al., 2015) to c.300 million (Downing et al., 2006), c.500 million (Holgerson & Raymond, 2016) and about 3 billion (Oertli & Frossard, 2013). Bartout et al. (2015) suggest that the higher estimates are unlikely. However, they consider waterbodies only down to 100 m 2 and in some regions (e.g',\n",

Ponds and small lakes outnumber large lakes roughly 100:1 (Downing et al., 2006;Cereghino et al., 2008). In Europe as a whole, it is likely that there are between 5 and 10 million small lakes and ponds and in the United States about 17 million ponds up to 1 ha in area (McDonald et al., 2012) although the latter total excludes waters less than 1000 m 2 so underestimate the true number.',\n",

Downing et al. (2006) originally suggested that the area of lakes and ponds up to 10 ha was about 30% of the global total standing water area. Although more conservative estimates are probably appropriate (e.g. Holgerson & Raymond, 2016), it is clear that small standing waters make an important contribution to the global total freshwater area.',\n",

In the United Kingdom, where ditch densities have been calculated for both lowland and upland landscapes, using data presented by Brown et al.

Glazier (2014) gave a comprehensive review of the number of springs all over the world. As an approximate estimate, there are thought to be over 43,000,000 springs worldwide. Certain geographical ''hotspots'' for springs can be distinguished. In alpine regions such as the Alps, but also the South Island of New Zealand, spring density is high.

In New Zealand, 1400 springs were recorded in an area of 42,200 km 2 (Barquin & Scarsbrook, 2008). Lowland areas still strongly influenced by the last glacial period are also rich in springs: for northeastern Germany, the presence of more than 10,000 springs has been estimated in an area of 29,000 km 2 (Kru ¨ger, 1996)',\n",

(2000a) used macroinvertebrate data to group ponds into 16 categories in which permanence, pH and hydrology were the dominant driving environmental variables (Fig. 1). In Switzerland, Oertli et al. (2000) identified between 4 and 7 pond types, depending on the biotic groups (amphibians, macrophytes, dragonflies, molluscs, water beetles) used to characterise types. Martens et al. (2008), working in Belgium, showed that pond assemblage composition was driven mainly by the presence of fish and macrophytes, with water turbidity and sediment quality also being important influences. Water quality in turn was influenced by the presence of trampling cattle, and probably broader land-use factors. However, the classification of ponds is complicated by their acknowledged heterogeneity, which is greater than that seen in the running water network',\n",
       " 'Although this heterogeneity is most apparent in studies comparing different waterbody types (e.g. Williams et al., 2004;Biggs et al., 2014b;De Bie et al., 2008), it may also explain the conclusion of Batzer (2013) working on North American wetlands that little consensus has so far emerged about how environmental factors influence invertebrate communities.',\n",
       " \"Although it has traditionally been assumed that ponds are 'isolated islands in a sea of dry land', they clearly form networks linked by physical and biological processes, not just with other ponds but with all other kinds of freshwater habitat. This is reflected in the fact that, at least in north temperate environments, a large proportion of the freshwater species in any landscape is found in a range of waterbody types, including both still and flowing waters. For example, in the landscape of southern England (Williams et al., 2004) (Fig. 2, unpublished data) found that in a stratified random sample of ponds, rivers, streams and ditches, of 230 aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa recorded, 33% were found only in ponds, 32% only in rivers and 45% in both ponds and rivers\",\n",

In some instances, these typologies specifically identify 'small' lake types (e.g. Duigan et al. 2007), whereas others treat small lakes as part of a continuum. Wellborn et al. (1996) suggested some years ago that studies of standing waters on size gradients from small to large would be of general value, but until quite recently most work was still concentrated on relatively large waterbodies, with few studies specifically concerned with whether or not there are significant differences between small and large lakes.

(2016) noted that, for algae, some prefer what these authors called 'small habitats', some 'middlesized' and some 'large habitats'. At present, there remains little information with which to assess whether small lakes really are different, or to explore more complex ideas of relevance to practitioners such as: Are small lakes easier to protect from damaging impacts than larger lakes? To what extent do interactions between lakes and other waterbodies affect their ecology? Which processes differ in small and large lakes, and which are similar?\",\n",
       " '## Types of small streams Within the small stream or headwater network, channel types or features are likely to be highly variable due to differences in geomorphic, hydrological, precipitation and ecological conditions (Gomi et al., 2002), thus leading to the heterogeneity that is typical of small stream networks. There have been some attempts to classify small streams on the basis of some or all of these conditions. They have been classified in terms of flow duration into perennial, intermittent and ephemeral, with the latter two often collectively being called temporary streams. Intermittent streams do not flow for certain parts of a year, whereas ephemeral streams typically only flow during  2004). Species identities, from 1 to 227, are shown in Online Resource Table 1 storm events (Hanson, 2001;Meyer et al., 2007a, b). Datry et al. (2014) included ephemeral streams in their definition of intermittent streams',\n",

McDonagh et al. (2011) synthesised available information on temporary streams, describing them as the most abundant, widely distributed and dynamic freshwater ecosystem on Earth. They presented reported estimates of their global representation ranging from 60% to [70% of river networks. According to Datry et al. (2014), most Arctic, Alpine and Antarctic streams are intermittent. In a study by Hanson (2001), the Chattooga stream network was estimated to have 28% perennial, 17% intermittent and 55% ephemeral streams. Sa ´nchez-Montoya et al',\n",

Scoring systems to distinguish intermittent, ephemeral and perennial streams, incorporating a range of geomorphic and biological indicators, have been employed in some areas (e.g. NCDWQ, 2010). Regardless of how they are classified, intermittent streams, as outlined by Larned et al. (2010), are characterised by hydrological discontinuities with advancing and retreating wetted fronts which have consequences for aquatic communities and biogeochemical processes. These vary both spatially and temporally and are determined by local climatic and topographical factors.',\n",

Typological classification within the context of the European Water Framework Directive has generally excluded headwater streams because their catchment size falls below 10 km 2 . Consequently, within Europe there have been few attempts to define types of headwaters apart from the work of Furse (2000) in the UK, Heino et al.

       " 'With the exception of Triest (2006) working on macrophytes, the classifications were based on macroinvertebrates. The site groupings based on macroinvertebrates were largely due to differences in site elevation, stream geology and its effect on pH, and to a lesser extent substrate type. However, in some areas there were high degrees of overlap among assemblage types (Heino et al., 2003a). Furthermore, Paavola et al. (2003) noted in their work in Finland that community classifications in headwater streams are not concordant across taxonomic groups and care should be taken when the results based on one taxonomic group are extrapolated to other groups to create typologies.',\n",

Drake et al. (2010) focussing specifically on the ditch systems of drained fen landscapes near the English and Welsh coast (Fig. 3) identified seven main botanical assemblages with a clear distinction between vegetation dominated by floating duckweed species and the more species-rich vegetation typified by the presence of Frogbit (Hydrocharis morsus-ranae L.) and Ivy-leaved duckweed (Lemna trisulca L.)',\n",

Invertebrate classifications were influenced by the pronounced east-west preference of some species in their national distribution but it was not possible to derive a classification that was robust for the entire spectrum of ditch types at a national scale, perhaps reflecting a greater heterogeneity in invertebrate assemblages. Water conductivity and pH, ditch dimensions, water depth, vegetation structure, the presence/absence of algae and grazing were the most important environmental factors influencing invertebrate assemblages. However, the study did not include laboratory analysis of water chemistry so it may have underestimated the role of pollution caused by excess nutrients, sediments or biocides in shaping assemblages. In the Netherlands, Verdonschot (1990) found eleven ditch assemblage types in the Overijjsel Province based on aquatic macroinvertebrates',\n",

       " '## Types of springs At the beginning of the twentieth century, three principal eco-morphological spring types were differentiated by Steinmann (1915) and Thienemann (1922). The so-called rheocrenes are characterised by a single point of outflow where the outflow stream is formed immediately and is dominated by coarse inorganic substrates (Hahn, 2000). Helocrenes are swampy springs, where the water seeps out of the ground at several points. Such lentic springs are dominated by fine organic and inorganic substrates (Von Fumetti & Nagel, 2011). Limnocrenes occur when the groundwater emerges in a natural basin. The basin is first filled with spring water before the water runs off. Helocrenes and limnocrenes mainly occur in the North European Lowlands',\n",
       " 'Here, they can reach large spatial extents and a high density (Lindegaard et al., 1998;Ilmonen & Paasivirta, 2005;Martin & Brunke, 2012). In low mountain ranges such as the Palatine forest in Central Europe and the Swiss Jura Mountains, rheocrenes and rheohelocrenes dominate (Hahn, 2000;Ku ¨ry, 2013). In high alpine areas, large spring bogs, but also many, partly steep, rheocrenes typically occur. Combined rheocrenes and helocrenes are known as rheohelocrene (Schwoerbel, 1959). In natural alluvial river floodplains, alluvial springs are common',\n",
       " \"They occur where alluvial groundwater is upwelling owing to geologic constraints (Zollho ¨fer et al., 2000). They usually exhibit low discharge variability and are characterised by extremely clear water, promoting the growth of submerged macrophytes. In springs with pronounced karst characteristics, discharge strongly depends on precipitation in the catchment area. Such karstic rheocrenes tend to dry out in summer and can then be described as intermittent. In limestone-dominated regions, so-called ''limestone-precipitating springs'' (LPS, Cantonati et al., 2016) are quite often found. They can be ecomorphologically impressive with large calcite terraces, but are faunistically poor\",\n",
       " 'The differentiation of spring types in the field is, however, critical and intermediate types or transitions from one type to the other are often much more frequent (Von Fumetti et al., 2006;Cantonati et al., 2006;Martin & Brunke, 2012).The eco-morphological appearance of springs strongly depends on the slope and the underlying geology. The differentiation of cold water and hot water springs is hydrologically and ecologically relevant. The latter occur in high frequency, e.g., in New Zealand (Tillyard, 1920), but also in North America (Meffe & Marsh, 1983;Hayford & Herrmann, 1998), India (Jana, 1973) and China (Keshi, 1980)',\n",
       " 'In desert regions, such as the Sonoran Desert or the Great Basin, the existence of cold water springs is especially remarkable (Myers & Resh, 2002). Naturally, the ecology of thermal springs differs clearly from that of cooler, non-thermal springs (Glazier, 2014). Water chemistry is another feature for classifying springs. For example, the extent of salinity is an important characteristic of a spring (Williams & Williams, 1996;Hahn, 2000). Owing to high salinity and high water temperatures, some springs are used for the health benefits they provide. The various approaches to classifying springs are reviewed by Glazier (2014).',\n",

A wide range of studies have now confirmed that, particularly for macrophytes, aquatic micro-and macroinvertebrates and amphibians, small waterbodies are areas of high biodiversity. Thus, although individual small waters have lower average a diversity than larger waters, at regional level small waters, especially ponds and small lakes, typically have high c diversity (Williams et al., 2004;Clarke et al., 2008)',\n",
       " 'The possible explanations of this high inherent richness are as follows: (i) the history and temporal abundance of small waters; in most landscapes and over long geological periods, it seems likely that small waterbodies have been the numerically dominant freshwater habitat type, commonly available to freshwater organisms able to move between temporally dynamic habitat patches, (ii) the physico-chemical heterogeneity of small waters, which is typically greater than that for larger waterbodies (Williams et al., 2004;Demars & Edwards, 2007;Gooderham et al., 2007;Lischeid & Kalettka, 2012) and (iii) in the contemporary environment, the more frequent occurrence of near-natural conditions, especially freedom from pollution, in small waters (Freshwater Habitats Trust, unpublished data).',\n",
       " \"It has been suggested that the patchy and comparatively isolated nature of freshwater habitats, particularly compared to the sea, should promote greater speciation rates than open oceans. Support for this idea comes from recent studies which have highlighted the surprisingly high species richness of freshwater habitats, which are nearly equal to marine environments despite their much smaller area (*2% of Earth's surface vs. 70% for marine habitats) (Wiens, 2015). If isolation is an important driver of species richness in freshwaters, the very large proportion of small waters that comprise freshwater ecosystems may make an important contribution to this pattern.\",\n",
       " 'The heterogeneity of small waters is well documented and in part this reflects their small catchments: small waterbodies are strongly affected by local conditions (e.g. wooded or open surrounds, heavily or lightly grazed grassland, acid or neutral chemistry), which leads to considerable variation between waterbodies in physical and chemical characteristics, compared with larger waterbodies (e.g. Williams et al., 2004;Demars & Edwards, 2007).',\n",
       " \"Small waterbodies, both still and flowing, are also now an important 'refuge' for clean water ecosystems in many landscapes, especially in those areas where agriculture and urbanisation represent a substantial portion of land use. As a consequence of their small catchments, where small waters occur in pockets of semi-natural habitat, they can remain near-pristine (e.g. Feeley & Kelly-Quinn, 2012). In contrast, larger waterbodies, with their extensive catchments, are almost inevitably subject to pollution and other impacts except in the most pristine landscapes. As a result, small waters are often amongst the least damaged freshwaters in the areas where they have been investigated.\",\n",
       " 'The protection of small waterbodies and the biodiversity they support is a concern. For example, in the EU, the Water Framework Directive in theory is intended to protect all waters. However, in the delineation and selection of waterbodies, many Member States have used size thresholds that exclude small waterbodies without necessarily taking into account their importance in the basin (EC, 2012). Some Member States have explicitly included smaller waterbodies if they are protected under other legislation or if they are ecologically important in the basin. In Europe, several priority habitat types recognised in the Habitats Directive occur extensively in ponds (Keeble et al., 2009) but, in practice and with the exception of Mediterranean temporary ponds, most EU states only protect or monitor large examples of these priority habitats, i.e. lakes (EEA, 2012;EC, 2012, pp. 72-73)',\n",
       " \"Also in Europe, although ponds are recognised as 'stepping stone' habitats in the Habitats Directives, most states have made limited efforts to maintain the extent or quality of these stepping stones. In North America, recent attempts have also been made to bring small waters more into the regulatory system, although as yet it is too early to judge success (US EPA, 2015).\",\n",

'Single Large Or Several Small' analyses (SLOSS) have also shown that ponds support more species and a higher conservation value than lakes of the same total area (Oertli et al., 2002;Martinez-Sanz et al., 2012). A number of studies show that ponds are particularly important for endangered species, supporting a similar or higher portion of endangered species than rivers or lakes\",\n",

These findings implied that small lakes made an important contribution to freshwater biodiversity in the landscapes studied and are probably typical of small lakes generally (e.g. Scheffer et al., 2006;Mosscrop et al., 2015).',\n",

(2007b) presented an overview of the importance of headwater streams for biodiversity and placed the aquatic biota in four categories which included species that are unique to this part of the river network, species that occur there but also in larger rivers, species that move into headwaters seasonally and those that migrate there to complete particular life history stages (e.g. salmonids for spawning). Interestingly, recruitment from the aforementioned small coastal streams may be important for the maintenance of sea trout fisheries in neighbouring coastal areas (Whelan, 2014). A fifth grouping proposed by Meyer et al. (2007b) included species that live near these streams in semi-aquatic or riparian habitats.',\n",

The significant contribution of headwaters to regional biodiversity was highlighted in the globalscale study of Finn et al.

Indeed, Heino et al. (2003b) drew attention to the role of regional factors in structuring headwater communities, which in part is attributed to their highly heterogeneous environments (Furse, 2000;Heino et al., 2003a;Lowe and Likens 2005;Clarke et al., 2008;Callanan et al., 2014).

(2007) in a study characterising wetland plant and macroinvertebrate biodiversity in all widespread freshwater habitat types (ponds, lakes, rivers, streams and ditches) found that ditches in floodplain and coastal environments supported the most species-rich plant and animal assemblages. Webb et al',\n",
       " \"(2010) in a literature review of aquatic species habitat requirements in England showed that there were 47 UK Biodiversity Action Plan species associated with ditches in coastal and floodplain grazing marshes compared with 77 species for ponds, 40 for lakes and 76 for rivers. Away from flat, low-lying, coastal and floodplain landscapes, in 'ordinary' farmed environments, ditch systems resemble other parts of the headwater network and are often subject to significant pollution (e.g. Biggs et al., 2014b). Even here, however, there is some evidence that they can provide a useful biodiversity resource (Williams et al., 2004).\",\n",
       " \"Although it has long been known that ditches can be critical freshwater habitats in areas with lowintensity grassland agriculture, it is also increasingly clear that, even in intensively cultivated drained wetlands, they can support a range of species of conservation concern in areas that might superficially be regarded as 'arable deserts' (Graham & Hammond, 2015). They may also be dispersal corridors for water plants otherwise restricted to nature reserves (Favre-Bac et al., 2016).\",\n",
       " 'Elsewhere in Europe (Ireland, Denmark, Germany, France), ditch systems have been found to be similar to (Davies et al., 2008a, b;Verdonschot et al., 2011) or exceed (Kavanagh & Harrison, 2014) streams, in a or c diversity, and to support similar numbers of endangered species to semi-natural small lakes (Verdonschot et al., 2011). In North America, studies of ditches are still at an early stage but work in Florida (Simon & Travis, 2011) confirms that they can make a similar contribution to regional freshwater biodiversity to that seen in Europe. Away from floodplains, where many ditches are seasonal, they are often more impoverished, but even these seasonal ditches may support uncommon species not recorded in other waterbody types at regional level (Williams et al., 2004)',\n",

       " '## Spring biodiversity Due to their ecotonal character, springs are inhabited by species of different ecotonal areas: spring specialists restricted to springheads, the so-called crenobionts, co-exist with species also occurring in springbrooks (i.e. crenophiles). Groundwater-associated stygobiont species, species occurring in adjacent streams (i.e. rhithrobionts) and species adapted to the transition zone between land and water, also occur. Water temperature has traditionally been identified as the key factor determining the close relationship between crenobionts and springs (e.g. Erman & Erman, 1995) with characteristic species amongst the water mites, certain dipteran families and mosses (Cantonati et al., 2006)',\n",
       " 'Recently, evidence has been found for other environmental factors of equal importance to thermal stability for crenobiosis, with substrate diversity and spatial heterogeneity seeming to especially enhance spring biodiversity (Bonettini & Cantonati, 1996;Hahn, 2000;Von Fumetti et al., 2006;Cantonati et al., 2012).',\n",
       " 'Despite usually low alpha diversity in springs, beta diversity is high due to heterogeneous faunistic assemblages. Their contribution to regional biodiversity must not be underestimated (Gerecke et al., 2011;Wigger et al., 2015). Regionally, springs can collectively be seen as hotspots of biodiversity (Cantonati et al., 2012). For example, more than 500 macroinvertebrate taxa were found in 792 springs in Kalkalpen National Park (121,1998). In the 1970s, 1500 aquatic animal species associated with springs were described for Europe, a third of them being crenobionts or crenophiles (Zollho ¨fer, 1997). Spring biodiversity is strongly influenced by geology and altitude',\n",
       " 'Hard-water springs are dominated by noninsect taxa such as amphipods and snails, whereas in soft-water springs insect taxa dominate (Glazier, 1991). Along an altitudinal gradient, springs below the treeline are dominated by shredders and collectors and springs above the treeline are dominated by scrapers (Wigger et al., 2015). Species richness seems to decrease with altitude (Wigger et al., 2015). Overall, springs are excellent experimental outdoor laboratories as they are of small spatial extent, hydrologically stable and ecologically simple. This was realised by Odum (1957), who conducted the first holistic study of an aquatic ecosystem in Silver Springs, Florida.',\n",
       " '## Small waterbodies for terrestrial species As well as providing habitats for aquatic organisms, small waterbodies are often an important part of the matrix of habitats used by terrestrial organisms. For example, farmland birds and pollinating insects may make use of ponds in agricultural environments (Davies et al., 2016;Stewart et al., 2016), and bats make use of ponds, small lakes in a wide variety of environments and intermittent streams (Freshwater Habitats Trust, 2012;Seidman & Zabel, 2001). A range of non-aquatic plants and animals depend upon (technically, are obligate users of) the riparian zones of small forest headwater streams (Richardson et al., 2005)',\n",
       " 'As these small patches of habitat often seem less significant than large habitat patches, reflecting the normal alpha diversity/gamma diversity contrast of large and small habitats, the role of smaller waterbodies for terrestrial species generally has received less attention than for larger waters.',\n",
       " \"## Small waterbodies and ecosystem services Ecosystem services are most commonly defined as 'the benefits people obtain from ecosystems' or 'the contributions that ecosystems make to human wellbeing', based on the MEA (2005) report or the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services report (Haines-Young & Potschin, 2013), respectively. Four main categories of ecosystem services have been recognised: (1) provisioning, (2) regulating and maintenance, (3) cultural and (4) a range of supporting processes (also referred to as supporting or intermediate services), which underpin the services of the first three categories (Table 2). To avoid double counting, the latter is not considered in the valuation of ecosystem services. Apart from providing water to sustain life on earth, freshwater habitats provide a wide range of other benefits to human well-being. The contribution of small waterbodies is likely to be particularly high but poorly quantified\",\n",
       " 'Here, we highlight the key provisioning, regulating and maintenance, and cultural ecosystem services that have been highlighted within the literature and refer to others that are likely to be important but have not been considered.',\n",
       " '## Provisioning services The material or energy outputs from ecosystems such as water for domestic and non-domestic use, fish, fibre or other renewable materials\\n\\n## Regulating and maintenance services The various ways in which living organisms can mediate or moderate the ambient environment. For example, they provide for water quality by removing excess nutrients and degrading waste and toxic substances through biological processes Cultural services\\nThe non-material benefits people obtain from contact with ecosystems such as recreation, sense of place, spiritual and educational value',\n",
       " '## Intermediate services Supporting processes a These underpin almost all other services. In fresh waters they relate to all levels of aquatic biodiversity from genetics to community diversity, primary production and other ecosystem processes and functions which occur in well-functioning ecosystems and support their resilience to internal and external pressures a Also known as supporting services and habitat services',\n",
       " 'As fundamental ecological understanding of ponds and small lakes has grown, awareness of their role in providing ecosystem services has also developed. Three areas are of particular importance: pollution control, carbon cycling and small-scale water supply. There is an extensive worldwide literature on the role of natural and constructed small standing waters in pollution control, which have been extensively investigated (e.g. Braskerud, 2002;Vymazal, 2011;Tournebize et al., 2016). These studies show that pond systems are able to retain nutrients, although with substantial variations in efficiency depending on geology, soils, topography, hydrology, season and climate. At present, it is unclear to what extent such systems reduce pollutant loads generally, although evidence suggests that the gains at catchment and landscape scale are so far modest (e.g',\n",
       " 'Ockenden et al., 2012;Dı ´az et al., 2012;Arheimer & Pers, 2016). In terms of carbon cycling, understanding of the role of ponds and small lakes is growing rapidly at present, reflecting the awareness of the intensity of geochemical process in small waters and their abundance which appears to give them a role disproportionate to their physical extent. Thus, Downing et al. (2008) proposed that, globally, ponds trapped as much carbon as the ocean, a striking suggestion which has prompted substantial interest in the role of small waters in the carbon cycle. However, there is increasing evidence that certain conditions in small standing waters can lead to elevated methane emissions and the need to develop greater understanding of this disadvantage of small waters in regulating carbon should be noted. For example, ponds in the Arctic permafrost can contribute three quarters of landscape-level carbon dioxide emissions (Abnizova et al., 2012)',\n",
       " 'Similarly, Holgerson & Raymond (2016) report substantial emissions of methane from very small ponds, which are also the most abundant type of waterbody. As yet, it remains unclear whether burial of carbon first highlighted by Downing et al. (2008) compensates for the high rates of the production of CO 2 and other greenhouse gases from ponds. Additionally, despite their apparent isolation from other surface waters, it is also becoming evident that ponds and other small wetlands, including those which do not have direct surface connections with adjacent waterbodies, still influence downstream waters (US EPA, 2015; Cohen et al., 2016). Wetlands and open waters away from floodplains provide numerous functions that benefit downstream waterbody integrity, including storage of floodwater; recharge of groundwater, retention and transformation of nutrients, metals and pesticides and export of organisms or reproductive propagules to adjacent waters',\n",
       " 'They can be connected to downstream waters through surface water, shallow subsurface water and groundwater flows and through biological and chemical connections.',\n",
       " \"Although there is ample evidence of hydrologic, chemical and biological links between these 'upstream' and 'downstream' waterbodies, few studies specifically address the magnitude of these fluxes. Some effects of ponds and wetlands on downstream waters are due to their isolation, rather than their connectivity, particularly because of the wetland's ability to isolate material fluxes (US EPA, 2015). Finally, small-scale water supply is provided by ponds throughout the world but has attracted little scientific attention. In Eurasia, small-scale water storage using ponds has occurred for centuries and many ponds in Europe have been created for water supply reasons. In the Americas, as agricultural intensification continues, a large number of agricultural ponds have been created, probably having a substantial, but little investigated, impact on hydrology\",\n",
       " 'For example, small farm ponds are now the dominant lentic ecosystem in the Great Plains of the United States (Huggins et al., 2011) and are common in parts of Brazil (Bichsel et al. 2016).',\n",
       " 'Importance and ecosystem services of small streams A considerable number of papers have documented the importance of small streams and headwaters but few have done so from the perspective of ecosystem services. The ecosystem services, or direct and indirect benefits, humans derive from headwaters include water provision, recharge of ground waters, flood control, trapping of sediment and pollutants, nutrients recycling, maintenance of biological diversity and support of downstream water quality and productivity (Meyer & Wallace, 2001;Meyer et al., 2007a).',\n",
       " \"In terms of water provision, it is intuitively obvious that small streams collect and deliver a considerable volume of the water to higher order streams and rivers, lakes and reservoirs but there are few calculations of that contribution. According to Saunders et al. (2009), some 90% of a river's flow is derived from headwater streams. Alexander et al. (2007), in a study in the north-eastern United States, concluded that first-order headwaters contribute approximately 70% of the water volume and 65% of the nitrogen flux in second-order streams and that their contributions to mean water volume and nitrogen flux decline only marginally to about 55 and 40% in fourth-order and higher order rivers that include navigable waters and their tributaries\",\n",
       " 'Other studies also attribute a high proportion of surface water, nutrient and organic matter retention to headwater capture (Meyer & Wallace, 2001;MacDonald & Coe, 2007;Hill et al., 2014). However, the contribution depends on whether the outflow from headwaters is synchronised or desynchronised (Gomi et al., 2002).',\n",
       " \"The regulating and maintenance services and supporting processes are more poorly documented. Small streams, for example, have been popularly characterised as the 'capillaries' of the water system and are critically important for flow regulation both through water storage/groundwater recharge and through flood amelioration. As our climate changes in coming decades, the buffering function of the small water system will increase through a need for water conservation, and to ameliorate exceptional and damaging flood events. Small waters play a critical role in the transfer of nutrients and carbon to downstream reaches (Dodds & Oakes, 2008) and are increasingly seen as playing a role in urban and rural water pollutant interception (e.g. Kadlec 2012, Merilla & Tonjes, 2014)\",\n",
       " 'They also show greater response to precipitation events than larger systems, which shapes instream habitats and influences the supply of sediment from hillslopes and subsequent delivery to downstream reaches (Gomi et al., 2002). Fine sediment is a vital element in freshwater systems and important to nutrient cycling, substrate composition and heterogeneity, all of which influence instream habitats and thus aquatic community composition (Rabeni & Minshall, 1977;Wood & Armitage, 1997). Headwater streams provide both storage conditions for sediment, especially where there are debris dams, as well as influencing its distribution downstream (Gomi et al., 2002). Thus, small streams have a strong influence on downstream water quality. The central role of small streams in the maintenance of catchment biodiversity, both in terms of unique species and contribution to downstream communities, has already been highlighted in this paper',\n",
       " 'The maintenance of fish population by the spawning and nursery habitat in small streams is well documented in contrast to many of the other services in this category.',\n",
       " 'With respect to cultural services, small streams have an aesthetic value and contribute to a sense of place. They are likely to contribute to recreation where they are part of walking routes and can be enjoyed for the aquatic and riparian wildlife they support.',\n",
       " '## Ecosystem services provided by ditches and springs Comparatively little information is available concerning the contribution of ditches and spring to ecosystem services other than their specific drainage function. Clearly, it is axiomatic that ditches provide a very substantial land drainage and flood control function (Smedema et al., 2004), as well as contributing similar ecosystem services to those known for natural and constructed ponds and wetlands (see review by Dollinger et al., 2015). As in other small waters, the potential for ditches to provide ecosystem services varies substantially. For example, Dollinger et al. (2015) conclude that the reduction in nutrient loads along a ditch reach varies from 3 to 92% depending on the nutrient considered and the characteristics of ditches. They note that total nitrogen and phosphorus are preferentially reduced along ditches with regard to nitrates and ammonium. Similarly, reductions in pesticides vary widely from 5 to 95%.',\n",
       " 'Since ancient times, the most obvious ecosystem service provided by springs is drinking water supply. Other services include hot water either for heating purposes such as in Iceland or for bathing. This is then often coupled with high mineral content and is proposed to have therapeutic values. Already in Roman times, hot spring water was used for leisure activities and also Japanese macaques are famous for taking hot baths in spring water. Spring water is also irreplaceable for brewing and it is still important for livestock watering and crop irrigation (Glazier, 2014).',\n",
       " '## Impacts on small waterbodies ## Ponds and small lakes The extent of our knowledge of environmental of impacts on ponds and small lakes is markedly contrasting. For ponds, we understand the general extent of impacts, and some broad patterns, such as the significance of land-use intensification for water quality and biota (Declerck et al., 2006;Williams et al., 2010a;Novikmec et al., 2016;Bichsel et al., 2016). However, we lack detailed understanding of the relative importance of specific stressors and the mechanisms through which they operate in ponds. For small lakes, in contrast, including those in the 5-10 ha size range (Sayer et al., 2010), there are a wide range of studies investigating the importance of a range of stressors, and many detailed studies of the processes which those stressors influence',\n",
       " 'These have led to well-developed conceptual models of the effects of stressors on lakes (see Fig. 4).',\n",
       " 'Ponds are threatened by many human activities such as development and intensive agriculture, and by climate change. Several studies indicate that, at a landscape level, ponds can experience both more impacts and fewer impacts than nearby larger waters. For example, because ponds have small volumes, there may be less potential for dilution of pollutants. Conversely, because ponds have small catchments, their catchments are much more likely to fall entirely within areas of natural forest, heathland or unfertilised grassland which produce unpolluted water, and to be less exposed to point source pollutions (sewage effluent, road runoff). In contrast, larger waterbodies with larger catchments are more likely to be exposed to such pollutants. For example, Williams et al',\n",
       " '(2004) showed that in a stratified random sample of freshwater habitats typical of UK lowland farmed landscape, ponds had phosphate concentrations that ranged from 2 to 2490 lg/l -1 (mean 270 lg/l -1 ), whereas larger rivers in the same landscape showed a range from only 60 to 1300 lg/l -1 (mean 240 lg/l -1 ). Shade can also play an important role in influencing pond biodiversity, especially where once open, grazed landscapes have been converted to arable land or lost their grazing for some other reason. At least in the UK landscape, this local influence is clearly more important for small waters than larger lakes, although there are no comparative studies with which to evaluate the generality of this apparently ubiquitous pattern',\n",
       " 'However, although the extent of impacts on ponds in some regions is now reasonably well understood, impacts which have been extensively investigated in larger waters, such as the role of multiple stressors (Sayer et al., 2006;Phillips et al., 2016), the comparative importance of climate, nutrients, depth and waterbody size (Scheffer & van Nes, 2007) and the relative importance of biotic and physico-chemical stressors (e.g. fish, nutrients, grazers) (Gorman et al., 2014) Fig. 4 Process and pressures in the two alternative stable states seen in shallow lakes. Reproduced with permission from Phillips et al., (2016) have barely been examined in ponds.

In small lakes, a large body of theory and observation can give the impression that we clearly understand the main mechanisms and, in particular, the corrective steps needed to rehabilitate systems. However, as Phillips et al. (2016) have recently argued, despite 40 years of work, it is still uncertain what causes one of the major impacts seen on small and shallow lakes, the loss of macrophytes associated with eutrophication, and, critically, how to reverse that problem.\",\n",
       " 'Small and large lakes have experienced substantial impacts as a result of atmospheric deposition with the clearest impact resulting from increased acidity on poorly buffered geologies (Battarbee et al., 2014). The effects on ponds have been little studied and may be different to those seen in both small and larger lakes (Campbell et al., 2004). Atmospheric deposition on base-rich soils probably affects small waterbodies mainly by adding to the nitrogen load but detecting these effects has been difficult given that much higher loads are commonly supplied from surface water sources.',\n",
       " '## Impacts on small streams The high land contact and relatively low water volume of small streams make them particularly vulnerable to degradation from land-use and other anthropogenic activities (McGarrigle, 2014). Meyer & Wallace (2001) and later Meyer et al. (2007a) summarised the wide range of anthropogenic activities that impact small streams including drainage, deforestation, piping and culverting and discharges of a range of pollutants. Small streams flowing through urban area are at risk from the greatest range of pollutants and habitat alteration (e.g. Nelson et al., 2009). Nutrient enrichment is probably the most pervasive of impacts affecting hydrochemical conditions, organic matter processing and export, trophic responses and structure of aquatic communities (Benstead et al., 2009;Davies et al., 2009)',\n",

For example, Rosemond et al. (2015) have shown that both nitrogen and phosphorus added to streams accelerate carbon (leaf litter, woody debris) breakdown with potentially substantial and very wide ranging impacts on ecosystem structure and function. Both removal of natural forests (Meyer & Wallace, 2001) and planting of non-native commercial conifers in headwater catchments have resulted in a range of impacts. Commercial forest operations have the potential to cause impacts right through the forest cycle, from planting to felling (Kelly-Quinn et al., 2016). Diffuse nutrient and sediment pollution has been associated with preparation for both planting and felling (e.g',\n",

Dodds & Oakes (2008) and Lassaletta et al. (2010) emphasised the linkages between headwater and downstream chemistry and that land-use impacts in headwaters as described also have significant effects on downstream conditions. It is also increasingly clear that, for streams, the preservation of regional biodiversity requires both freedom from stressors (e.g. water pollution, intensive land use) and proximity to other high-quality streams to facilitate dispersal of sensitive taxa and suppress the proliferation of tolerant groups (Merriam & Petty, 2016).',\n",

Less is known of impacts outside of Europe, but is presumably substantial in all cultivated and drained landscapes. Now, in Switzerland for example, natural springs in the Jura Mountains are found almost exclusively in forested areas (Zollho ¨fer, 1997). The main reasons for the loss of springs are water abstraction for drinking water supply, construction of wells for cattle or drainage of farmland. Anthropogenic degradation of springs also happens via acidification or heavy metal pollution and mechanical stress such as cattle trampling. Like all other small waterbodies, in Europe springs are not included in the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) although in some countries there is protection under national laws',\n",

Management plans and efforts to systematically catalog the conservation status of springs have been made all over the world (e.g., Lischewski, 1999;Fatchen, 2000;Sada et al., 2001;Hotzy & Ro ¨mheld, 2008;Barquin & Scarsbrook, 2008).

However, because ditches often have quite small catchments, they also offer greater opportunities for protection from water pollution than larger waterbodies. This can be seen in the heterogeneity of water quality when compared to other freshwater habitats. For example, Biggs et al. (2014b) in a stratified random sample of waterbodies in the lowland English farmed landscape found that ditches surveyed in late winter/early spring generally had the greatest range of values in most of the common water quality determinants including nutrients, heavy metals and organic pollutants',\n",

Gaps in our understanding include quite fundamental aspects of function and structure: for example, the hydrology, geochemical processes, assemblages of organisms and the population ecology of the species that make up those assemblages all remain poorly studied. Other than for the large and obvious macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and amphibians, even basic inventories are lacking for algae and other microorganisms, microcrustaceans, non-vascular plants, Diptera (which make up about half of all larger invertebrates in small waterbodies) and the semiterrestrial invertebrate fauna in small waterbodies\",\n",
       " 'The role of small waters as refuges for freshwater biodiversity and techniques for protecting that biodiversity all remain relatively under-researched even though these waterbodies are some of the most tractable when it comes to tackling the main impacts of human activity on freshwaters. Perhaps, the most important need is for more studies comparing different types of waterbody, large and small. This approach has proved fruitful for understanding freshwater biodiversity in ponds, but has been adopted to a very limited extent in virtually all other studies of the structure and function of freshwaters (for a recent exception, see Schriever & Lytle, 2016). However, we anticipate that for many aspects of practical freshwater biodiversity conservation, and the understanding of ecosystem services, such comparative studies will be vital.',\n",

We are aware of only one long-term repeat survey of a group of ponds (Nicolet, 2000). Additionally, important knowledge often remains largely anecdotal: for example, one pond first surveyed in the 1970s (Palmer, 1973), and subsequently revisited over more than 40 years, provides the only currently available evidence of the potential for pond plant communities to remain exceptionally rich, and retain specific endangered species, over reasonable lengths of time (Palmer, 2010).',\n",

A major area of uncertainty remains the role of connectivity between different types of waterbodies, and the probably critical role of ponds as refuges in landscapes which are increasingly hostile to freshwater biodiversity. Understanding of the extent to which ponds function as networks, how they interact with other freshwaters, the frequency of movement between sites and factors controlling how species move between sites are poorly understood and restricted to a few better-studied groups, particularly amphibians and dragonflies (e.g. Pittman et al., 2014;Hassall & Thompson, 2012) and to specific river floodplain scenarios (Karaus et al. 2005(Karaus et al. , 2013))',\n",

Increasingly in human-modified landscapes, isolation is essential for the maintenance of populations through keeping waterbodies isolated from pollutant sources, maintaining barriers to non-native species, and providing ''water-friendly'' management regimes, especially those involving low-intensity grazing on high-nature-value farmland, which appear to simulate aeonsold natural disturbance regimes. Recent observations of ponds in England (Williams, unpublished data) indicates that losses of sensitive biota from highquality, relatively unimpaired, ponds first surveyed in the late 1980s and early 1990s have continued. We do not know whether this is due to an extinction debt (Kuussaari et al., 2009) or simply reflects short-term changes in habitat quality which could be ameliorated.\",\n",

One of the most important practical conservation issues to assess is the balance between protecting, and increasing the number of, currently high-quality ponds (Williams et al., 1997) versus the management of degraded or fish impacted sites (Lemmens et al., 2015), particularly those exposed to agricultural pollution. Should we dredge ponds or remove fish to benefit biodiversity (removing pollutants, reducing physical disturbance and resetting the successional stage) or focus first on the protection of water quality followed by the maintenance of low-intensity physical interventions, such as achieved by low-density grazing, to maintain a range of successional states? Given the well-demonstrated risks of damaging pond assemblages by invasive physical management first highlighted by Biggs et al',\n",
       " '(1994), a risk which is still apparent (Biggs, personal observations), this remains an important issue.',\n",
       " \"In addition to managing ponds, can we use ponds to re-build freshwater biodiversity across landscapes in which near-universal water pollution has made larger waterbodies (such as lakes or rivers) inhospitable to many species? The first evidence that ponds can protect landscape-scale biodiversity has been obtained in the UK Water Friendly Farming project (Biggs et al., 2014b) in which pond creation was shown to have stopped a landscape-wide decline in the diversity of aquatic plants. This approach could play a major role in protecting freshwater biodiversity given the inherent richness of ponds, their disproportionate numbers of endangered species and the evidence of success from practical programmes. It has been exploited practically in the UK's Million Ponds Project, detailed evaluations of which are just beginning but which show promising colonisation of new, high-quality clean water ponds by species of conservation concern\",\n",
       " 'As pond creation projects are not automatically successful, it is clear that further evaluation of their potential is needed (Calhoun et al., 2014).',\n",
       " '## Streams As noted by Alexander et al. (2007), the recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, related to Clean Water Act decisions by agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, highlight the need to improve scientific understanding of the contribution of headwaters to the physical, chemical and biological integrity of downstream waters. Research needs and priorities have also been highlighted by researchers such as Heino et al. (2003b), Lowe & Likens (2005) and Meyer et al. (2007a, b) and Barmuta et al. (2009).',\n",
       " 'The primary need is to further document the biological diversity of headwaters and the spatial population dynamics of species within stream networks, including the relative importance of environmental factors and links to other aquatic and terrestrial habitats. The diversity of some groups such as the Diptera is poorly described and is likely to further elevate the biodiversity importance of small streams. The aquatic communities of short coastal streams are also largely unknown; in western Europe, their contribution to migratory fish production (sea trout) and coastal fisheries is important, and similar patterns probably occur elsewhere. Given the heterogeneity of small stream habitats, studies will have to be extensive in their site coverage.\\nGiven the threats to freshwater biodiversity generally, there is a need to better understand the environmental conditions which support the high regional biodiversity of some biological groups-e.g. macroinvertebrates. Studies have typically developed through an upstream/downstream paradigm, but interactions across landscapes may be as important.',\n",
       " 'All running waters originate in their headwaters so there is a need to quantify how cumulative inputs to and impacts on headwaters affect downstream resources. In particular, there is a need to further quantify the effects of nutrient processing (autotrophic and heterotrophic uptake,), cycling and export of nutrients in headwaters on nutrient status further downstream. Equally, we need to establish how hydrological and habitat alteration of headwaters affects ecological processes in the larger catchment.\\nGiven the importance of small streams and at the same time their high vulnerability to land use and other inputs, there is a need for research on both the resistance and the resilience of small stream processes to anthropogenic disturbance.',\n",
       " 'The aforementioned investigations need to incorporate and model the impact of climate on hydrological and physico-chemical conditions and ecological processes in small streams. As noted for ponds, longterm studies are needed to characterise natural temporal changes in physico-chemical and ecological conditions, and responses to management. If these knowledge gaps are addressed, it will provide a better understanding of the ecosystem services derived from small streams and what is required to maintain services supply. Therefore, in addition to fundamental research on ecosystems structure and function, there is a need for operationally focussed investigations including the development of specific guidance on management and restoration of small streams. This may be particularly critical for temporary streams. For example, Larned et al. (2010) called for conservation and management options that address their unique properties',\n",
       " \"They noted that effective management requires 'preservation or restoration of aquatic-terrestrial habitat mosaics, preservation or restoration of natural flow intermittence, and identification of flow requirements for highly valued species and processes'.\",\n",
       " \"Finally, monitoring of water quality in the very extensive small stream network will remain a challenge for regulatory authorities. Thus, there is an opportunity to engage citizen science but this will require selection of determinants and development of kits or tools, both physico-chemical and ecological, that would generate useful and reliable data. Some initiatives are already in place, for example the Angler's Riverfly Monitoring Initiative run by the UK Riverfly Partnership (http://www.riverflies.org/rp- riverfly-monitoring-initiative).\",\n",
       " '## Springs Until recently, it was commonly thought that crenobiont species are primarily adapted to constant environmental conditions. Now, we know that especially water temperature is often much less constant than assumed. Why then are crenobiont species bound to springs? Approximating the answer will help understand, e.g., how sensitive crenobiont species really are towards climatic changes. In this context, autecological studies are needed including, e.g., experimental approaches on how crenobiont species react to changes in their environment but also broader approaches at higher levels of organisation such as food web analysis (see e.g. Robinson et al., 2008;Woodward et al., 2010). Concepts for long-term monitoring of springs in different biogeographical regions are also needed to understand future developments of species diversity and ecosystem functioning in springs.',\n",
       " 'The most striking question, which will also provide important information for conservation strategies, is how isolated populations of species exclusively inhabiting springs really are. Isolation would make conservation of each spring in a certain region necessary, while connected populations, i.e. metapopulations, may justify the further use of some springs, e.g. for drinking water supply or the abandonment of some natural springs in a region with a similar or even identical genetic pool. This indicates that research should focus on genetic analyses at population and species level and on metapopulation modelling (see Von Fumetti and Blattner, 2016).',\n",
       " 'Knowing the degree of genetic exchange and population connectivity is an important step for the conservation of springs to be brought in line with the sustainable use of spring water, which is an urgent future challenge. For spring conservation and restoration, an international concept is needed in concordance with the river types of the WFD. Such a concept should define international standards and, on a regional scale, regional spring types, their eco-morphological features and species assemblages (see e.g. Zollho ¨fer et al., 2000;Von Fumetti & Nagel, 2011;Martin & Brunke, 2012). This is crucial for assessing the ecological status of springs in relation to a reference status and to evaluate their restoration potential. In this regard, it will also be desirable to develop consistent evaluation sheets, which also consider regional aspects as they are implemented in the WFD',\n",

       " '## Ditches As the least investigated part of the freshwater environment, ditches have remained largely outside the realm of traditional freshwater ecology. Despite this, ditches have been of considerable practical significance in two areas: pesticide risk assessment where they have become a model system (e.g. Renaud & Brown, 2008;Renaud et al., 2008) and, in some countries, where they have been the focus of a very large body of practical conservation activity and survey work (see Drake et al., 2010 for an example from the United Kingdom). These projects are mostly in places where ditches represent the remaining vestiges of freshwater habitats in otherwise drained wetlands.',\n",
       " \"Little is known about the ecology of ditches. Most studies have been carried out on the classic permanently wet ditches typical of drained wetlands. However, most ditches are found outside this landscape type (Brown et al., 2006) and it is clear that ditches can be broadly divided into stream-like and standing water-like habitats. In one southern England landscape, stream-like 'upland' ditches showed greater heterogeneity than rivers or streams themselves (Fig. 5).\\nKey research areas for ditch systems are, therefore, as follows:\",\n",
       " \"• Understanding similarities to, and differences from, other freshwater habitats. • Understanding the extent to which they provide refuges for endangered species. • In some locations, the threat faced from sea-level change. At least in Europe, ditch networks are both important freshwater biodiversity reserves and, in coastal regions where many occur, vulnerable to the complete elimination of this special freshwater biota by saline water intrusion. • A critical practical question for ditch networks is the extent to which they can be linked to inland habitats and their rich and vulnerable biota successfully 'moved inland' to avoid coastal squeeze (Clarke, 2015). This is likely to prove a very challenging problem as little is known about the interaction between ditch connectivity, hydrology, water quality, metapopulation dynamics and the achievement of successful conservation outcomes in ditch networks.\",\n",
       " '## Recommendations for policy makers and legislators Small waters, still and flowing, are an intrinsic and highly significant component of the freshwater environment, of equal importance to the larger waters that are the focus of most current legislation and practical action. There needs to be better integration of international, national and regional networks and organisations to ensure that current and new policies, legislation and funding opportunities support the conservation and effective management of small waters (Biggs et al., 2014a). The primary recommendation for policy makers and legislators is to recognise the importance of small waterbodies for freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem function as well as the maintenance of ecosystem services. It is clear that in all landscapes, a starting point in the management of the water environment should include an evaluation of the role of both small and large waters, including those which are manmade.',\n",
       " \"Because of their size, small waterbodies are easier to protect than larger waters and there is evidence that it may be easier to maintain them in a near-natural condition (in the terminology of the WFD, at 'High' status). There is also good evidence that ponds and small lakes can be created in a way which mimics natural processes and can be used to help restore freshwater biodiversity at landscape level, increasing Polygon size provides a measure of macroinvertebrate assemblage heterogeneity showing that rivers have the least, and ponds and ditches the most, heterogeneous assemblages. Triangle = ditches, filled square = ponds, filled circle = streams, circle = rivers. From Williams et al. (2004) connectivity, resilience and biodiversity\",\n",
       " \"In terms of restoration of existing freshwaters, current evidence indicates that the vast majority of stream restoration projects rarely demonstrate a biodiversity recovery post-hydrogeomorphic adjustment (Palmer et al., 2014;Law et al., 2016), and increasingly emphasise the critical need to improve water quality (e.g. Turunen et al., 2016), which may be more achievable in small rather than larger waters. This is in part because small waters are more likely to have catchments dominated by predominantly 'water-friendly' land uses which are less likely to act as pollutant sources, such as natural forest, extensive grasslands, high-nature-value farmland or other natural or seminatural vegetation types. However, restoration of water quality in small streams in high-intensity agricultural catchments is more challenging\",\n",

The hydrological input of organic matter and nutrients across the terrestrial-aquatic boundary is also high relative to surface area in lakes of similar character when the drainage ratio (catchment area/lake area) is high.

Even though small aquatic ecosystems create favourable conditions for a number of organisms of various ecological requirements, they have never received much attention from researchers compared with larger reservoirs (Oertli et al., 2002). This especially applies to a specific and very unique kind of pond -meteorite craters, which were the object of this research. The origin of ponds is very diverse and they can be created by a wide range of natural processes such as glaciation, volcanic activity, land subsidence, wind or river action, and tree falls, as well as by human activities such as mineral extraction or water storage (Oertli et al., 2005). Meteorite crater water bodies, however, belong to a very rare kind of aquatic ecosystem\n",

But equally, for many freshwater organisms, isolation between habitats is also important. Increasingly in human-modified landscapes, isolation is essential for the maintenance of populations through keeping waterbodies isolated from pollutant sources, maintaining barriers to non-native species, and providing ''water-friendly'' management regimes, especially those involving low-intensity grazing on high-nature-value farmland, which appear to simulate aeonsold natural disturbance regimes. Recent observations of ponds in England (Williams, unpublished data) indicates that losses of sensitive biota from highquality, relatively unimpaired, ponds first surveyed in the late 1980s and early 1990s have continued. We do not know whether this is due to an extinction debt (Kuussaari et al., 2009) or simply reflects short-term changes in habitat quality which could be ameliorated.\n",

Several studies indicate that, at a landscape level, ponds can experience both more impacts and fewer impacts than nearby larger waters.

Conversely, because ponds have small catchments, their catchments are much more likely to fall entirely within areas of natural forest, heathland or unfertilised grassland which produce unpolluted water, and to be less exposed to point source pollutions (sewage effluent, road runoff). In contrast, larger waterbodies with larger catchments are more likely to be exposed to such pollutants. For example, Williams et al\n",

The most recent estimates for macro-tidal northwest European marshes (Mo ¨ller et al., 1999(Mo ¨ller et al., , 2002) ) suggest rates of wave height reduction of up to 50% over the first 10e20 m of vegetated saltmarsh surface\n",

Oxygen consumption was Net Heterotrophy in Small Lakes determined as the rate of decline of dissolved O 2 in the enclosed water volume overlying the sediment. Water was stirred by a magnetic stirrer bar during incubation. Benthic respiration was corrected for respiration in the water overlying the sediment cores by parallel incubation of water alone. Benthic respiration measurements were assumed to be representative for the entire lake and the full year. This is obviously a crude assumption which does not account for spatial and temporal variability in the amount of labile organic matter\n",

      "Content: ## Conclusion The method of side-on photographs of stands of vegetation as developed in prototype by Mo ¨ller (2000) and, independently, by Zehm et al. (2003) for grasslands, has successfully been applied to marsh edge vegetation stands dominated by Spartina and Salicornia. A positive relationship was found to exist between %image obscuration and dry biomass of the photographed stands, although the nature of this relationship varied with vegetation type and canopy height. The technique provides a time-efficient method for estimating vegetation aboveground biomass and structure e a factor that is important when working in often harsh physical conditions. Furthermore, the technique allows a range of structural vegetation canopy parameters to be objectively quantified. Although this study focuses on vegetation canopy height and its variability only, other parameters such as the vertical and horizontal variation in vegetation density and the presence and size of gaps within the canopy can be quantified\n",

      "Content: Methane concentrations are also affected by lake area and depth: small and shallow lakes have more water in contact with anoxic sediments, less opportunity for methane oxidation between the sediments and surface water, and a well-mixed water column that permits benthic CH 4 to reach the surface (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Increased temperature also correlates with greater CH 4 concentrations as methanogenesis increases with temperature (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Interestingly, precipitation led to lower DOC in these ponds, implying an internal source of DOC (e.g. through leaf litter breakdown) that builds up between precipitation events and overmatches any DOC inputs from runoff. Overall, precipitation events dilute the biological and chemical parameters in small ponds, ultimately lowering CH 4 concentrations\n",

In terms of carbon cycling, understanding of the role of ponds and small lakes is growing rapidly at present, reflecting the awareness of the intensity of geochemical process in small waters and their abundance which appears to give them a role disproportionate to their physical extent. Thus, Downing et al. (2008) proposed that, globally, ponds trapped as much carbon as the ocean, a striking suggestion which has prompted substantial interest in the role of small waters in the carbon cycle. However, there is increasing evidence that certain conditions in small standing waters can lead to elevated methane emissions and the need to develop greater understanding of this disadvantage of small waters in regulating carbon should be noted. For example, ponds in the Arctic permafrost can contribute three quarters of landscape-level carbon dioxide emissions (Abnizova et al., 2012)\n",

       "\"Although there is ample evidence of hydrologic, chemical and biological links between these 'upstream' and 'downstream' waterbodies, few studies specifically address the magnitude of these fluxes. Some effects of ponds and wetlands on downstream waters are due to their isolation, rather than their connectivity, particularly because of the wetland's ability to isolate material fluxes (US EPA, 2015). Finally, small-scale water supply is provided by ponds throughout the world but has attracted little scientific attention. In Eurasia, small-scale water storage using ponds has occurred for centuries and many ponds in Europe have been created for water supply reasons. In the Americas, as agricultural intensification continues, a large number of agricultural ponds have been created, probably having a substantial, but little investigated, impact on hydrology\""
