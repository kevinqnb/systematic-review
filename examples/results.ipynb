      "Growing urbanization and climate variability have placed immense pressure on the finite supply of groundwater available for agricultural irrigation. As a result, the exploration of alternative irrigation water sources, including recycled water and pond water, has become a global priority (Scheierling et al., 2006;Parsons et al., 2010;Ortega-Reig et al., 2014). While there is no universal standard, ponds are generally defined as small (1 m 2 to ∼50,000 m 2 ), shallow, standing water bodies that can either permanently or temporarily collect freshwater (Biggs et al., 2005;De Meester et al., 2005;Céréghino et al., 2008). These small water bodies are known to house a rich tapestry of aquatic plant and macroinvertebrate species, even greater than that of other larger water bodies (e.g., lakes and rivers) (Biggs et al., 2005). Moreover, the high terrestrial and aquatic interchange of ponds may enable both small free-living (<1 µm) and large/particleassociated bacteria to proliferate (Søndergaard et al., 2005;Roiha et al., 2016). Therefore, assessing the microbial diversity and interactions of these complex water bodies is a critical first step with regard to completing a comprehensive characterization of pond biodiversity, and evaluating the suitability of pond freshwater for agricultural applications, such as the irrigation of food crops.\n",

      "'Small waterbodies' is an ambiguous term with, as yet, no universally accepted or legal definition. In this paper, we use the term to refer to ponds and small lakes, small streams including headwaters, ditches and springs. In the following section, the approaches which have been taken to derive these definitions are described.## Ponds and small lakes\n",
      "Ponds are small standing waters varying in size from 1 m 2 to about 2-5 ha in area and may be permanent or seasonal, man-made or naturally created (Pond Conservation Group, 1993;Collinson et al., 1995;Biggs et al., 2007;E.P.C.N., 2007;Cereghino et al., 2008). Although there is a long history, dating back to the nineteenth century, of attempts to define the difference between a pond and a lake (Biggs et al., 2005), large ponds and small lakes share many characteristics in terms of structure and function, and the transition zone between the two types of habitat is very gradual (Søndergaard et al., 2005;De Meester et al., 2005). Indeed, ponds merge imperceptibly into virtually all other freshwater habitat types (Biggs et al., 1997). However, for practical purposes, such as estimating waterbody numbers or comparing waterbody types, most authors have adopted a size-based classification with a size boundary somewhere between 1 and 5 ha, which can be fairly easily measured in the field (e.g. Williams et al., 2004;Kalettka & Rudat, 2006;Davies et al., 2008a, b;De Bie et al., 2008;Williams et al., 2010a). Occasionally, 'pond' studies are restricted to waters of no more than 0.5 ha (e.g. Lafitte et al., 2009) or extended to include those up to 8 m in depth or 10 ha in area (e.g. Oertli et al., 2000Oertli et al., , 2005)).

      "## Introduction\n",
      "Despite the growth of interest in, and understanding of, small waters, much 'basic' science remains to be done. Gaps in our understanding include quite fundamental aspects of function and structure: for example, the hydrology, geochemical processes, assemblages of organisms and the population ecology of the species that make up those assemblages all remain poorly studied. Other than for the large and obvious macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and amphibians, even basic inventories are lacking for algae and other microorganisms, microcrustaceans, non-vascular plants, Diptera (which make up about half of all larger invertebrates in small waterbodies) and the semiterrestrial invertebrate fauna in small waterbodies. The role of small waters as refuges for freshwater biodiversity and techniques for protecting that biodiversity all remain relatively under-researched even though these waterbodies are some of the most tractable when it comes to tackling the main impacts of human activity on freshwaters. Perhaps, the most important need is for more studies comparing different types of waterbody, large and small. This approach has proved fruitful for understanding freshwater biodiversity in ponds, but has been adopted to a very limited extent in virtually all other studies of the structure and function of freshwaters (for a recent exception, see Schriever & Lytle, 2016). However, we anticipate that for many aspects of practical freshwater biodiversity conservation, and the understanding of ecosystem services, such comparative studies will be vital.Despite the work of pioneers of freshwater ecology, like Charles Elton, who produced the first categorisation of freshwater habitats (for Elton, ponds were waterbodies less than 1 acre (Elton & Miller, 1954)), TT 'Kit' Macan (Macan, 1973) and Jack Talling (Talling, 1951), the study of ponds became a backwater in the second half of the twentieth century, really only gaining momentum in the twentyfirst century, in Europe particularly as a result of the work of the European Pond Conservation Network (Oertli et al., 2009) and in North America by ecologists interested in wetlands (e.g. Batzer et al., 1999;Batzer & Boix, 2016).\n",

      "Small waterbodies include natural, artificial and heavily modified waterbodies. They are important in their own right, and also important for their influence on larger waters. They are the commonplace freshwater habitats in virtually all landscapes but have been overlooked by freshwater science until recently. They are often both the most and least degraded remaining examples of freshwater habitats because their small catchments make them both more vulnerable to stresses, and more likely to escape those stresses. Despite this, they still largely lie outside the mainstream of freshwater science and policy making although practitioners, landowners and ordinary people are as likely to interact with them as a great lake or large river.The protection and management of small waterbodies presents a substantial, and achievable, opportunity to protect an important component of the freshwater environment. We encourage policy makers and legislators to help facilitate this goal.### Fig\n",

      "Ponds are small lentic ecosystems that permanently or temporarily hold water [1]. They are shallow and their size ranges from a few square metres to several hectares. They can be natural or man-made. Their number is much higher than that of large lakes, which constitute a small percentage of the total number of lakes [2]. Despite this, studies of lentic ecosystems have concentrated mainly on moderately large lakes [2].Ponds differ functionally from larger lakes [3], since their littoral structure and its productivity dominates the ecosystem [2]. Despite their small size they contain a significant part of aquatic biodiversity on the landscape scale [4,5]. Humans have created millions of ponds for multiple purposes [2], but today they serve as refugia for a variety of freshwater biota [5] and are, as such, an irreplaceable type of habitat [6][7][8].The biotic communities that develop in ponds depend on environmental conditions and human activity. Several studies document clear associations between the communities and a variety of environmental gradients, such as hydro-period [9,10], surface area [11], and water properties like water transparency, nutrient availability, and pH [12][13][14]. Compared to rivers and lakes, ponds exhibit greater environmental and, consequently, biotic amplitudes [15].\n",

      "ponds1 text: ## INTRODUCTION\n",
      "The functioning of small water bodies may differ in a variety of aspects from that of lakes (Biggs et al., 2005;Likens, 2009). Even though small aquatic ecosystems create favourable conditions for a number of organisms of various ecological requirements, they have never received much attention from researchers compared with larger reservoirs (Oertli et al., 2002). This especially applies to a specific and very unique kind of pond -meteorite craters, which were the object of this research. The origin of ponds is very diverse and they can be created by a wide range of natural processes such as glaciation, volcanic activity, land subsidence, wind or river action, and tree falls, as well as by human activities such as mineral extraction or water storage (Oertli et al., 2005). Meteorite crater water bodies, however, belong to a very rare kind of aquatic ecosystem. This is why our knowledge of their functioning, including seasonal changes in the structure and dynamics of their inhabiting organisms, is still rudimentary. Therefore, a study on the relationships between zooplankton occurrence and the physical-chemical features of such unique ecosystems is extremely necessary, especially as human impact and adverse climatic conditions may contribute to their rapid disappearance. One of the main problems connected with the functioning of small aquatic ecosystems may lie in an increase in trophic conditions which are equated with the amount of nutrients dissolved in water and deposited in sediments. The quality of waters will reflect the character of the catchment area and also the level of anthropogenic transformation in the surrounding area (Dodson et al., 2007), particularly when a pond is situated in the vicinity of urban areas. This is why the main focus of this study, conducted on the meteorite crater ponds which are located in the neighbourhood of the city of Pozna ń, was directed at estimating the impact of abiotic features of the aquatic environment on the structure of both rotifer and crustacean communities in seasonal terms, including spring, summer and autumn. Furthermore, small water bodies create vital hotspots and refugia for aquatic biodiversity in a variety of landscape types. This is particularly important on the local scale as they are aquatic habitats of a great abundance of distribution, being usually much more common than larger lakes (Søndergaard et al., 2005). Their role in agricultural, forested and urban regions is vital. As the morphometric features of ponds will make them prone to changes occurring in the surrounding environment, they are among the most threatened habitats (Oertli et al., 2005). Moreover, the vast majority of small water bodies undergo the process of terrestrialisation, which may result in negative implications for biodiversity. Not only will the concentration of nutrients structure the assemblages of plankton in small water bodies, but physical factors will also play a role (Karabin et al., 1997;Wilk-Wo źniak et al., 2011;Czerniawski and Domagała, 2012). However, in ecosystems with varying environmental conditions, organisms have to adapt in order to survive and develop. Therefore, particular\n",

Furthermore, biotic relationships between particular groups of organisms, including predation pressure and/or competition, is often of great importance when discussing distribution of zooplankton inhabiting small aquatic systems (Wickham and Gilbert, 1990;W ęgle ńska et al., 1997). A lack of fish in an aquatic environment may contribute to changes in the food webs, and in particular, the simplification of animal plankton structure because large representatives of crustaceans may over-dominate, thus winning the competition with smaller zooplankters.\n",

      "The Morasko meteorite nature reserve is situated in Morasko (N: 52 • 28 57.11, E: 16 • 53 27.82), in the northern part of the city of Pozna ń, in western Poland. The area within the reserve is made up of a unique combination of both the meteorites and the morphological effects of their fall (Stankowski, 2001). These craters are among the largest groups of craters on Earth, both in relation to their size and number. They form a group of seven meteorite craters, located on the slope of \"Góra Moraska\", which creates a culmination of an end-moraine ridge. They are round in shape and shallow, with the maximum depth of the largest water body not exceeding 1 m (Table I). All ponds were transparent to the bottom during the whole investigation period. The Morasko meteorite nature reserve was created in 1976 and it covers an area of 55 hectares. All the ponds are situated within the forest area (Figure 1). These meteorite craters are supplied only by rainwater. Therefore, due to the temporal character of most of them, only some ponds still exist, while others have already dried out completely. Two ponds (Nos. I and II), that underwent the investigation, carried water throughout the whole period of examination; however, in the autumn season a considerable loss of water depth was observed. At the same time, two other craters (Nos. III and IV) had no water in the autumn. As a result of oxygen deficiencies and low pH no fish occur in these water bodies.\n",

On analysing the distribution of zooplankton species richness between particular ponds it was found that crater pond No. III was characterised by the lowest mean number of rotifer species and highest of crustaceans, while in pond No. IV the opposite pattern, with the greatest variation in rotifer species and lowest in crustaceans, was observed (Table II). It was found that bdelloids, Lecane elsa, Cephalodella gibba (Ehrenberg), Lepadella patella (O.F.

Rotifer densities, unlike the species composition, reached significantly higher (KW-H 2,30 = 3.19, p < 0.01) densities on average compared with crustaceans (Table II). After analysing temporal distribution, only crustaceans revealed significant differences (KW-H 2,30 = 22.15, p < 0.01), with the highest abundance during the summer season. In the case of rotifers there was a trend of increasing density, starting from the spring and reaching a maximum in the autumn (Table II); however, this was not significant (p > 0.05). Rotifers reached on average 5107 ind L -1 in the autumn season, which was a result of a mass occurrence of Rotaria sp. (Tables II and III). Only densities of rotifers differed between particular ponds (KW-H 3,30 = 18.51, p < 0.01), with the highest values obtained for pond No. I due to the mass domination of Anuraeopsis fissa (Gosse) and Rotaria sp.

      "In addition to data from Black et al. (1963;  In winter, an inshore and an offshore station were selected in each lake. At each station, a hole was carefully drilled through the ice so as not to disturb the water below (the last bit of ice was gently tapped out Nvith an ice chisel). Water samples were collected 1-3 cm below the ice-water interface with a siphon sampler (Magnuson and Stuntz 1970), and with a Kemmerer bottle centered at 1 m below the interface, if depth permitted. For oxygen analyses, duplicate samples from each depth at each station were fixed immediately in the field and titrated (Winkler method, azide modification, American Public Health Association 1976) in the laboratory later the same day. Conductivity measurements were also made on the same day in the laboratory, using a Hach conductivity meter, Model #2510, (Hach Chemical Company, Loveland, Colorado) on samples taken at each of the two stations, warmed to 20'C. Total dissolved solids were measured on 100-mL water samples, filtered through 0.45-jim filters and evaporated at 1030. In summer, habitat structure was measured for three variables: depth, substrate type, and macrophytes. Measurements were made along the same transects used for the minnow traps, with 15-25 stations in small and/or structurally simple lakes, and 25-35 stations in larger, more complex lakes. At each station, water depth was measured to the nearest 1 cm, later grouped into five categories (Table 2). A substrate sample was\n",

      "We used multivariate techniques of classification and ordination to detect assemblage patterns in the fish data. In the matrices, the lakes were rows (entities) and the species were columns (attributes). Classifications were from the CLUSTAN IC package (Wishart 1975). Association analysis (Williams and Lambert 1959), with sum of chi-square as the maximum attribute sum on which cluster division was based, was used. Ordinations were Bray-Curtis types (Bray andCurtis 1957, Post et al. 1973). 1.0-S, (Czekanowski's coefficient) was employed as the distance measure; regression was used for endpoint selection (Post et al. 1973). Hypotheses generated by the classification-ordination analyses were examined using discriminant analysis programs (Schlater andLearn 1974, Dixon andBrown 1979).Czekanowski's similarity coefficients, Se, between winter and summer fish assemblages were calculated for each lake. These were used as measurements of the seasonal stability of the species compositions. To standardize sampling effort for these summer-winter comparisons, data from gear not used in both seasons were excluded: summer fyke net catches in four lakes (see Fish sampling, above) and all summer trammel net catches.Habitat diversities were calculated for each lake with the Shannon-Wiener formula, H' = -1pi In (pi) (Shannon and Weaver 1948), where pi is the proportion of all stations in the ith habitat category (from Table 2). Diversities were calculated for the three habitat factors (depth, substrate, vegetation) separately, all two-factor combinations of the three factors, and for the three factors combined, using the components of diversity method (Pielou 1977).\n",

      "lakes3 text: We derived a connectedness parameter for the lake \"islands.\" For seepage lakes, these values were equal to the lakes' watershed areas (Table 1). For drainage lakes, the values also included the watershed areas of the next adjacent lake both upstream and downstream, obtained from Black et al. (1963). For Maple and Spruce, seepage lakes with intermittent outlets, we added only one-half of the downstream watershed area. We believe that these connectedness values, while admittedly somewhat arbitrary, are meaningful ecologically because fishes in drainage lakes have the connecting lakes and streams as both potential refuges during severe conditions, and as source areas for potential immigrants.To examine the relationships between fish species richness and the lake environments, single and stepwise multiple linear regressions were performed on richness vs. the morphometric, limnological, and habitat diversity factors across all lakes, for each season.Multiple regressions were performed on 15 available  (1963; Table 1), and all factors measured in this study (Table 3), except mean depth. Because some factors (pH and the habitat diversity measures) were in a logarithmic form, and because many different units of measurements were used, a log10 transformation was used on all other environmental data. A log-log model was also used on the richness vs. lake area regressions, since this is the most standard way of presenting species-area relationships (Connor and McCoy 1979).A P = .05 level was used as the entering and leaving criterion for all multiple regressions.In addition to the standard stepwise procedure, in which the independent variable that is most highly correlated with the dependent variable is always first to enter the model, the multiple regressions were also run by starting with each independent variable as a base variable (Allen and Learn 1973). For this, the regression began with the base variable already included in the model, regardless of its correlation with the dependent variable. In this way, a combination of independent variables more successful (in terms of the probability level of the model's F ratio) than that chosen by the standard route could be identified. Correlations were also calculated among the environmental factors (Appendix I).\n",

      "We caught a total of 23 species, 18 in winter and 22 in summer (Appendix II).Summer.-In the ordination of summer fish assemblages (Fig. 2a), the first two axes accounted for 79% of the variation. An association analysis, which divided the assemblages hierarchically into progressively more similar groups, based on the presence and absence of key species, corresponded closely to the results of the ordination. The classification results at the four-group level are demarcated in Fig. 2a, and the \"key\" and abundant species of each group are listed in Table 4.The first division of the association analysis was based on the presence of the central mudminnow.   1). For drainage lakes, the values also included the watershed areas of the next adjacent lake both upstream and downstream.t Mean depth was determined by averaging the depths measured at 15-35 sampling stations in each lake (see text).

Maple and Spruce have intermittent outlets. One-half of the adjacent downstream watershed was added to their watershed area from Table 1.assemblages with the bullhead, Table 4). The third division (Fig. 2a) split the assemblages with mudminnows into Group III (one assemblage with northern pike) and Group IV (six lakes without pike, Table 4).All four Group I assemblages (Table 4) contained largemouth bass, three contained yellow perch, and three the bluegill. Three Group I lakes are dystrophic, small, seepage, and relatively deep, with much of their shorelines formed from sphagnum mat. They contained 2-4 species. The fourth lake (Maple) also has a considerable proportion of sphagnum shoreline, but is larger, somewhat shallower and connected to a relatively large watershed via an intermittent outlet. With 7 species, Maple's summer assemblage was richer than the other three Group I lakes.\n",

      "lakes3 text: The seven Group II assemblages (Table 4), without mudminnow but with black bullhead, had summer richnesses ranging from 5-10 species. Other abundant species were northern pike, white sucker, yellow perch, and pumpkinseed sunfish. All seven lakes are drainage or spring-fed lakes with relatively high levels of conductivity, pH, and other edaphic-productivity related characteristics of mesotrophic to eutrophic lakes.The Group IV assemblages had richnesses of 1-1 1 species. All six contained mudminnow, four had yellow perch, and four contained at least two minnow species (Cyprinidae; Table 4). In contrast with the oth-er groups, these assemblages contained neither large piscivores (pike, bass) nor sunfishes (Centrarchidae). Group IV lakes included four seepage lakes and two drainage lakes with small watersheds. All were shallow, with low to moderate winter dissolved oxygen levels (Tables 1, 3).The single Group III assemblage with both mudminnow and pike had a relatively rich summer assemblage of eight species (Table 4). It shared compositional similarities both with the other lakes with mudminnows (Group IV, e.g., two cyprinids) and the lakes without mudminnows (especially Group II, e.g., pike, black bullhead, pumpkinseed).Winter.-The results of the classification and the ordination of the winter assemblages showed little agreement. We felt that the ordination resulted in better patterns (Fig. 2b). Still, within-group compositional similarity was not high; only 51% of the variation was accounted for by the first two axes. From the ordination, four assemblage groups were subjectively distinguished (Fig. 2b). Their characteristic species are summarized in Table 4.The four winter groups did not correspond well to the four summer groups. Taken alone, the pattern of winter assemblages yielded few insights. However, as with the species richness patterns (see below), they did show that the relatively clear assemblage relationships of the summer broke down during winter.\n",

      "Summer.-The relationships between species richness and some environmental factors were similar in summer for the Umbra-cyprinid and centrarchid-Esox assemblages (Table 5). For example, vegetation diversity appeared as the most important single component of habitat structure in both assemblage types. Lake area was also significantly related to richness for both assemblage types.Other environmental factors were significantly related to richness in one assemblage type but not the other. Lake connectedness was significantly related to summer richness in centrarchid-Esox assemblages but not for the Umbra-cyprinid type (Table 5). Similarly, pH, conductivity, and alkalinity were also significantly related to richness in the centrarchid-Esox lakes, but not for Umbra-cyprinid assemblages (Table 5). The three-component habitat complexity factor and winter oxygen were significantly related to richness for the Umbra-cyprinid assemblage type, but they were not for centrarchid-Esox assemblages (Table 5). However, except for depth and depth-substrate diversity, the correlation coefficients between species richness and each environmental factor had the same sign in both assemblage types during summer. ences between the two assemblage types. For Umbracyprinid assemblages lake area and winter oxygen levels accounted for the most variation (Table 5).Species richness increased with lake area and decreased with increasing winter oxygen levels. For centrarchid-Esox assemblages lake connectedness and depth diversity explained the most variation (Table 5).Species richness increased with lake connectedness and with depth diversity.\n",

      "The predation hypothesis appears to offer the simplest explanation as to why the Umbra-cyprinid species were rarely found in the centrarchid-Esox lakes. Thus, we feel that combinations of physical and biological disturbances and refuges from these disturbance agents are the major factors responsible for the ecological maintenance of these two assemblage types. Specifically, disturbances come in the forms of low oxygen levels during winter, and predation. Refuges are provided by connections to well oxygenated streams or by the absence of predators due to low winter oxygen conditions. In lakes with predators, heavy densities of macrophytes may provide limited refuges from predation, allowing small populations of some Umbra-cyprinid species to persist. Because of these combinations of disturbances and refuges, we agree with Woodin (1978) that communities can be viewed as \"compilations of species successfully exploiting refuges in space and/or time.\"Species richness in the twvo assemblage types\n",
      "Productivity and habitat complexity.-Summer species richness in both assemblage types was highly correlated with measurements related to habitat complexity, particularly vegetation diversity (Table 5).Summer richness in centrarchid-Esox assemblages, but not in the Umbra-cyprinid lakes, was significantly related to factors related to productivity (pH, alkalinity, conductivity, total dissolved solids; Table 5).Habitat complexity has often been implicated as an important determinant of species richness in aquatic habitats. Werner et al. (1978), in a comparison of centrarchid lakes with similar structures from two different regions (Michigan and Florida), suggested the assemblages were \"saturated,\" and that habitat structure and morphometry strongly influenced the numbers of fish species that could coexist. Keast (1978) came to similar conclusions about many of the smaller, glacierformed lakes in North America. Niche segregation and complementarity have been observed in centrarchiddominated assemblages (Werner et al. 1977, 1978, Keast et al. 1978). Since most species' niches proved distinct with regard to one or more habitat factors, the number of coexisting fish species should increase with increased habitat complexity and heterogeneity.\n",

      "lakes3 text: This would particularly be likely if the most susceptible species to winterkill are the dominant predators or competitors of the assemblage (W. M. Tonn, personal observation). Beckman (1948) and Bennett (1948) found that growth increased in fish surviving population reductions caused by a severe winterkill and attributed this to increased food per fish. Apparently, competition for food had been reduced.In winter, richness in centrarchid-Esox assemblages was higher in lakes with higher winter oxygen levels (Table 5). Thus, richer winter assemblages of this type occurred in the more \"benign\" environments in terms of oxygen concentrations, the opposite of that found in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages. Winter oxygen levels were as low in Umbra-cyprinid lakes as in the depauperate centrarchid-Esox lakes, though they were apparently not as \"severe\" to the more tolerant Umbracyprinid species, and thus did not supress winter richness. This also implicates an \"intermediate\" disturbance mechanism operating to increase richness in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.Lake environments with low oxygen levels may be \"severe\" for the centrarchid-Esox species, reducing winter richness in the lakes themselves. However, the availability of stream/lake refuges may effectively eliminate any significant \"disturbance\" to the populations, so that when the fish return to the lake in the spring, the summer species richness of the lake returns to its relatively high level. Thus, although the seasonal richness patterns in the lakes themselves were measured to be unstable, the equilibria of the populations might be maintained.Insular factors.-The second factor included in the multiple regression analysis of richness in Umbra-cyprinid assemblages was surface area (Table 5). Barbour and Brown (1974) were the first to look at fish species richness in lakes as a problem of island biogeography. Their analysis of species-area curves, primarily in large lakes, yielded slopes of the log-log regressions that tended to be lower for lake fishes than for plants and animals on oceanic islands. They attributed this to either the relative homogeneity of lake environments as compared to isolated terrestrial habitats, and/ or to historical events that may tend to prevent large lakes from acquiring as many species as they can support ecologically.\n",

      "lakes3 text: The summer species-area slope for the Uinbra-cyprinid assemblages was 0.62, much higher than the range discussed by Barbour and Brown (1974) for assemblages with greater than equilibrial numbers of species. For centrarchid-Esox assemblages, the slope was 0.29, in the middle of the range noted by Barbour and Brown for lakes whose fish assemblages are in equilibrium between colonization and extinction.While the cause(s) of these different species-area relationships are not known, the values are consistent with the hypothesis that centrarchid-Esox assemblages are in ecological equilibrium, while disturbance-induced disequilibrium characterizes Umbra-cyprinid assemblages.Summer species richness in the centrarchid-Esox assemblages was also significantly related to the biogeographically important factor of insular connectedness (Table 5). A lake which has greater insular connectedness should have an increased immigration rate and a richer assemblage at equilibrium (Mac Arthur andWilson 1967, Magnuson 1976).\n",

      "In small seepage lakes with high winter oxygen levels, the top predator tends to be largemouth bass. The fish assemblages are similar in summer and winter (D). 7) Winter oxygen level is an important determinant of species richness in \"Umbra-cyprinid\" lakes in both summer and winter. The relationship is negative and suggests a disturbance-related mechanism operating to increase richness. The species-area slope for these assemblages also is consistent with the hypothesis that disturbance-induced rarefaction is maintaining greater than equilibrial numbers of species in the richer of these assemblages (I).8) Productivity, habitat complexity, and lake connectedness are significantly related to summer species richness in \"centrarchid-Esox\" lakes.These are basic components of equilibrium theories of diversity. The species-area slope of these assemblages is in the range of lakes whose fish assemblages are hypothesized to be at equilibrium (I).The identification of these assembly patterns describes what we feel are ecologically striking fish assemblage structures which appear to result from deterministic mechanisms of maintenance.Only now that these patterns have been described can meaningful, specific hypotheses be tested by intensive autecological or experimental studies.Lakecy z E &-^-' D u c* X ' t e 1.

An attempt was made to select lakes spanning a variety of surface areas while keeping maximum depths and predominant substrate types of all study lakes similar.### FIG. 2 .**Caption:** FIG. 2.

      "We examined 19 small, alkaline lakes (0.3-22 ha, median 10.5; 2.7-6.1 meq l -1 , median 2.6) located in calcareous, nutrient-rich moraines near the town of Hillerød in North Zealand, Denmark (Table 1). Mean pH-values in surface waters ranged from 7.2 to 8.2 because of CO 2 supersaturation and were markedly lower than the pH of 8.2-8.5 attained at CO 2 equilibrium with atmospheric air (Stumm and Morgan 1996). Land use was determined from air photographs in a 200 m zone around the lakes. Forest cover ranged from 1% to 96% among the lakes. Lakes were fed by groundwater, rainwater, and intermittent surface flow and, except for three lakes (that is, Slotssø, Teglga ˚rdssø, and Strødam Engsø) they lacked permanent stream inputs. Water residence time and loading with organic matter and nutrients were not known for most lakes. In small forest lakes, shed leaves were the main input of exogenous particulate organic matter. All lakes were shallow with mean depths ranging from 1 to 3.5 m. The water had measured mean vertical light attenuation coefficients (K D , 400-700 nm) ranging from 1.0 to 5.2 m -1 (Table 1). Light attenuation coefficients in all lakes on all sampling dates were calculated from measurements (see below) of total suspended dry matter (TSM), algal biomass (Chl a), and absorbance of colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) by applying the optical model described in Sand- Jensen and Staehr (2007). Small lakes surrounded by tall forest trees experience very pronounced shading from the trees. The reduction of surface irradiance (SI) has previously been quantified in the region as a function of lake size across the size range studied here (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). This model was used to calculate surface irradiance in the present set of lakes.\n",

      "Water Chemistry, Organic Matter, and Forest Cover\n",
      "All 19 small lakes had high nutrient concentrations (seasonal means: 25-285 lg TP l -1 , 521-2489 lg TN l -1 ) and phytoplankton biomasses (seasonal means: 8-100 lg Chl l -1 ) corresponding to mesotrophic to very eutrophic conditions (Figure 1). Nutrient concentrations (TN and TP) were higher (P < 0.088) in open lakes than in shaded forest lakes (Figure 1) and negative correlations of nutrient concentrations to forest cover among lakes were significant (Table 2). Total suspended matter (TSM) and phytoplankton biomass (Chl a) in pelagic water declined significantly with higher forest cover, whereas CDOM absorption, CDOM/Chl a, and free CO 2 concentrations increased (Table 2). Phytoplankton biomass increased significantly with TP (Table 2). All lakes were strongly supersaturated with CO 2 during autumn and winter, whereas CO 2 supersaturation during summer was weaker (Figure 1). CO 2 concentrations were lowest in forest lakes in early May and in open lakes in June-July. Among eight forest lakes, 97% of CO 2 measurements displayed supersaturation with an annual median value of about 975% air saturation. Among 11 open lakes, 87% of the measurements showed CO 2 -supersaturation and the annual median value was about 710% air saturation. O 2 concentrations in surface waters were greatly undersaturated during autumn and winter, close to atmospheric equilibrium in May and June, and only supersaturated in July (Figure 1). Forest lakes and open lakes were undersaturated with O 2 in 75% of measurements. The extent of CO 2 supersaturation was significantly positively correlated with the extent of O 2 undersaturation (Table 2).\n",

      "lakes2 text: Concentrations of free CO 2 declined significantly with TSM and increased highly significantly with CDOM absorption according to a hyperbolic relationship (Table 2, Figure 2). The range of mean CDOM absorption (6-34 m -1 ) among the lakes corresponds to dissolved organic carbon concentrations (DOC) between approximately 4 and 18 mg C l -1 according to the general empirical relationship of DOC to CDOM absorption (see section ''Materials and Methods''). In multiple regression analyses (log transformed data) only the positive relationship to CDOM contributed significantly to the prediction of daily mean CO 2 concentrations, whereas the positive influence of forest cover and the negative influence of phytoplankton biomass were not significant but may exert their influence through inter-correlations with CDOM.\n",

      "lakes2 text: ## Gas Fluxes and Net Heterotrophy\n",
      "Net heterotrophy was prominent as most of the lakes were supersaturated with CO 2 , undersaturated with O 2 , and had GPP/R COM -ratios below 1.0 during most of the year (Figures 1 and 4). Estimated CO 2 emissions were higher during autumn-winter than summer and annual mean CO 2 emission was 43.0 mol m -2 y -1 in forest lakes and 27.3 mol m -2 y -1 in open lakes (Table 3). Estimated influxes of O 2 were complementary to CO 2 emissions being higher during autumn-winter than summer and annual values were slightly higher in forest lakes (5.1 mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) than in open lakes (4.4 mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ). A highly significant inverse relationship was observed between CO 2 and O 2 fluxes among lakes over time in accordance with the complementary role of the two gases in photosynthesis and aerobic respiration (Figure 5). It is noteworthy, that a positive CO 2 -efflux was estimated at a zero O 2 -flux and that the slope of O 2 -flux versus CO 2 -flux was -0.41 and significantly less negative than -1.0 implying that, on a molar basis, estimated CO 2 emission was much higher than estimated O 2 uptake. Emission of CO 2 and uptake of O 2 both increased with falling GPP/R COM -ratio and more negative net ecosystem production (NEP = GPP -R COM ). The absolute rate of O 2 uptake from the atmosphere into the lakes is at the same level as the negative net ecosystem production, whereas the rate of CO 2 emission is much greater than what the surplus of community respiration can account for (Table 3).\n",

      "lakes2 text: ## DISCUSSION\n",
      "## Influence of Forest Cover and Dissolved Organic Matter\n",
      "The small lakes examined here exhibited significantly declining concentrations of nutrients and phytoplankton biomass with greater forest cover, whereas CDOM absorption and CO 2 supersaturation increased (Table 2). Input of soil nutrients is generally much lower in lakes located in forests than in open lakes located in cultivated landscapes (Larsen and others 1995). Input of leaves and dissolved organic matter, on the other hand, is high from forested catchments and can support microbial growth and microbial respiration in forest lakes contributing to their profound CO 2 supersaturation (Tranvik 1992). These conditions can account for the observed differences between forest lakes and open lakes. In addition, extra input of dissolved organic matter will impede phytoplankton biomass due to the enhanced background light attenuation which competes with phytoplankton pigments for available light as shown by phytoplankton growth models and laboratory tests under nutrient replete conditions (Huisman and Weissing 1994;Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998). In Long Lake, Wisconsin, for example, an increase of refractory Gross primary production (GPP, mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) 11.9 ± 6.5 14.1 ± 5.8 Community respiration (R com , mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) 22.0 ± 7.7 22.7 ± 7.9 Net ecosystem production (NEP, mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) -10.1 ± 2.1 -8.7 ± 3.8 GPP: R com 0.60 ± 0.07 0.76 ± 0.16 O 2 exchange rate (mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) -5.1 ± 2.9 -4.4 ± 2.6 CO 2 exchange rate (mol CO 2 m -2 y -1 ) 43.0 ± 15.0 27.3 ± 8.3\n",
      "Mean ± 95% CL. DOC from 5 to 17 mg l -1 , resembling the DOC range in our lake comparison, was estimated to reduce phytoplankton biomass and primary production corresponding to a 10-fold decline of the external P-loading rate (Carpenter and others 1998) because higher phytoplankton biomass (and more P) is required to absorb the same proportion of incident irradiance. In our lake comparison, CDOM absorption was negatively related to GPP/ R COM (Table 2). The quotient CDOM/Chl a directly reflects the competition between background absorption and photosynthetic pigment absorption (Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998) and it was significantly negatively related to GPP and GPP/ R COM (Table 2). We, therefore, agree with Pace and others (2007) that CDOM/Chl a could be a suitable and easily measurable predictor of the balance between allochthonous and autochthonous carbon to plankton consumers.\n",

      "lakes2 text: ## Lake Metabolism and Net Heterotrophy\n",
      "Community respiration exceeded gross primary production in all lakes stressing the net heterotrophic character of both nutrient-rich open lakes and forest lakes with high input of allochthonous organic carbon. Exogenous organic substrates offer an additional source to R COM that may explain why CO 2 is emitted to the atmosphere and O 2 is taken up and why their magnitudes are positively related to CDOM (Table 2, Figure 2). This finding corresponds well with the positive relationship of CO 2 to DOC of boreal lakes (Sobek and others 2005). Gross primary production and community respiration both increased significantly under more nutrient-rich conditions in lakes having high phosphorus and chlorophyll concentrations (Table 2). The close relationship of community respiration to phytoplankton biomass and production (Table 2, Figure 3) can result from a direct role of phytoplankton in the respiratory budget and an indirect role when phytoplankton carbon is consumed by bacteria and animals. GPP increased more than R COM by increasing nutrient richness supporting earlier suggestions of greater stimulation of autotrophy than heterotrophy (Schindler and others 1997;Cole and others 2000;Duarte and Prairie 2005). Uptake of O 2 from the atmosphere declined under more nutrient-rich conditions, though not significantly (P = 0.10).It is noteworthy that net ecosystem production remained negative in both open lakes (-8.7) and forest lakes (-10.1 mol O 2 m -2 y -1 ) consistent with GPP/R COM annual means of 0.76 and 0.60, respectively (Table 3). These annual balances are estimated by a combined optical-photosynthesis model using measurements of pelagic metabolism and attenuating TSM, CDOM, and Chl a on eight occasions during the year, but only one measurement series of benthic respiration. No contribution of benthic production was included. Despite these uncertainties, the calculations gain credibility by showing the same systematic pattern among lakes that all had negative NEP-values and of the same magnitude as O 2 influx from the atmosphere calculated independently.\n",

      "ponds3 text: Regardless of their areal extent, small ponds may be hotspots for carbon cycling. Small and shallow ponds receive high loadings of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) relative to their water volume, which increases respiration and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production (Hope et al. 1996;Kelly et al. 2001;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rubbo et al. 2006). Methane (CH 4 ) concentrations also tend to be greater in small ponds because more water is in contact with anoxic sediments and shallow waters reduce the amount of CH 4 oxidation that occurs between the sediments and surface waters (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). As CH 4 has a global warming potential about 25 times higher than CO 2 , its contribution to carbon budgets should not be overlooked (Bastviken et al. 2011).Although small, shallow ponds are abundant and may be highly saturated with carbon gases, few studies have evaluated the concentrations, fluxes, and drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 in very small ponds. The studies that have done so indicate that small ponds (B0.01 km 2 ) have some of the highest CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in both boreal and temperate regions (Table 1). Due to their high concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 , is possible that carbon flux from small ponds \\0.01 km 2 may match that of larger lakes on both a local (Abnizova et al. 2012) and a global (Torgersen and Branco 2008) scale.\n",

      "I sampled six temporary ponds in 2013 and five of the six in 2014 (Long Pond was removed from study in 2014 for a whole-ecosystem experiment) (Table 2). The study ponds are located within the Yale Myers Forest, a 3,213-ha research forest in Tolland and Windham Counties, Connecticut, USA. The ponds are located in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with minimal human disturbance. The forest composition surrounding the six ponds is primarily oak (Quercus rubra, Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and pine (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus). The soil types are Charlton-Chatfield Complex (Blacksmith, E8, Quarry, Woodpile Ponds) and Hinckley gravelly sandy loam (Long, Atwood Ponds), with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 %, except for E8 Pond where surrounding slopes range from 15 to 45 % (U.S. Department of Agriculture NRCS 1996). Temporary ponds like these are abundant throughout northern and eastern North America, with one to thirteen ponds per km 2 of undeveloped forest (Brooks et al. 1998;Capps et al. 2014;Palik et al. 2003;Wu et al. 2014). In this region, ponds typically fill with autumnal rains, freeze over the winter, thaw in early spring, and dry by late summer or early fall, although hydroperiod is sensitive to precipitation events. Five of the six study ponds dried in 2013 (all but Woodpile Pond) and all ponds dried in 2014. All six ponds are shallow (\\1 m), lack inlets and outlets, and have little emergent vegetation.\n",

Temperature and periphyton chlorophyll a are highly correlated (Table 3), meaning that if periphyton chlorophyll a is included in top models, it could also be interpreted as a possible temperature effect. Models were then fit with all remaining environmental variables (depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and precipitation).

Notably, temperature ranged from 7.1 to 22.2 °C and trophic status ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic within individual ponds (e.g. phytoplankton chlorophyll a range 0.2-65.1 lg L -1 in Atwood; TDP range 11.4-183.2 lg L -1 in Blacksmith). Dissolved oxygen was undersaturated at all sampling points, ranging from 3.0 to 74.7 %, indicating the ponds were net heterotrophic. There was also substantial between-pond variability (Table 2), with all of the environmental variables differing among ponds (ANOVA, p \\ 0.01) except for DO and temperature. Notably, DOC varied dramatically among ponds with maximum values ranging from 4.9 mg L -1 (Quarry Pond) to 38.4 mg L -1 (Blacksmith Pond).\n",

      "ponds3 text: The random effect of pond significantly improved models of CO 2 concentration and increased the best model's R 2 value from 0.23 to 0.60 (Table 4), indicating substantial between-pond variation. Blacksmith Pond had the highest CO 2 concentrations while Long and Woodpile Ponds had the lowest. Perhaps geology, groundwater inputs, turbulent differences, or another environmental variable not measured here played a role in between-pond differences. It is worth noting that while groundwater can be an important source of CO 2 in some freshwater systems (Humborg et al. 2010), there are several indications that groundwater is unlikely to play a major role in these ponds. First, the strong correlation between precipitation and depth (Table 3, r = 0.50) along with low conductivity (\\82 lS/cm) indicate that these ponds are fed by precipitation and not groundwater (Brooks 2004(Brooks , 2005;;Palik et al. 2001;Yoshikawa and Hinzman 2003). Additionally, there were no spikes in conductivity as the ponds dried, indicating that more water was lost to seepage than to evaporation and that the ponds recharged groundwater rather than drawing from it (Schneider and Frost 1996). As such, groundwater likely provides minimal CO 2 inputs to these temporary ponds, but there could be variation among sites.Year and sampling round had no significant effect on CO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 concentrations in these ponds were similar inter-and intra-annually. Jonsson et al. (2003) also found no seasonal effect on CO 2 concentrations across 16 Swedish lakes, hypothesizing that there was little metabolic change and that frequent mixing minimized seasonal changes in CO 2 concentrations. In the ponds studied here, metabolic activity likely increased with temperature as exhibited by seasonal increases in periphyton chlorophyll a. I hypothesize that CO 2 concentrations remained steady due to both polymictic mixing and high sediment respiration throughout the season. It is also possible that anaerobic breakdown of DOC and POC shifted more toward methanogenesis seasonally, which could reduce sediment CO 2 production and mask any seasonal increases in CO 2 that would occur if O 2 were more available.\n",

      "The strongest predictor of CH 4 concentrations in these temporary ponds was precipitation, with periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth being of secondary importance. Increased precipitation was associated with decreased CH 4 concentrations, a contrast with other studies where precipitation increased with CH 4 (Natchimuthu et al. 2014) and CO 2 (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;Roehm et al. 2009) concentrations or flux. In those studies, increased precipitation was associated with increased DOC in lakes likely due to increased runoff from the landscape (Einola et al. 2011;Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005). In this study, however, precipitation negatively correlated with DOC (Table 3, r = -0.45). Precipitation events likely influence small ponds differently than larger lakes because of their particular characteristics. Specifically, the volume of these small and shallow ponds responded dramatically to precipitation events. For instance, 21.7 cm of rainfall occurred during the first 2 weeks of June 2013 and as a result, pond depth increased by an average of 23.5 (±7.7 SE) cm (range 5-50 cm). Most ponds (five of the six) are located in defined basins, which prohibited areal expansion and led to dramatic increases in depth. For instance, Quarry and Long Ponds more than doubled in depth whereas Blacksmith Pond, the only pond able to significantly expand in area, only increased by 5 cm in depth.\n",

      "ponds3 text: As precipitation dramatically increased depth but not area in five of the six ponds, the relative depth (depth to surface area ratio) increased, causing a dilution effect for many of the pond's biological and chemical parameters. Specifically, increased precipitation correlated with decreased DOC, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDP, TDN, and temperature, and increased DO (Table 3). Many of these effects could alter CH 4 production and concentrations. For instance, DO is negatively correlated with CH 4 concentrations as anoxic sediments or waters are required for methanogenesis (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Methane concentrations are also affected by lake area and depth: small and shallow lakes have more water in contact with anoxic sediments, less opportunity for methane oxidation between the sediments and surface water, and a well-mixed water column that permits benthic CH 4 to reach the surface (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). Increased temperature also correlates with greater CH 4 concentrations as methanogenesis increases with temperature (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Interestingly, precipitation led to lower DOC in these ponds, implying an internal source of DOC (e.g. through leaf litter breakdown) that builds up between precipitation events and overmatches any DOC inputs from runoff. Overall, precipitation events dilute the biological and chemical parameters in small ponds, ultimately lowering CH 4 concentrations. In addition to dilution, precipitation also increases gas exchange rates (Ho et al. 1997(Ho et al. , 2000)), allowing O 2 to enter ponds and increasing efflux of CO 2 and CO 2 . The observed negative relationship between CH 4 concentrations and precipitation was therefore likely a result of both dilution and increased gas exchange.\n",

      "ponds3 text: Models predicting CH 4 concentrations also suggest that periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth were of secondary importance. Periphyton chlorophyll a was not significantly correlated with CH 4 , but did correlate highly with temperature, which was removed from models due to collinearity. As temperature correlated strongly with CH 4 , it is possible that periphyton is acting as a surrogate for temperature in the model, a plausible link as temperature increases methane production (Borrel et al. 2011;van Hulzen et al. 1999). Phytoplankton chlorophyll a also positively correlated with CH 4 concentration, likely because phytoplankton biomass increased with temperature and decreased with precipitation. Additionally, algal biomass is very labile and could provide another source of organic matter for decomposition. Lastly, depth improved model predictions, but its estimate included zero. It is likely that the model derived strength from the correlation between depth and precipitation.There was little between-pond variation in CH 4 concentrations and as such, the random effect of pond only increased the best model R 2 from 0.34 to 0.37 (Table 5). It is worth considering why between-pond variation was important for CO 2 and not for CH 4 . Methane concentrations were likely driven by precipitation, which was similar across all ponds (and imputed as the same number in models). In contrast, CO 2 concentrations were likely driven by sediment respiration, which was more variable among dates and ponds. Random effects of year and sampling round did also not improve CH 4 models, indicating that concentrations were similar between years and season, with major changes driven by precipitation.\n",

      "We studied lake metabolism in relation to physical, chemical and biological characteristics for about 1 week (6-8 days) in 25 medium to high alkaline lakes during May and June 2007. Systems ranged from ponds (0.1 ha) to midsized (1,729 ha) lakes, and were all located in calcareous moraines in Denmark (Table 1). Lakes were sampled in a random order to avoid bias from changing meteorological conditions during the study. Throughout the study, meteorological conditions were measured from a buoy placed on Lake Slotssø. Daily average wind speed (0.3-5.4 m s -1 , min-max) and solar irradiance (5-55 mol photons m -2 day -1 ) showed large daily variability, but did not change significantly during the course of the study. Lakes were chosen to cover large ranges in lake size, forest cover, TP, Chl and DOC concentrations. Lake area, catchment area, %forest cover in the catchment and drainage ratio (catchment area:lake area) were obtained for each lake using the digital Areal Information System (Nielsen et al. 2000). To evaluate effects of forest cover on local wind and light conditions, we also determined the proportion of forest in the 200 m wide riparian zone around the lakes from aerial photographs.\n",

      "We deployed a buoy at the centre of each lake to measure surface PAR, wind speed, water temperature and dissolved oxygen concentration (DO) for about 1 week. Three sets of this equipment were moved between lakes in a random order. Surface PAR was measured 1 m above the surface using a HOBO 2p quantum sensor. Wind speed was measured 1.2 m above the lake using a HOBO anemometer. Surface PAR and wind speed at the centre of each lake were normalized to measurements made throughout the summer in medium-sized Lake Slotssø (22 ha, 15% forest cover; Table 1). Normalization was simply the ratio of the wind speed at a lake to that of Lake Slotssø. This permitted comparison among the 25 lakes despite changes in mean weekly wind velocity and surface PAR during the summer. Water temperature was measured every 10 min during buoy deployment at several water depths, using a string of Stow Away Tidbit loggers. These data permitted calculation of mixing depth (Z mix ) at high frequency according to an empirical curve-fitting procedure (Staehr et al. 2010a). Dissolved oxygen was measured at 0.5 m either with an Oxyguard DO sensor or a YSI 600XL multisonde. Oxygen sensors were cleaned and calibrated prior and after each application. Electrode drift was small and was corrected for assuming it is linear over time. Oxygen concentrations recorded every 10 min were used to calculate NEP for 30 min intervals, according to the guidelines presented in Staehr et al. (2010b): NEP 30min = DO 2 -D/Z mix , where DO 2 (mmol O 2 m -3 30 min -1 ) is change in oxygen concentration over 30 min, D (mmol O 2 m -2 30 min -1 ) is exchange with the atmosphere in this period and Z mix (m) is mixing depth. Atmospheric exchange was calculated as\n",

      "The 25 lakes varied substantially in surface area (0.1-1,729 ha), mean depth (0.5-13.5 m), mixing depth (0.7-10.3 m; 12 out of 25 lakes were stratified) and forest cover in the catchment (1-91%; Table 1). Lake trophy ranged from mesotrophy to hypereutrophy and dystrophy according to the levels of TP (17-249 mg m -3 ), Chl (4-402 mg m -3 ), K D (0.5-5.7 m -1 ) and DOC (2.6-45.6 mg L -1 ; Table 1). Lakes were medium to high alkaline (ANC; 2.3 ± 0.1 mq L -1 mean ± SE) and usually supersaturated (22 lakes) with CO 2 (Table 1). With increasing lake surface area, lakes became deeper, had deeper mixing depth (Table 2), were more wind exposed and received more incident light (Fig. 1; Table 2).

      "Volumetric rates of GPP and R declined more than fivefold with increasing lake area, while correlations with forest cover were not significant (Fig. 4a-d; Table 2). NEP was negative in 14 lakes, positive in only two lakes and close to zero in the remaining 8 lakes (Fig. 4e, f). For one lake, sonde data were lost, and metabolic rates not calculated. NEP correlated with CO 2 saturation (r = -0.48, p = 0.02), and NEP became significantly more negative as lake area declined and forest cover and DOC increased (Table 2). Consequently, the most negative NEP rates were observed in DOC and CO 2 rich lakes smaller than 1 ha located in catchments dominated ([60%) by forest. Volumetric rates of GPP and R were significantly correlated with each other (r = 0.91, p = 0.006) and positively correlated with TP, Chl and DOC (Table 2). R increased significantly more than GPP with higher DOC concentrations, causing NEP to become significantly more negative and CO 2 super saturation to increase (Table 2). Correlations of GPP, R and NEP with lake surface area, water depth, drainage ratio and forest cover (only NEP) were often not as strong as correlations with intrinsic variables (e.g., TP, Chl and DOC) closely coupled to metabolic processes (Table 2).In contrast to the highly significant relationships of volumetric rates (mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 ) of GPP, R and NEP to lake size and catchment properties (only NEP), areal rates of metabolism (mmol O 2 m -2 day -1 ) were less strongly related to these meta-parameters and showed relationship with either DOC, TP or Chl (Table 2).\n",

      "lakes1 text: Day-to-day variability of GPP, R and NEP, can be described by the standard deviation (SD) of metabolism over the period of measurement and by the coefficient of variation being the standard deviation normalized to the mean (CV = SD/X mean ). Both in absolute (SD; r = -0.46, p = 0.02) and relative terms (CV; r = -0.44, p = 0.03; Fig. 5), the daily variability of GPP declined with lake area as we had anticipated and it was highest in small lakes receiving high inputs of exogenous nutrients and DOC.The influence of benthic processes on rates of wholelake metabolism was evaluated by subtracting measured pelagic rates (bottle incubations) from sonde based rates using the diel open water technique. According to the sonde-bottle estimates of GPP and R, the influence of benthic processes declined significantly with increasing lake area, water depth and drainage ratio (only R, but almost GPP), but showed no significant relationship to forest cover (Fig. 6a, b; Table 2). Since sonde estimates of whole-lake NEP were generally more negative than bottle estimates of pelagic NEP, the NEP sonde-bottle estimates were mostly negative (Fig. 6c; 19 lakes in total). As lake area and water depth increased, pelagic and whole-lake NEP rates became more similar causing the residual NEP estimates to approach zero (Fig. 6c). This result suggests that benthic processes become less important for the net metabolic balance as lake area and water depth increased (Fig. 6; Table 2).

      "lakes1 text: The relative importance of lake meta-parameters and intrinsic biological and physical drivers for weekly averages of volumetric rates of GPP, R, and NEP was evaluated by multiple regression analysis. Among meta-parameters, mean lake depth was the best predictor of GPP and R, and both decreased with increasing water depth. A combination of lake area and %forest cover was the best predictor of NEP (Table 3A). Light and temperature did not contribute significantly to explain between lake variability in GPP, R or NEP, suggesting that differences in these drivers were small and unimportant across the studied lakes during the study period (Table 3B). Algal biomass (Chl) was, as expected, the best predictor of GPP, while high rates of respiration and strong net heterotrophy (NEP \\ 0) were both related to high DOC (Table 3B). Evaluating the combined effect of meta-parameters and biological and physical conditions on weekly rates of whole lake metabolism, showed that GPP increased with higher algal biomass and lower water depth (Table 3C). Similarly, respiration increased with DOC and decreased with water depth. Variations in NEP were best explained by DOC, with no significant contributions from either lake size or forest cover. Thus, except for NEP, combining metaparameters with internal biological drivers raised the overall explanatory power (r 2 ) of variations in lake metabolism by 14-15% to 57-63% (Table 3C).\n",

      "Physico-chemical features in 25 medium to high alkaline Danish lakes varied significantly with lake size and differences in forest cover of the catchments (Table 1). In agreement with previous studies, surface irradiance and wind exposure increased with lake surface area, but decreased with increasing shelter and shading from the Fig. 6 Difference between sonde and bottle based metabolic rates and its relationships to lake area. The difference between whole-lake metabolic estimates, determined using the open water diel O 2 technique (sonde), and pelagic metabolism calculated from oxygen changes in bottles, is used to represent an effect of benthic metabolism. As lakes become larger, the effect of benthic metabolism (mainly respiration) becomes less important and the difference between NEP derived from sondes and bottles decreases. Data are averages over 6-8 days. Filled circles are fully-mixed lakes and open circles represent thermally stratified lakes forest surrounding the lakes (Fee et al. Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). Also, small surface areas were, as expected, statistically linked to shallow water and shallow mixing depth (Strasbaska 1980;Duarte and Kalff 1989;Fee et al. 1996). Our findings that small lakes are generally richer in nutrients, algal biomass, dissolved organic matter and CO 2 than large lakes located in the same surroundings, likewise agree well with previous broad-scale comparisons (Søndergaard et al. 2005;Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007;Hanson et al. 2007;No ˜ges 2009).\n",

      "lakes1 text: The fluorescence index (FI) as derived by McKnight et al. (2001) suggested that not only does the amount of DOC vary notably across the studied lakes, but the quality (or origin) of the DOC varies as well (Fig. 3e, f). In agreement with expectations, we found that small lakes tend to contain more terrestrial material, whereas autochthonous production was a more important DOC source in larger lakes. The low FI in algal rich small lakes (Table 2) show that the terrestrial input of DOC is much higher than the input of DOC from degrading or leaking phytoplankton. Although large lakes do receive allochthonous DOC, its signal is overwhelmed by the production of Table 3 Stepwise multiple linear regression models of volumetric (mmol O 2 m -3 day -1 ) rates of GPP, R and NEP as a function of (A) Lake meta-parameters: lake area, mean water depth and %forest cover in the lake catchment, and (B) Biological and physical drivers: Chl, DOC, E mean and water temperature, and (C) a combination of lake meta-parameters and, biological and physical drivers autochthonous DOC and the greater exposure to photochemical and microbial degradation as a of longer residence times (Lindell et al. 2000).\n",

      "With increasing lake area, water depth tends to increase and the relative influence of benthic primary production can be expected to decrease as light becomes more limiting (Kemp et al. 1992). Although the importance of benthic primary producers is expected to be higher in shallow systems, poor light conditions associated with eutrophication may switch the dominance from benthic to pelagic processes (Vadeboncoeur et al. 2003). Our lakes were all placed in medium to high alkaline, nutrient-rich catchments, with relatively poor light conditions for benthic plant growth even in shallow lakes (See Table 1). Except for a few shallow lakes, most of our lakes had little submerged vegetation, and the benthic zone was accordingly dominated by carbon-rich and oxygen demanding sediments (author, pers obs), suggesting dominance of heterotrophic processes in the benthic environment. In support of this, we generally found higher sonde based (*whole-lake) than bottle based (*pelagic) respiration rates, especially so in small and shallow lakes (Table 2; Fig. 6b). Also the difference between sonde and bottle based NEP declined with increasing lake depth (Table 2) and area (Fig. 6c), indicating the influence of benthic processes on whole-lake metabolism to decrease with increasing lake size.\n",

      "lakes1 text: ## Areal versus volumetric rates\n",
      "In agreement with expectations, the implicit scaling was much weaker for areal than volumetric rates, and only GPP was significantly related to lake area (Table 2). Weak or absent relations to areal rates may derive from the confounding effect of co-variation of lake surface area and water depth. However, light utilization for photosynthesis per unit area is also known to be relatively similar among different plant communities and among systems of different depth (Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998), and shallow lakes can accordingly be viewed as a compressed version of deeper lakes (Brylinsky and Mann 1973;Krause-Jensen and Sand-Jensen 1998) with little differences in areal rates of productivity.Comparison of lake productivity amongst contrasting lakes can also be obtained by normalizing GPP to phytoplankton biomass, which serves as an index of the growth potential of algae (Staehr and Sand-Jensen 2007). For the lakes in this study, chlorophyll specific GPP decreased significantly with increasing TP concentration (r = -0.42, p \\ 0.05), while it increased with increasing mean light availability (r = 0.47, p \\ 0.05). These findings suggest that the efficiency of nutrient use of the autotrophic community increases with the degree of nutrient limitation, and that light availability is more important than nutrient availability for variation of primary production. Considering that the mean available irradiance (a function of surface irradiance, light attenuation and mixing depth) was unrelated to lake area and depth (Table 2), it is not surprising that areal rates of GPP, R and NEP show weak dependencies of lake morphometry.\n",

      "Parameters were recorded in the field, measured and/or calculated in the laboratory (Table 2). Independent environmental variables were tested for their significance in shaping aquatic macrophyte species composition. These variables can be classified into three groups [38]: quantitative variables, semiquantitative estimates, and categorical variables. Quantitative variables include morphometric parameters of the specific pond (length, width or diameter (m), surface (m 2 ), depth (m), approximate volume (m 3 ), surface:depth ratio (S/d)), and water quality parameters (pH, temperature (T), conductivity (EC), O 2 concentration, O 2 saturation, transparency, chlorophyll-a). Semiquantitative estimates include habitat characteristics (land-use of the catchment, bottom substrate, shore substrate, type of vegetation in banktop zone, width of woody and/or wetland banktop zone). Categorial variables include data about the presence/absence of: fish, filamentous algae, slime, woody species in the pond.Water samples were taken from each pond in August 2009. The majority of the water quality parameters (pH, O 2 concentration, O 2 saturation, T and EC of water) were measured in situ using the portable multi-meter PCD 650 (Eutech Instruments, Singapore). Water transparency and concentration of chlorophyll-a were analyzed spectrophotometrically in the laboratory on the same day.Habitat characteristics were assessed as semiquantitative estimates in a similar way as in many studies of aquatic ecosystems [39][40][41]. The estimated gradients were as follows:\n",

      "Detrended correspondence analysis (DCA) was used for exploratory data analysis. The eigenvalue for the first DCA axis was greater than 0.4 and indicated strong unimodality [42], therefore canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) was chosen. Relationships between site conditions and vegetation were analyzed using direct gradient analysis (CCA). Separate CCAs for each environmental variable were performed to test the significance of its influence and the explanation of species composition variation. The analysis was run with scaling for inter-sample distances, and bi-Table 2.

Forward selection of explanatory variables was used to provide a ranking of the relative importance of the specific variables and to avoid co-linearity [43]. We used the unrestricted Monte Carlo test with 999 permutations to test the statistical significance of the variables and canonical axes. Another CCA was done with a subset of selected variables only (p<0.1), and the proportions of variance explained by these variables were calculated. Some of the variables were not normally distributed so the data were log transformed. Ordination of the ponds according to the most important environmental parameters was made using CCA. The whole set of analyses was performed using CANOCO 4.5 [44]. Differences in environmental parameters between ponds with and without macrophytes were tested for significance using t-test. Species richness was correlated with environmental parameters using Spearman coefficient in SPSS version 17.\n",

      "A preliminary DCA revealed a first gradient length of 6.49 SD, which indicates strong unimodality, so CCA was chosen. Separate CCAs for each environmental variable revealed that some of the variables influence floristic composition significantly: fish presence, water transparency, pH, land-use of the catchment, and shore substrate.Analysis with forward selection provided a ranking of the relative importance of the specific significant variables (Table 4).The presence of fish, water transparency, pH, land-use of the catchment area of the pond, and shore substrate were revealed to be the most influential factors determining aquatic macrophyte communities, explaining species variation significantly. These variables explain 32% of the total variation of the data set. CCA with these five variables (Table 4) was performed, allowing the distribution of the ponds according to floristic composition along the most important environmental gradients to be shown in an ordination diagram (Fig. 1). Ponds with prevailing hydrophytes are distributed on the upperright side of the diagram in the direction of fish presence (and transparency), which indicates oxic conditions throughout the year in the permanent water phase. Hypoxic conditions normally occur in ponds with a strong input of allochthonous leaf litter in autumn. Species-rich ponds with abundant emergent and marsh species are distributed in the lower-left part of the diagram in the direction of finer shore substrate, enabling the growth of the mentioned species. Arrows representing water transparency and land-use indicate relative correlation that was expected, since the higher proportion of forest or permanent grassland in the catchment area of a pond would result in clearer water.Species number was significantly correlated with surface/depth ratio, shore substrate, surface area of the pond and width of littoral zone (Table 5). The ponds with loamy shores and/or wider littoral zone were not only richer in total species number, but also harboured more Red list species, which were also more abundant.\n",

In addition, Cloeon dipterum and Caenis horaria, the two most abundant species present in many lowland ponds, were much less common at these altitudes. Indeed, most of the mayflies that are present in the subalpine and alpine belts were rare species.A between-class Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed to test if there was an overall difference between the ponds containing Caenidae + Baetidae (33 ponds) and those with Baetidae only (31 ponds) for 12 relevant selected environmental and physico-chemical variables. Three of these variables were log-transformed: area, mean depth and sinuosity of the shoreline; five were transformed in categories: TP, TN, conductivity, transparency and altitudinal vegetation belt; and the last four were not transformed: presence versus absence of fishes, % of natural zone surrounding the waterbody, % of catchment area and macrophytes species richness.\n",

      "## Ephemeroptera species distribution in ponds\n",
      "Mayflies were found to be present in 76 of the 104 sampled ponds. Of the 85 species (and 11 families) of Ephemeroptera present in Switzerland, 12 species from five families were identified (Table 3). This list included logically a majority of lentic species; however, lotic species were also found to be present (i.e. Baetis rhodani, Centroptilum luteolum, Ephemera danica and Siphlonurus aestivalis), which could be explained by the presence of tributaries. The lotic species Baetis alpinus was additionally found in one alpine pond, and this independently of the presence of a tributary. An explanation for the presence of lotic species in lentic ecosystem is that in alpine ponds, the physico-chemical conditions (oxygen, nutrient content, T °C) are similar to those observed in streams (Hieber et al., 2005).Amongst the 12 identified species, four are mentioned in the red list of threathened species for Switzerland (Sartori et al., 1994): Centroptilum luteolum, Cloeon simile, Ephemera danica (all three potentially endangered) and Siphlonurus aestivalis (endangered). The finding of Habrophlebia fusca was a first for Switzerland, while Habrophlebia lauta was observed for the first time in the Canton of Graubu ¨nden.The 28 ponds where Ephemeroptera were absent included a set of ponds situated at an altitude over 1,410 m (22 ponds) or another set with hypertrophic conditions (six ponds). However, mayflies were not always absent from ponds with hypertrophic conditions. Baetidae were observed in 26 hypertrophic ponds, and of these, 15 ponds also contained Caenidae. Likewise, mayflies were not always absent from ponds over an altitude of 1,410 m: nine ponds over 1,410 m contained mayflies, mostly from the Baetidae or Caenidae families.\n",

      "definitions1 text: When present in a pond, the Ephemeroptera community diversity was low (see Table 3 and Fig. 1) and composed of only a few taxa (mean species number = 1.9 and mean family number = 1.6). The dominant lentic species were Cloeon dipterum (in 93% of the ponds containing Ephemeroptera) and Caenis horaria (in 45%). In 43% of the cases, ponds included only one family, generally the Baetidae with, in most of these cases, Cloeon dipterum being found alone. Otherwise, there was one case each where Cloeon simile was found alone or both together with Cloeon dipterum. For 55% of the ponds containing Ephemeroptera, two families were recorded, with Baetidae (Cloeon dipterum) present in all cases. One pond included three families. Therefore, Baetidae appeared as the most common mayfly family to be found in Swiss ponds. An interesting observation was that Caenidae were only present when Baetidae were present (with one exception). However, considering the selected environmental and physico-chemical variables, these were found to have no relevance in differentiating the ponds between sites with the presence of both Baetidae and Caenidae and sites with Baetidae alone. Only 3% of the variability given by the between-class PCA could be explained by environmental and physico-chemical variables. The Monte Carlo Pvalue was not significant for the parameters tested (P = 0.654).\n",

Nevertheless the relationship between TP and Cloeon dipterum was near to being significant (P = 0.085).There was also no significant difference of the mayfly species richness present between the groups of ponds based upon their trophic state (TP, TN or conductivity).

Table 5 presents the most relevant variables (two variables for Cloeon dipterum, four for Caenis horaria) retained in the two final regression models at P = 0.05 level and their relative contributions. Cross-validation ratios were high for both models, with r above 0.7. Consequently, regarding r 2 values, more than 50% of the species' distribution could be explained by the two, respectively the four variables retained in the models. The models explained between 14.6% and 32.1% of the deviance for Cloeon dipterum and Caenis horaria respectively. The response curves for the variables retained in the models are presented in Fig. 3. Confidence intervals were usually wider at both ends of all gradients where there were fewer observations. For both species, the regression models showed one similar trend: the linear positive influence of area. This finding indicates that the two species were more frequently associated with larger sized ponds than with smaller ones. Also for both species, the trophic state of the pond was a significant variable, although the shape of the response curve was different for each species explaining that Caenis horaria was mostly present in oligotrophic ponds, while Cloeon dipterum was associated mainly with eutrophic ponds. The model for Caenis horaria incorporated two more variables: mean depth which showed a complex response curve that seemed incoherent; and macrophytes species richness which showed a bell-shaped response curve: Caenis horaria seemed therefore to be associated with species-rich ponds.\n",

      "Ephemeroptera species distribution in ponds\n",
      "The Ephemeroptera are particularly well represented, being observed in 93% of the lowland ponds (colline and montane). Nevertheless, in terms of species richness, they are relatively poorly represented (mean species number = 1.9). This is mainly due to the fact that most mayflies are adapted to living in running waters where the environmental conditions are drastically different from those of standing waters. Both Caenidae and Baetidae families contain some of the most resistant species to organic pollution and to low levels of oxygen (Macan, 1973;Bro ¨nmark & Hansson, 2000). Two species dominate our data group: Cloeon dipterum and Caenis horaria, both of which are known to be very resistant to eutrophic conditions (group 6 in Solda ´n et al., 1998, or groups E-G in Kelly-Quinn & Bracken, 2000). Only a few additional mayfly species could potentially be observed in Swiss ponds. These are: n, number of ponds where the species was present. area = log e transformed m 2 ; total phosphorus (TP) = transformed into one of the four trophic categories as described by OECD (1982); mean depth = log e transformed cm; macrophyte species richness = not transformed Fig. 3 Response curves for the variables incorporated in the Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) calculated for the presence of (a) Cloeon dipterum and (b) Caenis horaria. The dashed lines are approximate 95% confidence intervals around the smooth function lines. area = log e transformed m 2 ; total phosphorus (TP) = transformed into one of the four trophic categories as described by OECD (1982); mean depth = log e transformed cm; macrophyte species richness = not transformed.

      "Leptophlebia marginata, Leptophlebia verspertina, Rhithrogena loyolaea (above altitude of 2,800 m), Ephemera glaucops (recently discovered in one location in eastern Switzerland); Ecdyonurus sp. (in drift conditions or at altitude), Paraleptophlebia werneri (elsewhere) and perhaps Arthroplea congener (although at present only found in Germany and Austria). Interestingly, all these species mentioned are rare species and found in special conditions. Many of our observations include new localities for Switzerland's Ephemeroptera, and therefore will contribute to the updating of the geographical distribution of the species presented in Sartori and Landolt (1999). Furthermore, altitudinal ranges presented by these authors will be largely revised, with new data for 7 out of the 12 species found in the sampled ponds (see Table 3).\n",
