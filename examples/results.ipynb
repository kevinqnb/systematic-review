      "Growing urbanization and climate variability have placed immense pressure on the finite supply of groundwater available for agricultural irrigation. As a result, the exploration of alternative irrigation water sources, including recycled water and pond water, has become a global priority (Scheierling et al., 2006;Parsons et al., 2010;Ortega-Reig et al., 2014). While there is no universal standard, ponds are generally defined as small (1 m 2 to ∼50,000 m 2 ), shallow, standing water bodies that can either permanently or temporarily collect freshwater (Biggs et al., 2005;De Meester et al., 2005;Céréghino et al., 2008). These small water bodies are known to house a rich tapestry of aquatic plant and macroinvertebrate species, even greater than that of other larger water bodies (e.g., lakes and rivers) (Biggs et al., 2005). Moreover, the high terrestrial and aquatic interchange of ponds may enable both small free-living (<1 µm) and large/particleassociated bacteria to proliferate (Søndergaard et al., 2005;Roiha et al., 2016). Therefore, assessing the microbial diversity and interactions of these complex water bodies is a critical first step with regard to completing a comprehensive characterization of pond biodiversity, and evaluating the suitability of pond freshwater for agricultural applications, such as the irrigation of food crops.\n",

      "'Small waterbodies' is an ambiguous term with, as yet, no universally accepted or legal definition. In this paper, we use the term to refer to ponds and small lakes, small streams including headwaters, ditches and springs. In the following section, the approaches which have been taken to derive these definitions are described.## Ponds and small lakes\n",
      "Ponds are small standing waters varying in size from 1 m 2 to about 2-5 ha in area and may be permanent or seasonal, man-made or naturally created (Pond Conservation Group, 1993;Collinson et al., 1995;Biggs et al., 2007;E.P.C.N., 2007;Cereghino et al., 2008). Although there is a long history, dating back to the nineteenth century, of attempts to define the difference between a pond and a lake (Biggs et al., 2005), large ponds and small lakes share many characteristics in terms of structure and function, and the transition zone between the two types of habitat is very gradual (Søndergaard et al., 2005;De Meester et al., 2005). Indeed, ponds merge imperceptibly into virtually all other freshwater habitat types (Biggs et al., 1997). However, for practical purposes, such as estimating waterbody numbers or comparing waterbody types, most authors have adopted a size-based classification with a size boundary somewhere between 1 and 5 ha, which can be fairly easily measured in the field (e.g. Williams et al., 2004;Kalettka & Rudat, 2006;Davies et al., 2008a, b;De Bie et al., 2008;Williams et al., 2010a). Occasionally, 'pond' studies are restricted to waters of no more than 0.5 ha (e.g. Lafitte et al., 2009) or extended to include those up to 8 m in depth or 10 ha in area (e.g. Oertli et al., 2000Oertli et al., , 2005)). The Ramsar Convention adopted a cut-off between ponds and lakes of 8 ha, although in practice this has not been widely applied by workers investigating these\n",

However, we lack detailed understanding of the relative importance of specific stressors and the mechanisms through which they operate in ponds. For small lakes, in contrast, including those in the 5-10 ha size range (Sayer et al., 2010), there are a wide range of studies investigating the importance of a range of stressors, and many detailed studies of the processes which those stressors influence. These have led to well-developed conceptual models of the effects of stressors on lakes (see Fig. 4).\n",

      "## Introduction\n",
      "Despite the growth of interest in, and understanding of, small waters, much 'basic' science remains to be done. Gaps in our understanding include quite fundamental aspects of function and structure: for example, the hydrology, geochemical processes, assemblages of organisms and the population ecology of the species that make up those assemblages all remain poorly studied. Other than for the large and obvious macroinvertebrates, macrophytes and amphibians, even basic inventories are lacking for algae and other microorganisms, microcrustaceans, non-vascular plants, Diptera (which make up about half of all larger invertebrates in small waterbodies) and the semiterrestrial invertebrate fauna in small waterbodies. The role of small waters as refuges for freshwater biodiversity and techniques for protecting that biodiversity all remain relatively under-researched even though these waterbodies are some of the most tractable when it comes to tackling the main impacts of human activity on freshwaters. Perhaps, the most important need is for more studies comparing different types of waterbody, large and small. This approach has proved fruitful for understanding freshwater biodiversity in ponds, but has been adopted to a very limited extent in virtually all other studies of the structure and function of freshwaters (for a recent exception, see Schriever & Lytle, 2016). However, we anticipate that for many aspects of practical freshwater biodiversity conservation, and the understanding of ecosystem services, such comparative studies will be vital.Despite the work of pioneers of freshwater ecology, like Charles Elton, who produced the first categorisation of freshwater habitats (for Elton, ponds were waterbodies less than 1 acre (Elton & Miller, 1954)), TT 'Kit' Macan (Macan, 1973) and Jack Talling (Talling, 1951), the study of ponds became a backwater in the second half of the twentieth century, really only gaining momentum in the twentyfirst century, in Europe particularly as a result of the work of the European Pond Conservation Network (Oertli et al., 2009) and in North America by ecologists interested in wetlands (e.g. Batzer et al., 1999;Batzer & Boix, 2016).\n",

      "Ponds are small lentic ecosystems that permanently or temporarily hold water [1]. They are shallow and their size ranges from a few square metres to several hectares. They can be natural or man-made. Their number is much higher than that of large lakes, which constitute a small percentage of the total number of lakes [2]. Despite this, studies of lentic ecosystems have concentrated mainly on moderately large lakes [2].Ponds differ functionally from larger lakes [3], since their littoral structure and its productivity dominates the ecosystem [2]. Despite their small size they contain a significant part of aquatic biodiversity on the landscape scale [4,5]. Humans have created millions of ponds for multiple purposes [2], but today they serve as refugia for a variety of freshwater biota [5] and are, as such, an irreplaceable type of habitat [6][7][8].The biotic communities that develop in ponds depend on environmental conditions and human activity. Several studies document clear associations between the communities and a variety of environmental gradients, such as hydro-period [9,10], surface area [11], and water properties like water transparency, nutrient availability, and pH [12][13][14]. Compared to rivers and lakes, ponds exhibit greater environmental and, consequently, biotic amplitudes [15].\n",

      "Twenty-eight karst ponds were investigated in the Karst region in SW Slovenia. The ponds are distributed on the Karst Plateau along the border with Italy (from 13º38'08'' E, 45º50'43'' N to 13º59'36'' E, 45º39'54'' N) (Table 1). The climate is sub-Mediterranean, annual precipitation is 1,500 mm [32] (about two-fold higher than evapotranspiration). The largest amount of precipitation occurs in November, and the least in the peak of the vegetation period in July [32]. The mean annual temperature is 11ºC [33]. The altitude ranges from 195 to 420 m a.s.l.## Aquatic Macrophyte Survey\n",

      "The whole pond was a sampling unit. Plants were identified using the following keys: Martinčič et al. [35] and Preston [36]. Plants whose reproductive organs were not present at the time of sampling are listed by genus (e.g. Bidens, Epilobium, Sparganium). The survey was performed in July and August in 2009. The nomenclature of ferns and flowering plants follows Martinčič et al. [35]. The definition of aquatic macrophytes is in accordance with Hutchinson [37] and Wetzel [2], therefore woody species and other non-hygrophilous species were excluded from analyses.Plant species richness in the ponds was calculated as species number (N) per surface area and/or approximate volume of the studied water bodies.\n",
