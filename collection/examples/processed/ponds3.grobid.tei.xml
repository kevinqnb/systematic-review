<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle, but there is a poor understanding of carbon dynamics in very small ponds. In this study, I evaluated the concentrations and drivers of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) in six small (\1000 m 2 ), temporary, forested ponds in Connecticut, USA. The six ponds were on average 19-fold supersaturated in CO 2 and 504-fold supersaturated in CH 4 relative to the atmosphere. For both gases, this level of supersaturation is among the highest reported for lentic freshwaters. The physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the ponds differ from larger lakes, and may explain the supersaturation. Specifically, the ponds have high terrestrial carbon loadings, are shallow, and polymictic, meaning much of the water is in contact with the carbon-rich sediments. Pond CO 2 concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that substantial respiration, likely from the sediments, drew down oxygen (O 2 ) and produced CO 2 . The stoichiometric relationship between CO 2 supersaturation and O 2 undersaturation also implicates anaerobic respiration as a significant source of CO 2 production in the ponds. The high carbon, low oxygen, and shallow nature of small ponds were also prime for CH 4 supersaturation. Methane concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with precipitation, likely because precipitation increased pond depth, diluted dissolved organic carbon and gas concentrations, and increased DO. If the respiration of terrestrial carbon in small ponds is not accounted for in carbon budgets, current estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may be overestimated.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Inland waters play an important role in the global carbon cycle. While estimated to comprise only 2.2-3.7 % of the earth's non-glaciated land area <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Raymond et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Verpoorter et al. 2014)</ref>, inland waters process the same amount of carbon as both net terrestrial productivity and net oceanic uptake <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Aufdenkampe et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Battin et al. 2009</ref>). Yet, estimates of global carbon flux from inland waters are ridden with uncertainty <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(Raymond et al. 2013)</ref> and finer-scale studies are needed to determine carbon concentrations in global waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Battin et al. 2009)</ref>.</p><p>One source of uncertainty in global carbon budgets is the role of small ponds. The majority of studies on carbon cycling in lentic systems have focused on medium-to large-sized lakes. Yet the vast majority of ponds and lakes are small: over 90 % of all ponds and lakes are\0.01 km 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Downing et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Verpoorter et al. 2014)</ref>, not including very small ponds (0.0001-0.001 km 2 ) which could number as high as 3.2 billion and cover 0.8 million km 2 of surface area <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Downing 2010)</ref>. However, small ponds\0.1 km 2 are difficult to map <ref type="bibr">(Lehner and Do ¨ll 2004)</ref> and even highresolution satellite images cannot accurately identify ponds\0.002 km 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">(Verpoorter et al. 2014)</ref>. Due to the uncertainty of their distribution, very small ponds (\0.001 km 2 ) remain difficult to assess in regional and global biogeochemical models, and are excluded.</p><p>Regardless of their areal extent, small ponds may be hotspots for carbon cycling. Small and shallow ponds receive high loadings of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) relative to their water volume, which increases respiration and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hope et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kelly et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kortelainen et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Rubbo et al. 2006)</ref>. Methane <ref type="bibr">(CH 4</ref> ) concentrations also tend to be greater in small ponds because more water is in contact with anoxic sediments and shallow waters reduce the amount of CH 4 oxidation that occurs between the sediments and surface waters <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bastviken et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Juutinen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kankaala et al. 2013)</ref>. As CH 4 has a global warming potential about 25 times higher than CO 2 , its contribution to carbon budgets should not be overlooked <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bastviken et al. 2011)</ref>.</p><p>Although small, shallow ponds are abundant and may be highly saturated with carbon gases, few studies have evaluated the concentrations, fluxes, and drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 in very small ponds. The studies that have done so indicate that small ponds (B0.01 km 2 ) have some of the highest CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in both boreal and temperate regions (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Due to their high concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 , is possible that carbon flux from small ponds \0.01 km 2 may match that of larger lakes on both a local <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abnizova et al. 2012</ref>) and a global <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Torgersen and Branco 2008)</ref> scale.</p><p>Yet the paucity of studies on carbon dynamics in small ponds, particularly in temperate regions, limits our understanding of inland water carbon cycling. It is imperative to know both the concentrations and mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturation in small freshwaters. As very small ponds have unique chemical, physical, and biological parameters, the drivers of carbon concentrations may differ from larger lakes. For instance, high carbon loading, shallow waters, and frequent mixing could lead to different mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 production in small ponds compared to larger lakes. Furthermore, small pond carbon dynamics may be more sensitive than larger lakes to seasonal and annual variation, such as temperature changes and water availability. Carbon cycling provides valuable knowledge on pond and lake biology, which is important considering the vast majority of the world's ponds and lakes are very small. Additionally, understanding the drivers and concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small ponds will inform local, regional, and global carbon budgets.</p><p>This study examines the carbon dynamics of six very small (\0.001 km 2 ), temporary ponds in Connecticut, USA across the open water season and across two years. The goals of the study were (1) to quantify the concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small, temporary, and temperate ponds and (2) to identify the local drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Study sites and sampling</head><p>I sampled six temporary ponds in 2013 and five of the six in 2014 (Long Pond was removed from study in 2014 for a whole-ecosystem experiment) (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). The study ponds are located within the Yale Myers Forest, a 3,213-ha research forest in Tolland and Windham Counties, Connecticut, USA. The ponds are located in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with minimal human disturbance. The forest composition surrounding the six ponds is primarily oak (Quercus rubra, Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and pine (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus). The soil types are Charlton-Chatfield Complex (Blacksmith, E8, Quarry, Woodpile Ponds) and Hinckley gravelly sandy loam (Long, Atwood Ponds), with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 %, except for E8 Pond where surrounding slopes range from 15 to 45 % (U.S. Department of Agriculture NRCS 1996). Temporary ponds like these are abundant throughout northern and eastern North America, with one to thirteen ponds per km 2 of undeveloped forest <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Brooks et al. 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Capps et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Palik et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">Wu et al. 2014)</ref>. In this region, ponds typically fill with autumnal rains, freeze over the winter, thaw in early spring, and dry by late summer or early fall, although hydroperiod is sensitive to precipitation events. Five of the six study ponds dried in 2013 (all but Woodpile Pond) and all ponds dried in 2014. All six ponds are shallow (\1 m), lack inlets and outlets, and have little emergent vegetation.</p><p>I sampled ponds for CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations biweekly from after ice-out in April until the ponds began to dry mid-to late-July. Dry date differed by ponds and among years, allowing up to 9 sampling rounds for each pond in 2013 and up to eight sampling rounds in 2014. In addition to gas concentrations, I measured depth, water temperature, percent dissolved oxygen (DO) (ProODO, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA), pH, and conductivity (Waterproof Multiparameter PCS Testr 35, Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA) biweekly. I also took biweekly samples for chlorophyll a from periphyton growing attached to glass slides (Periphyton Sampler, Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) and from surface water for phytoplankton. Once per month I took water samples to measure total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Samples were taken from surface waters near Z max . For gas concentrations, I took two samples at Z max and in all but the smallest pond (Quarry Pond), I took two additional samples at either end of the pond to account for spatial variability.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Gas concentrations</head><p>Water samples were collected from 5 to 10 cm below the surface of the water using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex E/S Portable Sampler, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). I collected water in glass BOD bottles, flushed at least twice by their volume while ensuring that no bubbles were produced. I then extracted 110 mL of water using a 140-mL plastic syringe with a three-way stopcock, also being careful to not produce bubbles. I immediately added 30 mL of N 2 , and shook the syringe vigorously for two 2 min to ensure gas equilibrium. I then extracted 15 mL of headspace and stored it in a 12-mL evacuated vial (839 W Exetainer, Labco Limited, Lampeter, UK) until analysis.</p><p>Headspace concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 were measured by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector fit with a methanizer (Shimadzu GC2014, Kyoto, Japan) and calculated using standard curves. Concentrations of gases dissolved in water were corrected for dilution and calculated according to Henry's law using values for CO 2 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Weiss (1974)</ref> and for CH 4 from <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Wiesenburg and Guinasso (1979)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Water chemistry</head><p>Glass slides for periphyton chlorophyll a were scraped, rinsed with water, and the resulting periphyton-water slurry was filtered onto pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and frozen until analysis. Water samples for phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and DOC were pre-filtered through 150 lm mesh to remove zooplankton and debris. Water samples for phytoplankton chlorophyll a were then filtered onto pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and frozen until analysis. Periphyton and phytoplankton chlorophyll a was measured from the filters using a fluorometer (TD-700 Fluorometer, Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, California, USA) following Environmental Protection Agency Method 445.0. Water samples for TDN, TDP, and DOC were filtered through pre-combusted Whatman GF/F filters (Whatman, Brentford, UK) and the filtrate was frozen until analysis. Concentrations of TDN and TDP were determined using a persulfate digestion and colorimetric standard methods <ref type="bibr">(Clesceri et al. 1998</ref>) in conjunction with an auto-analyzer (Astoria2 Analyzer, Astoria-Pacific, Clackamas, Oregon, USA). Dissolved organic carbon was analyzed on a Shimadzu TOC 5000 autoanalyzer (Shimadzu Corporation, Kyoto, Japan).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Statistical analysis</head><p>For overall CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations, the two to four replicate samples were averaged for each pond at each sampling round. These biweekly measurements were used to estimate overall means for each gas (n = 89). To evaluate the saturation of each gas relative to the atmosphere, I used the average of monthly air concentrations from April through July for each year from the Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii, USA. The mean CO 2 air concentrations were 398.5 and 400.9 ppm and the mean CH 4 air concentrations were 1.824 and 1.837 ppm for 2013 and 2014, respectively. I then calculated relative saturation between the water and air for both gases in each pond for every sampling date.</p><p>To determine which environmental variables predicted gas concentrations, I created linear mixed- Zmax is depth at the deepest point in the pond effects models with pond as a random effect in R (R Version 3.1.2, R Core Team) using the ''lme4'' package <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bates et al. 2014)</ref>. I evaluated the randomeffects structure by comparing random intercepts for pond, random intercepts for pond with a correlated random slope for time, and random intercepts for pond with an uncorrelated random slope for time. The random intercept for pond was selected because it was most parsimonious and did not differ from the other models. Sampling year was not important in any model and was excluded. Models were constructed using monthly estimates of gas concentrations and environmental variables because TDN, TDP, and DOC were only measured monthly (n = 40). The environmental variables included: temperature, depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and precipitation. Precipitation data was taken from a weather station in Willimantic, Connecticut, USA, about 24 km southwest of the study sites. The precipitation variable is the cumulative amount of precipitation occurring over 2 weeks prior to the sampling date. All environmental variables as well as response variables (CO 2 and CH 4 ) were evaluated for normality and the following variables were natural-log-transformed: CO 2 , CH 4 , DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDN, TDP, and precipitation.</p><p>Models for CO 2 and CH 4 were first fit with all environmental variables and assessed for collinearity by calculating the variation inflation factor (VIF) and removing variables with a VIF C 5. The variables removed included: TDN, TDP, and temperature. As TDN and TDP are highly correlated with DOC (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>) and can be considered proxies for DOC in lentic systems with high terrestrial inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Larsen et al. 2011)</ref>, its removal should not mar model interpretation. Temperature and periphyton chlorophyll a are highly correlated (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>), meaning that if periphyton chlorophyll a is included in top models, it could also be interpreted as a possible temperature effect. Models were then fit with all remaining environmental variables (depth, pH, conductivity, DO, DOC, periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and precipitation). I built models by selectively removing one variable at a time using AICc model selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Burnham and Anderson 2002)</ref>. Once the top predictors were identified, I built the models back up adding in one variable at a time to ensure that I</p><p>Table 3 Pearson correlation coefficients between surface water gas concentrations (CO </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pond characteristics</head><p>The six temporary ponds exhibited high seasonal variability in physical, chemical, and biological parameters (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>). There were seasonal increases in temperature (linear regression, F 1,38 = 145.2, p \ 0.001, R 2 = 0.79), periphyton chlorophyll a (F 1,38 = 31.3, p \ 0.001, R 2 = 0.44), TDN (F 1,38 = 9.2, p = 0.004, R 2 = 0.17), and TDP (F 1,38 = 14.7, p \ 0.001, R 2 = 0.26), and a seasonal decrease in DO (F 1,38 = 20.5, p \ 0.001, R 2 = 0.33). Notably, temperature ranged from 7.1 to 22.2 °C and trophic status ranged from oligotrophic to eutrophic within individual ponds (e.g. phytoplankton chlorophyll a range 0.2-65.1 lg L -1 in Atwood; TDP range 11.4-183.2 lg L -1 in Blacksmith). Dissolved oxygen was undersaturated at all sampling points, ranging from 3.0 to 74.7 %, indicating the ponds were net heterotrophic. There was also substantial between-pond variability (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>), with all of the environmental variables differing among ponds (ANOVA, p \ 0.01) except for DO and temperature. Notably, DOC varied dramatically among ponds with maximum values ranging from 4.9 mg L -1 (Quarry Pond) to 38.4 mg L -1 (Blacksmith Pond).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CO 2 concentrations</head><p>Carbon dioxide concentrations were supersaturated across all ponds and all sampling dates, with an overall mean of 360.6 (±15.2 SE) lmol L -1 (7,716.6 ± 342.7 ppmv), equal to 19.3 (±0.9 SE) fold supersaturation (range 5.7-56.7 fold supersaturation) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Across all ponds and all dates, 75 % of samples were[13-fold saturated and 25 % of samples were [22-fold saturated. The concentrations of CO 2 did not differ with time (linear regression, F 1,87 = 0.24, p = 0.62, R 2 = 0.009), but concentrations did vary by pond (ANOVA, F 5,83 = 12.52, p \ 0.001) with Blacksmith Pond having significantly higher CO 2 concentrations than all other ponds (Tukey HSD, all p \ 0.05), with all other ponds having similar concentrations (Tukey HSD, all p [ 0.05).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>CH 4 concentrations</head><p>Methane concentrations were supersaturated across all ponds and all sampling dates, with an overall mean of 35.7 (±4.1 SE) lmol L -1 (921.7 ± 107.0 ppmv), equal to 504.2 (±58.6 SE) fold supersaturation (range 19.0-2906.6 fold supersaturation) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). Across all ponds and dates, 75 % of samples were [105-fold saturated and 25 % of samples were[755-fold saturated. Methane concentrations had a weak, but significant, positive relationship with time (F 1,87 = 5.40, p = 0.02, R 2 = 0.05) and were similar across all six ponds (ANOVA, F 5,83 = 1.83 p = 0.12). Error bars represent standard error. For reference, the water-air equilibrium was on average 18.99 (±0.29 SE) lmol L -1 for CO 2 and 0.0727 (±0.0008 SE) lmol L -1 for CH 4 across both years Environmental predictors of CO 2 Concentrations of CO 2 negatively correlated with depth and DO, and positively correlated with DOC and TDP (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In the mixed-effects models, DO best predicted CO 2 concentrations, with phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH being of secondary importance (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>). In the top model, DO explained 23 % of the variance, while between-pond variation explained an additional 37 %, highlighting the importance of variation among individual ponds.</p><p>To evaluate the relationship between CO 2 and DO further, I compared CO 2 oversaturation with oxygen (O 2 ) undersaturation using all seasonal data points where CO 2 and O 2 were both measured (n = 78) (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>). There was a significant positive relationship (linear regression, F 1,76 = 13.98, p \ 0.001, R 2 = 0.14), but this relationship began to break down as DO undersaturation increased. In other words, CO 2 saturation was more variable when DO was lower. Furthermore, the majority of the points fell above the one-to-one CO 2 :O 2 ratio expected if CO 2 were only produced by aerobic respiration, indicating substantial anaerobic production of CO 2 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental predictors of CH 4</head><p>Concentrations of CH 4 negatively correlated with DO and precipitation, and positively correlated with temperature and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). In the mixedeffects models, precipitation was the best predictor of CH 4 concentrations, with periphyton chlorophyll a,  phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth being of secondary importance (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). In the top model, precipitation explained 34 % of the variance, while between-pond variation only explained an additional 3 %.</p></div>

(1994)</ref> compared CO 2 concentrations among 1,835 lakes and found that the lower and upper 10 % of samples averaged 3.1fold below and 16-fold above atmospheric equilibrium, respectively (range -175 to 57). In direct comparison, the lower and upper 10 % of samples in this study were 11.2 and 28.6-fold supersaturated.</p><p>Until now, the highest reported CO 2 concentrations came from a study on 64 small (0.0002-0.2 km 2 ), forested ponds in Denmark, where 75 % of the samples were more than 6-fold saturated and 25 % were more than 16-fold saturated (Sand-Jensen and Staehr 2007). High CO 2 concentrations on the order of magnitude reported here have also been seen on the extreme ends of studies evaluating CO 2 in small wetland ponds in the Hudson Bay Lowlands <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hamilton et al. 1994</ref>) and lakes in New England <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Lennon et al. 2006)</ref> and Finland <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Kankaala et al. 2013)</ref>. The temporary ponds studied here had CO 2 concentrations that were consistently some of the highest reported to date, suggesting the conditions in these ponds are prime for CO 2 production.</p><p>There have been fewer studies on CH 4 than CO 2 concentrations in ponds and lakes globally, but comparisons of available data indicate that the CH 4 concentrations in these study ponds were also among the highest reported. The range of CH 4 concentrations reported for ponds and lakes is substantial, with concentrations as low as 0.004 lmol L -1 in an Irish lake <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">(Whitfield et al. 2011</ref>) up to 17.93 lmol L -1 in a Hudson Bay Lowland pond <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hamilton et al. 1994)</ref>. The small wetland ponds found in the Hudson Bay Lowlands have, until now, had the highest reported concentrations of CH 4 : 75 % of ponds were over 38-fold saturated and 25 % of ponds were over 110-fold saturated <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hamilton et al. 1994)</ref>. Collectively, the CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations reported in this Carbon dioxide concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with DO, with phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH of secondary importance. In many lakes, however, CO 2 concentrations are best predicted by a negative relationship with DOC (or TOC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Hope et al. 1996;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jonsson et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Kelly et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Raymond et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roehm et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Sobek et al. 2005)</ref>.

A closer inspection, however, shows most studies that reported DOC as predicting CO 2 did not evaluate the relationship between CO 2 and DO (but see <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roehm et al. 2009</ref>).</p><p>When DO is considered, many studies found a significant negative correlation between CO 2 and DO <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balmer and Downing 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Cole et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kankaala et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kortelainen et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Roulet et al. 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Zhang et al. 2013)</ref>.

A high correlation between O 2 and CO 2 indicates substantial respiration, oftentimes from the sediments <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jonsson et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Kortelainen et al. 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">Roulet et al. 1997</ref>). The relationship between O 2 and CO 2 can be stronger in ponds and lakes with high DOC, likely because of high sedimentation of allochthonous carbon <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Jonsson et al. 2003)</ref>. The ponds studied here are strongly influenced by allochthonous carbon because they are small, with a high perimeter to edge ratio. Each year, the ponds receive between 188 and 253 g m -2 year -1 of dry leaf litter (Holgerson, unpubl. data), providing an annually-renewed source of POC and DOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Meyer et al. 1998)</ref>. Because the ponds are shallow, much of the water is in contact with the sediments where the terrestrial carbon decomposes. Furthermore, sediment respiration can affect the entire water column due to overnight mixing that occurs on the scale of days to weeks <ref type="bibr">(Holgerson, unpubl. data)</ref>.</p><p>The large amount of terrestrial carbon settling at the bottom of the pond is likely responsible for high respiration rates, driving O 2 levels down and CO 2 concentrations up. Substantial anaerobic respiration also occurred in the ponds (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>), supporting the notion that sediment respiration could explain both O 2 and CO 2 concentrations. The importance of sediment respiration in driving CO 2 in small ponds is in contrast to water column DOC driving CO 2 in larger ponds and lakes. This is likely because in larger lakes, allochthonous inputs and the contribution of sediments are lower relative to water volume, and the water column stratifies isolating the effects of the sediments to the hypolimnion. The different conditions between small ponds and larger lakes likely explain why the drivers of surface water CO 2 differ with lake size.</p><p>The second and third top models for predicting CO 2 concentration included phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH, respectively, as covariates of secondary importance to DO. The estimates for both phytoplankton chlorophyll a and pH overlapped with zero, illustrating that these variables are not individually important but do strengthen the relationship between DO and CO 2 . Phytoplankton chlorophyll a negatively correlated with CO 2 , which is intuitive, as increased primary production consumes more CO 2 . Other studies have also seen a negative relationship between CO 2 and phytoplankton <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Balmer and Downing 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Kosten et al. 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Larsen et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roehm et al. 2009)</ref>, highlighting that CO 2 is affected by production in addition to respiration. The third top model included DO and pH, which also negatively correlated with CO 2 . This relationship is most likely driven by increased CO 2 concentrations driving down pH <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Wetzel 2001)</ref>.</p><p>The random effect of pond significantly improved models of CO 2 concentration and increased the best model's R 2 value from 0.23 to 0.60 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ref>), indicating substantial between-pond variation. Blacksmith Pond had the highest CO 2 concentrations while Long and Woodpile Ponds had the lowest. Perhaps geology, groundwater inputs, turbulent differences, or another environmental variable not measured here played a role in between-pond differences. It is worth noting that while groundwater can be an important source of CO 2 in some freshwater systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Humborg et al. 2010)</ref>, there are several indications that groundwater is unlikely to play a major role in these ponds. First, the strong correlation between precipitation and depth (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, r = 0.50) along with low conductivity (\82 lS/cm) indicate that these ponds are fed by precipitation and not groundwater <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Brooks 2004</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Brooks , 2005;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Palik et al. 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Yoshikawa and Hinzman 2003)</ref>. Additionally, there were no spikes in conductivity as the ponds dried, indicating that more water was lost to seepage than to evaporation and that the ponds recharged groundwater rather than drawing from it <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(Schneider and Frost 1996)</ref>. As such, groundwater likely provides minimal CO 2 inputs to these temporary ponds, but there could be variation among sites.</p><p>Year and sampling round had no significant effect on CO 2 , suggesting that CO 2 concentrations in these ponds were similar inter-and intra-annually. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Jonsson et al. (2003)</ref> also found no seasonal effect on CO 2 concentrations across 16 Swedish lakes, hypothesizing that there was little metabolic change and that frequent mixing minimized seasonal changes in CO 2 concentrations. In the ponds studied here, metabolic activity likely increased with temperature as exhibited by seasonal increases in periphyton chlorophyll a. I hypothesize that CO 2 concentrations remained steady due to both polymictic mixing and high sediment respiration throughout the season. It is also possible that anaerobic breakdown of DOC and POC shifted more toward methanogenesis seasonally, which could reduce sediment CO 2 production and mask any seasonal increases in CO 2 that would occur if O 2 were more available.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Environmental predictors of CH 4</head><p>The strongest predictor of CH 4 concentrations in these temporary ponds was precipitation, with periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth being of secondary importance. Increased precipitation was associated with decreased CH 4 concentrations, a contrast with other studies where precipitation increased with CH 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Natchimuthu et al. 2014</ref>) and CO 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Einola et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Roehm et al. 2009</ref>) concentrations or flux. In those studies, increased precipitation was associated with increased DOC in lakes likely due to increased runoff from the landscape <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Einola et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Rantakari and Kortelainen 2005)</ref>. In this study, however, precipitation negatively correlated with DOC (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>, r = -0.45). Precipitation events likely influence small ponds differently than larger lakes because of their particular characteristics. Specifically, the volume of these small and shallow ponds responded dramatically to precipitation events. For instance, 21.7 cm of rainfall occurred during the first 2 weeks of June 2013 and as a result, pond depth increased by an average of 23.5 (±7.7 SE) cm (range 5-50 cm). Most ponds (five of the six) are located in defined basins, which prohibited areal expansion and led to dramatic increases in depth. For instance, Quarry and Long Ponds more than doubled in depth whereas Blacksmith Pond, the only pond able to significantly expand in area, only increased by 5 cm in depth.</p><p>As precipitation dramatically increased depth but not area in five of the six ponds, the relative depth (depth to surface area ratio) increased, causing a dilution effect for many of the pond's biological and chemical parameters. Specifically, increased precipitation correlated with decreased DOC, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, TDP, TDN, and temperature, and increased DO (Table <ref type="table">3</ref>). Many of these effects could alter CH 4 production and concentrations. For instance, DO is negatively correlated with CH 4 concentrations as anoxic sediments or waters are required for methanogenesis <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bastviken et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Juutinen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kankaala et al. 2013)</ref>. Methane concentrations are also affected by lake area and depth: small and shallow lakes have more water in contact with anoxic sediments, less opportunity for methane oxidation between the sediments and surface water, and a well-mixed water column that permits benthic CH 4 to reach the surface <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bastviken et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Juutinen et al. 2009;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kankaala et al. 2013)</ref>. Increased temperature also correlates with greater CH 4 concentrations as methanogenesis increases with temperature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Borrel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Hulzen et al. 1999)</ref>. Interestingly, precipitation led to lower DOC in these ponds, implying an internal source of DOC (e.g. through leaf litter breakdown) that builds up between precipitation events and overmatches any DOC inputs from runoff. Overall, precipitation events dilute the biological and chemical parameters in small ponds, ultimately lowering CH 4 concentrations. In addition to dilution, precipitation also increases gas exchange rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Ho et al. 1997</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Ho et al. , 2000))</ref>, allowing O 2 to enter ponds and increasing efflux of CO 2 and CO 2 . The observed negative relationship between CH 4 concentrations and precipitation was therefore likely a result of both dilution and increased gas exchange.</p><p>Models predicting CH 4 concentrations also suggest that periphyton chlorophyll a, phytoplankton chlorophyll a, and depth were of secondary importance. Periphyton chlorophyll a was not significantly correlated with CH 4 , but did correlate highly with temperature, which was removed from models due to collinearity. As temperature correlated strongly with CH 4 , it is possible that periphyton is acting as a surrogate for temperature in the model, a plausible link as temperature increases methane production <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Borrel et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">van Hulzen et al. 1999)</ref>. Phytoplankton chlorophyll a also positively correlated with CH 4 concentration, likely because phytoplankton biomass increased with temperature and decreased with precipitation. Additionally, algal biomass is very labile and could provide another source of organic matter for decomposition. Lastly, depth improved model predictions, but its estimate included zero. It is likely that the model derived strength from the correlation between depth and precipitation.</p><p>There was little between-pond variation in CH 4 concentrations and as such, the random effect of pond only increased the best model R 2 from 0.34 to 0.37 (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ref>). It is worth considering why between-pond variation was important for CO 2 and not for CH 4 . Methane concentrations were likely driven by precipitation, which was similar across all ponds (and imputed as the same number in models). In contrast, CO 2 concentrations were likely driven by sediment respiration, which was more variable among dates and ponds. Random effects of year and sampling round did also not improve CH 4 models, indicating that concentrations were similar between years and season, with major changes driven by precipitation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Small ponds and inland water carbon budgets</head><p>It is well known that small ponds are more saturated with CO 2 and CH 4 than larger lakes <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bastviken et al. 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Kankaala et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Raymond et al. 2013)</ref>; however, this study shows that these very small ponds (\1000 m 2 ) are among the most saturated reported. Using a gas exchange velocity k 600 of 0.36 m day -1 calculated from a propane-addition study in four similar ponds in the study area (E. Farr, unpubl. data), these ponds emit on average 100.6 (±0.51 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CO 2 and 10.6 (±0.13 SE) mmol C m -2 day -1 from CH 4 . In terms of carbon dioxide equivalence (CO 2 e), the contribution of CH 4 (4.26 g CO 2 e m -2 day -1 ) is comparable to the contribution from CO 2 (4.43 g CO 2 m -2 day -1 ), indicating a similar greenhouse gas potential.
