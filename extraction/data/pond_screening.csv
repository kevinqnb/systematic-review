Here's textual evidence to support this:

*   **Focus on parameters, not definition:** The table (Table 2) lists ecological parameters, demonstrating the study's focus on measuring characteristics *within* the ponds, not defining what constitutes a pond.
*   **Descriptive language:** The text uses terms like 'species-poor “walled” ponds' and 'species-rich ponds' to categorize the study sites based on observed characteristics, rather than providing a formal definition.

For example, the paper mentions 'small lakes and ponds' without providing any measurable characteristics that differentiate a pond from a lake.

Additionally, the text mentions that physico-chemical measurements (conductivity, pH, and oxygen concentration) were taken during winter and summer months using field probes.

*   **Focus on biodiversity and typology:** The paper primarily focuses on classifying ponds based on their biodiversity and ecological characteristics. For example, it mentions ""Ploch: a standardized method for sampling and assessing the biodiversity in ponds"" (Oertli et al., 2005) and discusses the relationship between pond area and biodiversity (Oertli et al., 2002).
