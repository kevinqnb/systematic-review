123,Definition 3: Agricultural Freshwater Pond Supports Diverse and Dynamic Bacterial and Viral Populations,1,True,"According to the text, ponds are generally defined as **small (1 m² to ∼50,000 m²) and shallow, standing water bodies** that can either permanently or temporarily collect freshwater. 

The text does *not* give a specific definition for lakes, only contrasting ponds *as being smaller* than lakes and rivers. It only provides measurable attributes for ponds.
