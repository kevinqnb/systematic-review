0,"Pond 1: Specificity of zooplankton distribution in meteorite craterponds (Morasko, Poland)",pond data,True,False,"Yes, the paper reports data related to physical and chemical attributes of individual ponds. Table II explicitly lists these attributes for each of the four ponds (No. I, II, III, and IV) across different seasons. Examples include temperature, pH, conductivity, DIN (mg·L−1), TP (mg·L−1), Chlorophyll a (mg·m−3), and TSI (Trophic State Index). 

For instance, the excerpt states: 'Table II Descriptive data on zooplankton community structure and physical-chemical parameters in particular seasons and in certain crater. pond No. I I I II ... Temperature 7 19 7 9 19 7 9 20 7 20 (◦C) pH 6.6 6.78 6.8 6.8 7.45 6.6 6.5 7.01 6.3 6.81 Conductivity 173 173 173 761 761 761 338 338 445 445 (µS·cm−1)' This clearly demonstrates the inclusion of physical-chemical parameters for each pond.","[4, 9]"
1,"Pond 1: Specificity of zooplankton distribution in meteorite craterponds (Morasko, Poland)",lake data,False,False,"The paper focuses on data from 'crater ponds,' which are explicitly distinguished from lakes. The table (Table II) presents data for several physical-chemical parameters, but these are associated with the ponds, not lakes. For example, the table lists 'pond No. I, II, III, IV' and provides data for parameters like temperature, pH, conductivity, and DIN for each of these ponds. There is no mention of data related to lakes.","[4, 9]"
2,"Pond 1: Specificity of zooplankton distribution in meteorite craterponds (Morasko, Poland)",pond definition,False,False,"The paper does not provide a specific scientific definition for a pond. While it discusses ponds and compares them to lakes (Søndergaard et al., 2005), it does not offer a definition based on physical or chemical attributes. The paper focuses on analyzing data from specific crater ponds and comparing their characteristics, but it doesn's establish a formal definition of what constitutes a pond.","[9, 4]"
3,Pond 2: Environmental Conditions and Macrophytes of Karst Ponds,pond data,True,False,"Yes, the paper reports data related to physical and chemical attributes of individual ponds. Table 2 provides a detailed listing of ecological parameters for each pond, including morphometric parameters (surface area, depth, volume, surface/depth ratio) and water quality parameters (pH, temperature, conductivity, O2 concentration, O2 saturation, transparency, chlorophyll-a). For example, the text states: 'Pond No. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 surface (m2) 32 177 65 130 79 127 213 28 603 85 745 9 52 35 547 391 255 72 269 64 50 131 98 79 228 51 7 87 depth (m) 0.7 1.5 0.3 1.2 3.3 0.4 0.8 0.2 1.3 0.6 3.0 0.7 0.5 0.4 0.5 0.6 1.0 1.1 0.3 0.2 0.3 0.9 2.6 2.2 1.0 0.9 0.3 1.3 pH 7.2 6.78 6.8 6.8 7.45 6.6 6.5 7.01 6.3 6.81' ","[2, 4]"
4,Pond 2: Environmental Conditions and Macrophytes of Karst Ponds,lake data,False,False,"The provided text consistently refers to 'ponds,' not lakes. While the text describes physical and chemical attributes, these are associated with ponds. There is no mention of lakes or data related to them.","[2, 4]"
5,Pond 2: Environmental Conditions and Macrophytes of Karst Ponds,pond definition,False,False,"The paper does not provide a specific scientific definition for a pond based on physical or chemical attributes. While it discusses ponds extensively, its focus is on biodiversity, environmental factors influencing them, and conservation efforts rather than establishing a formal definition. The text refers to ponds as distinct from lakes (Søndergaard et al., 2005), but doesn't provide measurable criteria to differentiate them. The paper primarily uses 'pond' as a descriptive term for a small body of water, not a scientifically defined entity.","[9, 8]"
