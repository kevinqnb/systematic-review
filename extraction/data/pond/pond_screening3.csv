## Abstract
Inland waters are an important component of the global carbon cycle, but there is a poor understanding of carbon dynamics in very small ponds. In this study, I evaluated the concentrations and drivers of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) in six small (\1000 m 2 ), temporary, forested ponds in Connecticut, USA. The six ponds were on average 19-fold supersaturated in CO 2 and 504-fold supersaturated in CH 4 relative to the atmosphere. For both gases, this level of supersaturation is among the highest reported for lentic freshwaters. The physical, chemical, and biological parameters in the ponds differ from larger lakes, and may explain the supersaturation. Specifically, the ponds have high terrestrial carbon loadings, are shallow, and polymictic, meaning much of the water is in contact with the carbon-rich sediments. Pond CO 2 concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with dissolved oxygen (DO), indicating that substantial respiration, likely from the sediments, drew down oxygen (O 2 ) and produced CO 2 . The stoichiometric relationship between CO 2 supersaturation and O 2 undersaturation also implicates anaerobic respiration as a significant source of CO 2 production in the ponds. The high carbon, low oxygen, and shallow nature of small ponds were also prime for CH 4 supersaturation. Methane concentrations were best predicted by a negative relationship with precipitation, likely because precipitation increased pond depth, diluted dissolved organic carbon and gas concentrations, and increased DO. If the respiration of terrestrial carbon in small ponds is not accounted for in carbon budgets, current estimates of terrestrial net ecosystem productivity may be overestimated.",False,False

Inland waters play an important role in the global carbon cycle. While estimated to comprise only 2.2-3.7 % of the earth's non-glaciated land area (Raymond et al. 2013;Verpoorter et al. 2014), inland waters process the same amount of carbon as both net terrestrial productivity and net oceanic uptake (Aufdenkampe et al. 2011;Battin et al. 2009). Yet, estimates of global carbon flux from inland waters are ridden with uncertainty (Raymond et al. 2013) and finer-scale studies are needed to determine carbon concentrations in global waters (Battin et al. 2009).One source of uncertainty in global carbon budgets is the role of small ponds. The majority of studies on carbon cycling in lentic systems have focused on medium-to large-sized lakes. Yet the vast majority of ponds and lakes are small: over 90 % of all ponds and lakes are\0.01 km 2 (Downing et al. 2006;Verpoorter et al. 2014), not including very small ponds (0.0001-0.001 km 2 ) which could number as high as 3.2 billion and cover 0.8 million km 2 of surface area (Downing 2010). However, small ponds\0.1 km 2 are difficult to map (Lehner and Do Â¨ll 2004) and even highresolution satellite images cannot accurately identify ponds\0.002 km 2 (Verpoorter et al. 2014). Due to the uncertainty of their distribution, very small ponds (\0.001 km 2 ) remain difficult to assess in regional and global biogeochemical models, and are excluded.",False,False
3,ponds3,2,True,"Regardless of their areal extent, small ponds may be hotspots for carbon cycling. Small and shallow ponds receive high loadings of terrestrial dissolved and particulate organic carbon (DOC, POC) relative to their water volume, which increases respiration and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) production (Hope et al. 1996;Kelly et al. 2001;Kortelainen et al. 2006;Rubbo et al. 2006). Methane (CH 4 ) concentrations also tend to be greater in small ponds because more water is in contact with anoxic sediments and shallow waters reduce the amount of CH 4 oxidation that occurs between the sediments and surface waters (Bastviken et al. 2004;Juutinen et al. 2009;Kankaala et al. 2013). As CH 4 has a global warming potential about 25 times higher than CO 2 , its contribution to carbon budgets should not be overlooked (Bastviken et al. 2011).Although small, shallow ponds are abundant and may be highly saturated with carbon gases, few studies have evaluated the concentrations, fluxes, and drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 in very small ponds. The studies that have done so indicate that small ponds (B0.01 km 2 ) have some of the highest CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations in both boreal and temperate regions (Table 1). Due to their high concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 , is possible that carbon flux from small ponds \0.01 km 2 may match that of larger lakes on both a local (Abnizova et al. 2012) and a global (Torgersen and Branco 2008) scale.",False,True
4,ponds3,3,True,"Yet the paucity of studies on carbon dynamics in small ponds, particularly in temperate regions, limits our understanding of inland water carbon cycling. It is imperative to know both the concentrations and mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 supersaturation in small freshwaters. As very small ponds have unique chemical, physical, and biological parameters, the drivers of carbon concentrations may differ from larger lakes. For instance, high carbon loading, shallow waters, and frequent mixing could lead to different mechanisms driving CO 2 and CH 4 production in small ponds compared to larger lakes. Furthermore, small pond carbon dynamics may be more sensitive than larger lakes to seasonal and annual variation, such as temperature changes and water availability. Carbon cycling provides valuable knowledge on pond and lake biology, which is important considering the vast majority of the world's ponds and lakes are very small. Additionally, understanding the drivers and concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small ponds will inform local, regional, and global carbon budgets.This study examines the carbon dynamics of six very small (\0.001 km 2 ), temporary ponds in Connecticut, USA across the open water season and across two years. The goals of the study were (1) to quantify the concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 in small, temporary, and temperate ponds and (2) to identify the local drivers of CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations.",False,False

## Study sites and sampling
I sampled six temporary ponds in 2013 and five of the six in 2014 (Long Pond was removed from study in 2014 for a whole-ecosystem experiment) (Table 2). The study ponds are located within the Yale Myers Forest, a 3,213-ha research forest in Tolland and Windham Counties, Connecticut, USA. The ponds are located in mixed deciduous-coniferous forest with minimal human disturbance. The forest composition surrounding the six ponds is primarily oak (Quercus rubra, Q. alba), red maple (Acer rubrum), Eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis), and pine (Pinus resinosa, P. strobus). The soil types are Charlton-Chatfield Complex (Blacksmith, E8, Quarry, Woodpile Ponds) and Hinckley gravelly sandy loam (Long, Atwood Ponds), with slopes ranging from 3 to 15 %, except for E8 Pond where surrounding slopes range from 15 to 45 % (U.S. Department of Agriculture NRCS 1996). Temporary ponds like these are abundant throughout northern and eastern North America, with one to thirteen ponds per km 2 of undeveloped forest (Brooks et al. 1998;Capps et al. 2014;Palik et al. 2003;Wu et al. 2014). In this region, ponds typically fill with autumnal rains, freeze over the winter, thaw in early spring, and dry by late summer or early fall, although hydroperiod is sensitive to precipitation events. Five of the six study ponds dried in 2013 (all but Woodpile Pond) and all ponds dried in 2014. All six ponds are shallow (\1 m), lack inlets and outlets, and have little emergent vegetation.",False,False
6,ponds3,5,True,"I sampled ponds for CO 2 and CH 4 concentrations biweekly from after ice-out in April until the ponds began to dry mid-to late-July. Dry date differed by ponds and among years, allowing up to 9 sampling rounds for each pond in 2013 and up to eight sampling rounds in 2014. In addition to gas concentrations, I measured depth, water temperature, percent dissolved oxygen (DO) (ProODO, Yellow Springs Instruments, Yellow Springs, Ohio, USA), pH, and conductivity (Waterproof Multiparameter PCS Testr 35, Oakton Instruments, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA) biweekly. I also took biweekly samples for chlorophyll a from periphyton growing attached to glass slides (Periphyton Sampler, Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) and from surface water for phytoplankton. Once per month I took water samples to measure total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Samples were taken from surface waters near Z max . For gas concentrations, I took two samples at Z max and in all but the smallest pond (Quarry Pond), I took two additional samples at either end of the pond to account for spatial variability.",False,False
7,ponds3,6,True,"## Gas concentrations
Water samples were collected from 5 to 10 cm below the surface of the water using a peristaltic pump (Masterflex E/S Portable Sampler, Cole-Parmer, Vernon Hills, Illinois, USA). I collected water in glass BOD bottles, flushed at least twice by their volume while ensuring that no bubbles were produced. I then extracted 110 mL of water using a 140-mL plastic syringe with a three-way stopcock, also being careful to not produce bubbles. I immediately added 30 mL of N 2 , and shook the syringe vigorously for two 2 min to ensure gas equilibrium. I then extracted 15 mL of headspace and stored it in a 12-mL evacuated vial (839 W Exetainer, Labco Limited, Lampeter, UK) until analysis.Headspace concentrations of CO 2 and CH 4 were measured by gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector fit with a methanizer (Shimadzu GC2014, Kyoto, Japan) and calculated using standard curves. Concentrations of gases dissolved in water were corrected for dilution and calculated according to Henry's law using values for CO 2 from Weiss (1974) and for CH 4 from Wiesenburg and Guinasso (1979).",False,False
