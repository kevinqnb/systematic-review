## Abstract
Detection of the effects of climate change on ocean ecosystems is often limited by the short duration of available time series. Here, we use ocean transparency measurements (the Secchi disk depth, Z SD ) in the California Current Ecosystem since 1949 and combine them with satellite estimates. Historic in situ measurements of Z SD were irregular in space and time and are difficult to interpret in time series due to biases introduced by changing locations and timing. We normalize historic Z SD measurements with satellite-derived mean climatology and create a merged in situ-satellite time series of Z SD for the last $ 73 yr. Although interannual variability in Z SD is dominated by El Niño Southern Oscillation-related variability ($ 50% of the total variance in many areas), a secular trend of decreasing transparency that is correlated with increasing productivity is detected 0-300 km from the coast in an area affected by coastal upwelling north of 27 N. In contrast, increasing transparency (correlated with decreasing productivity) is detected offshore (> 1000 km from the coast). In addition to those general trends, transparency is also increasing in coastal area off Baja California south of 27 N.",False,False,False,

Oceanic phytoplankton play an important role in the global carbon budget and any changes in their productivity and composition are therefore of special interest for global climate change and biogeochemical cycling (Behrenfeld et al. 2016;Falkowski et al. 2008). A claim by Boyce et al. (2010Boyce et al. ( , 2012Boyce et al. ( , 2014) that global phytoplankton biomass has drastically declined over the last 100 yr has been challenged (McQuatters-Gollop et al. 2011 and others) and is affected by uncertainties in the available data. Climate-driven trends in global phytoplankton are typically evaluated using satellite data but these time series are relatively short and open to different interpretation (Behrenfeld et al. 2006(Behrenfeld et al. , 2016;;Martinez et al. 2009). Longer time series can be estimated using geochemical methods (Osman et al. 2019) or numerical models (Dutkiewicz et al. 2019;Cael et al. 2021).",False,False,False,
10,10.1002/lno.12365,2,True,"Water transparency is an integrative variable that includes the effects of absorption by a wide variety of dissolved substances as well the effects of absorption and scattering by phytoplankton and non-algal particles (Preisendorfer 1986). Water transparency affects processes such as primary production, solar bleaching of organic material, and phytoplankton physiology (Kirk 1994), as well as the encounter rates of zooplankton with fish (Aksnes and Giske 1993; Aksnes and Utne 1997) and zooplankton diel vertical migration behavior (Ohman and Romagnan 2016). Also, the other way round, processes like primary productivity and bleaching affect transparency. Water transparency can be measured with optical instruments and estimated with satellite sensors but a simple method called the Secchi disk depth (Z SD , m) using the depth of disappearance of a white disk has been used for over a century (Tyler 1968;Preisendorfer 1986;Aksnes and Ohman 2009;Boyce et al. 2010;Pitarch 2020;Pitarch et al. 2021). Although the Secchi disk depth is a rather simple measurement, its advantage is the large number of measurements extending back many decades. Aksnes and Ohman (2009) documented a decrease in Z SD in the nearshore region of the southern California Current Ecosystem (CCE) over the period 1969-2007. However, the variability was too large to detect any Z SD trends offshore.",False,False,False,
11,10.1002/lno.12365,3,True,"In oceanic waters, water transparency is closely correlated with phytoplankton concentration (typically measured as chlorophyll a [Chl a]; Falkowski and Wilson 1992) but is also sporadically reduced by river outflow plumes, other inputs of dissolved organic matter, and by resuspension of inorganic particles near the coast. Events such as phytoplankton blooms can markedly reduce Z SD . All these events typically last from days to weeks. In contrast, on longer time scales, interannual variability due to perturbations such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and anomalous heatwaves (e.g., ""the Blob,"" Bond et al. 2015) have strong effects on the whole marine ecosystem (Kahru and Mitchell 2000;Kahru et al. 2012Kahru et al. , 2018;;Jacox et al. 2018;Lilly et al. 2019) and can make it challenging to assess whether long-term secular changes have occurred in an ocean region. In the Baltic Sea, Dupont and Aksnes (2013) fitted an empirical relationship between Z SD and the distance to coast and bottom depth to remove the mean effect of those two variables. However, such effects are not uniform in space and time. Kahru et al. (2022) removed both the mean spatial and seasonal variability in Z SD using satellite-derived Z SD climatology to further investigate centennial trends in the Baltic.Here, we adopt the same approach as Kahru et al. (2022) and normalize historic shipborne Z SD measurements by subtracting the mean 10-d seasonal Z SD value of the nearest 4.5-km satellite pixel from each Z SD measurement. We then compare in situ and satellite time series and merge them, in order to reconstruct a seven-decade record of water transparency in the CCE. The goal of this paper is to evaluate interannual variability and test for possible secular trends in water transparency in the CCE, using it as a proxy for primary productivity.",False,False,False,

## Satellite data
A number of models exist for calculating Z SD from optical data (Preisendorfer 1986), but most are empirical in nature (Prasad et al. 1998) and less reliable in variable conditions. The algorithm of Lee et al. (2015), on the other hand, is based on new theoretical interpretation of sighting a Secchi disk in water, which adapts to the change in the spectral composition of subsurface light. The algorithm and the model have been validated in different locations with different sensors (Lee et al. 2015(Lee et al. , 2018;;Liu et al. 2019;Kahru et al. 2022;Brewin et al. 2023).The primary source of satellite data used here was the ESA Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative (OC-CCI) version 5.0 (Sathyendranath et al. 2019, https://esa-oceancolour-cci.org/). OC-CCI data were available from September 1997 to the end of 2021 and are merged from multiple ocean color sensors: SeaWiFS (1997)(1998)(1999)(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010), MERIS (2002MERIS ( -2012)), MODIS-Aqua (2002-2021), VIIRS-SNPP (2012-2021), and OLCI-A (2017-2021). We applied the Lee et al. (2015) Z SD algorithm to OC-CCI daily remote sensing reflectance (R rs ) datasets of the six spectral bands (412,443,490,510,560, and 665 nm) at 4.5 km spatial resolution. We also used the diffuse attenuation coefficient at 490 nm (Kd 490 , m À1 ) derived following Lee et al. (2013), which is another common measure of water transparency (Preisendorfer 1986).",False,False,False,

As inputs, we used daily OC-CCI Chl a (mg m À3 ), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, merged from multiple sensors processed by NASA OBPG) and optimally interpolated daily sea-surface temperature (Reynolds et al. 2007). NPP was also estimated using the more recent CAFE model (Silsbe et al. 2016). Monthly CAFE model NPP products based on SeaWiFS and MODISA data were downloaded from http://sites.science.oregonstate.edu/ocean.  productivity/index.php and merged.Monthly anomalies of Z SD and Kd 490 were calculated for each pixel by removing the climatological monthly mean pixel value.

Aksnes and Ohman (2009) assembled in situ Z SD data in the California Current region for 1949-2007. Most of these data were from the CalCOFI cruises conducted approximately quarterly (Ohman and Venrick 2003). We added additional measurements from the Southern California Bight Study (SCBS, 1975-1987, Eppley et al. 1985) and from recent CalCOFI cruises (https://  calcofi.org/) until cruise 2021/11. Early Z SD measurements (until 1969) were made with different methods (including with artificial lighting at night and a disk with black and white quadrants by day) and these were transformed and standardized by Aksnes and Ohman (2009). The total number of in situ Z SD measurements assembled was 6557 for the time period 1949-2021 (Table 1). The locations of those in situ measurements changed over time (Fig. 1), with more extensive coverage in earlier decades. During the period of satellite data availability (beginning September 1998), the areal coverage of in situ data was more limited (Fig. 2A). We refer to that area as the main study area (MSA).In situ Z SD measurements were converted to Z SD anomalies by subtracting the satellite-derived mean Z SD value

Anomalies of in situ Z SD were created by subtracting the respective climatology value of the nearest pixel in space and the 10-d period corresponding to the date of the measurement. This normalization of the numerous but spatially and temporally irregular historic samples made measurements in different areas (with different means) more comparable. The same procedure was applied to satellite data by subtracting the climatology value from the 10-d Z SD and Kd 490 composites.

The SDSLA timeseries consists of monthly average sea-level anomalies, from which the seasonal cycle and long-term trend were removed, and, while correlated with equatorial indices of ENSO, is a more appropriate index of ENSO expression in this mid-latitude region (Lilly and Ohman 2018).Potential trends in time series and their statistical significance were evaluated using the nonparametric Sen slope estimator (Sen 1968;Gilbert 1987) with the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test to evaluate the statistical significance of the trend (Salmi et al. 2002).",False,False,False,

## Validation of satellite estimates
The Lee et al. (2015) Z SD model has been applied in a number of regions (Shang et al. 2016;Liu et al. 2020a,b;Kahru et al. 2022;Brewin et al. 2023). We validated the satellitederived Z SD datasets at daily and 4.5-km resolutions. We found a total of 443 same-day matchups with in situ measurements and used the average pixel value in a 3 Â 3 pixel window centered at the in situ measurement. Match-ups with high pixelto-pixel variability ([Max À Min]/Min > 0.5) and with less than five valid pixels out of nine were excluded. The relationship between in situ and satellite Z SD was evaluated using both the ordinary least squares linear regression and a Type II reduced major axis linear regression (York et al. 2004). We detected no significant bias between satellite and in situ data until Z SD of about 30 m. At in situ Z SD > 30 m, satellite-derived values underestimated the in situ values. To match satellite data product with in situ measurements for those deep Z SD waters, we applied an empirical conversion by fitting a power function (Y = 1.59 Â X 0.82 , where Y is satellite-derived Z SD and X is in situ Z SD ) and then inverting it. We applied the conversion only for Z SD > 15 m. The modified algorithm performed well (r 2 = 0.77, Fig. 2B) with a mean absolute percent difference $ 15% and median absolute percent difference $ 11%. Some of the scatter around the curve is expected to be due to the difference in scale between an in situ point measurement and the mean of a 3 Â 3 pixel area. The discrepancy at the clearest waters may be caused by problems with satellite estimates of R rs as the Lee et al. (2015) algorithm has been shown to work well also in clear waters when using in situ R rs data (Brewin et al. 2023). In conclusion, we assume that our converted satellite estimates of Z SD are reasonably accurate and representative of in situ Secchi depth measurements.",False,False,False,
18,10.1002/lno.12365,10,True,"## Time series of Z SD anomaly in the MSA
The MSA (Figs. 2A) was spatially well covered by both in situ and satellite measurements but the temporal coverage of the in situ data was restricted to approximately four cruises per year. The less frequent temporal coverage and the spatially less dense sampling probably explain why the monthly means of in situ Z SD were more variable than the satellite-derived monthly means (Fig. 3A vs. Fig. 3B). However, the annual means of the in situ and satellite time series (Fig. 3C) were in good agreement (r 2 = 0.78, p < 0.001). The annual in situ Z SD anomalies were slightly more variable than the satellitederived annual averages. Interestingly, the biggest discrepancy between the satellite and in situ values was during the 2014-2015 warm anomaly when the in situ Z SD values were higher than the satellite-derived values. Satellite-derived Kd 490 (Fig. 3D) behaved like an inverse of the satellite-derived Z SD with high correlation (r 2 = 0.80, p < 0.001). The minor differences may be due to the fact that Z SD is based on the most transparent band that is not necessarily the 490-nm band. The most transparent spectral band in the CCE is typically the 443-nm band for offshore waters that switches to longer wavelengths in coastal waters. Annual anomalies in Z SD are negatively correlated with anomalies of Chl a (Fig. 3E, r 2 = 0.98, p < 0.001) and NPP estimated with VGPM-CAL (r 2 = 0.96, p < 0.001) and CAFE (r 2 = 0.75, p < 0.001). It is notable that the coefficient of determination (r 2 ) is highest with Chl a, followed by VGPM-CAL, Kd 490 , and CAFE.",False,False,False,

During the period of satellite data (1997-2021; Fig. 3B) the linear decreasing trend of monthly satellite-derived Z SD anomaly in MSA was significant at p < 0.05 but not at p < 0.01.

20,10.1002/lno.12365,12,True,"## Time series of Z SD anomaly in 1 Â 1 spatial bins
As temporal trends in Z SD can be either positive or negative dependent on location, the trend estimates averaged over large areas, such as MSA, may be misleading. Although satellite time series can be evaluated at high spatial resolution, in situ are spatially sparse. We therefore used 1 Â 1 spatial bins to evaluate trends in Z SD time series. Due to the spatially and temporally irregular sampling pattern, particularly in the early decades, the start year and the total number of years with Z SD data were variable (Fig. 6). In most bins the measurements started around year 1950 (Fig. 6A) but were followed by a long gap (1952)(1953)(1954)(1955)(1956)(1957)(1958)(1959)(1960)(1961)(1962)(1963)(1964)(1965)(1966)(1967)(1968); Table 1; Fig. 4). We considered bins with at least 26 yr of Z SD data (i.e., 25 yr of satellite data and at least an additional 1 yr of in situ data). Most bins had at least 30 yr of data and the bins off southern California had 40-53 yr of data (Fig. 6b).As Z SD anomalies are correlated with the ENSO cycle in this region (Fig. 5), the time series be biased by sampling during a particular phase of the ENSO cycle. This was particularly relevant during the early period when the number of sampled years was small and sampling was not annual. We therefore removed the average effect of ENSO in each 1 Â 1 spatial bin by subtracting the expected Z SD value estimated from the ENSO index. We constructed linear regression models between an ENSO index (both MEI and SDSLA) and monthly Z SD for each 1 Â 1 bin (like Fig. 5A) using satellite data of 1997-2021. We then removed the mean ENSO effect by subtracting the predicted monthly Z SD value estimated from the monthly SDSLA index. The corrected monthly Z SD values were then averaged annually.",False,False,False,

The ENSO correction removed some of the scatter and improved the detection of change. The bins with decreasing Z SD were primarily in coastal upwelling-affected areas along the coast of California and the bins with increasing Z SD were in a limited region off southern Baja California. In the majority of bins, the trend estimated as the Sen slope was not significant. The Sen slope is estimated as the median of all possible slope estimates. Therefore, for bins with 25 yr of satellite data and only a few years of in situ data the Sen slope can be significant only if the trend is also present during the satellite period. In offshore areas with only a few years of presatellite measurements, the Sen slope would not detect a significant change even if there was a big jump between the early period  and the satellite-period.

In contrast to the changes detected by the Sen slope, a number of offshore bins showed increasing Z SD . That was not evident in the Sen slope pattern due to the relatively small number of annual values during the presatellite period. This shows that oceanic offshore waters have probably experienced a shift to increased Z SD from $ 1950 to present but the change is statistically difficult to prove due to the availability of only a few annual values from the presatellite period. The trend of increasing transparency in offshore waters becomes apparent when the change in Z SD from the presatellite period to the present (1998-2021) is pooled for three regions based on distance from the coast (Fig. 8).

Water transparency is an important habitat characteristic for all aquatic organisms that are affected by light (Kirk 1994;Dupont and Aksnes 2013). In addition to in situ measurements, water transparency can be estimated with satellite ocean color data (Lee et al. 2015) with the advantage of consistent large-scale coverage at frequent intervals. High sampling frequency is essential to discover trends in areas of high variability. For example, around the Channel Islands in the  Southern California Bight where transparency is highly variable and affected by both plumes of sediment-rich turbid waters and blooms of phytoplankton (Otero and Siegel 2004), trends were difficult to detect in spite of over 50 yr of measurements.In oceanic waters transparency is highly correlated with phytoplankton biomass (Chl a) and primary productivity (Fig. 3E). As transparency measurements are robust and much easier to make than in situ measurements of primary productivity, transparency can be used as a proxy to estimate trends in primary productivity. The high correlation among Chl a, Z SD , NPP, and other satellite-derived variables is artificially increased when using satellite-derived estimates. All these products are derived from remote sensing reflectances that are inter-correlated and have few degrees of freedom (Cael et al. 2023). With these caveats in mind, it is not surprising that Z SD may be better correlated with a model of primary production than different models of primary production using different input data with each other.",False,False,False,
24,10.1002/lno.12365,16,True,"The trend of decreasing water transparency in the California Current coastal waters was first shown by Aksnes and Ohman (2009) who estimated a reduction in the Secchi depth by 0.06-0.13 m yr À1 in the nearshore region of the southern California Current over the period 1969-2007. Our merged time series confirm the general decrease in transparency in the upwelling-affected coastal areas but also show a spatially complex pattern with areas of increasing transparency and areas of decreasing transparency. Decreasing transparency (increasing productivity) is evident in most upwelling-affected areas along the coast of California excluding a limited area off Southern Baja California. Offshore oceanic waters, on the contrary, have increased transparency (decreased productivity) when comparing the pre-satellite ($ 1950-1997) period with the modern (1998-2021) period. Due to the small number of measurements in the presatellite era, the statistical significance of that change can be problematic to prove.Interannual variability associated with ENSO has a strong effect on water transparency and primary productivity and explains $ 50% of the total Z SD variability in many locations. Although the long-term trends in water transparency and productivity are relatively small compared to their interannual variability, they are likely to have significant long-term effects on the ecosystem in the California Current area. This underscores the importance of sustaining long records in order for underlying trends to emerge from background variability (Hameau et al. 2019).Our results support the conclusions drawn from multiple previous studies that the effect of global climate change and warming of the upper ocean is leading to decrease of productivity in ocean gyres (Polovina et al. 2008;Kahru et al. 2009Kahru et al. , 2012;;Boyce et al. 2010Boyce et al. , 2014;;Behrenfeld et al. 2016;Osman et al. 2019;Meng et al. 2021;Leonelli et al. 2022) but increase in productivity in coastal zones (Kahru et al. 2009(Kahru et al. , 2012)).",False,False,False,

Time series of historic shipboard measurements of water transparency combined with modern satellite data show a long-term trend of decreasing transparency (increasing productivity) in the upwelling ecosystem of the California Current during 1949-2021 but an increasing transparency (decreasing productivity) in offshore waters. Although the secular changes are relatively small compared to the ENSO-type interannual variability, their long-term effects are likely to be significant on the functioning of the ecosystem.### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1.

## Abstract
Radium isotopes and radon are routinely used as tracers to quantify groundwater and porewater fluxes into coastal and freshwater systems. However, uncertainties associated with the determination of the tracer flux are often poorly addressed and often neglect all the potential errors associated with the conceptualization of the system (i.e., conceptual uncertainties). In this study, we assess the magnitude of some of the key uncertainties related to the determination of the radium and radon inputs supplied by groundwater and porewater fluxes into a waterbody (La Palme Lagoon, France). This uncertainty assessment is addressed through a single model ensemble approach, where a tracer mass balance is run multiple times with variable sets of assumptions and approaches for the key parameters determined through a sensitivity test. In particular, conceptual uncertainties linked to tracer concentration, diffusive fluxes, radon evasion to the atmosphere, and change of tracer inventory over time were considered. The magnitude of porewater fluxes is further constrained using a comparison of independent methods: (1) 224 Ra and (2) 222 Rn mass balances in overlying waters, (3) a model of 222 Rn deficit in sediments, and (4) a fluid-salt numerical transport model. We demonstrate that conceptual uncertainties are commonly a major source of uncertainty on the estimation of groundwater or porewater fluxes and they need to be taken into account when using tracer mass balances. In the absence of a general framework for assessing these uncertainties, this study provides a practical approach to evaluate key uncertainties associated to radon and radium mass balances.",False,False,False,

Groundwater and porewater fluxes into the coastal zone are recognized as important contributors to the hydrological and biogeochemical budgets of coastal and freshwater systems (Moore et al. 2008;Rodellas et al. 2015a;Cho et al. 2018). Among the different methods for quantifying groundwater and porewater fluxes (e.g., seepage meters, hydrogeologic modeling, environmental or artificial tracers), naturally occurring radionuclides are today the most widely applied tool, particularly radium isotopes and radon (Taniguchi et al. 2019). Radium isotopes and radon are produced by the decay of their parent isotopes within the geological matrix. Their concentrations within the subsurface are therefore significantly enriched with respect to coastal surface waters, producing a substantial net tracer flux to surface waters as a consequence of groundwater and porewater discharge. Radium isotopes and radon are also conservative in seawater and their half-lives (e.g., 3.6 d for 224 Ra and 3.8 d for 222 Rn) are well suited to the common timescales of coastal processes (Burnett et al. 2001;Moore 2010). For the purpose of this study, the term ""porewater fluxes"" is used to include all of the advective water inputs occurring across the sediment-water interface, regardless of the driving force and the spatial scale of the process. This process is also often referred to as Submarine Groundwater Discharge (SGD), but we prefer not using this term to not exclude studies in freshwater systems (e.g., lakes, rivers).",False,False,False,
33,10.1002/lno.11678,2,True,"The most common approach for assessing porewater fluxes involves mass balances, which integrate the inflows and outflows from various pathways and thus smooth out spatial heterogeneities (Charette et al. 2008). The tracer flux supplied by porewater can be estimated by measuring the tracer concentration in the studied system and accounting for all the other potential tracer sources (e.g., diffusion from sediments, sediment resuspension, riverine inputs) and sinks (e.g., radioactive decay, export offshore, evasion to the atmosphere). This tracer flux is then converted to a porewater flux by dividing the tracer flux by the tracer concentration in the discharging fluids (i.e., the porewater endmember) (Charette et al. 2008;Cook et al. 2018b).",False,False,False,
34,10.1002/lno.11678,3,True,"The characterization of both the tracer flux and the endmember tracer concentration are thus critical components of tracer-derived estimates of porewater fluxes.

Indeed, most of the uncertainty assessments attribute all sources of uncertainty to analytical errors or spatial and temporal variability of model parameters (e.g., tracer concentration, wind speed, water volume) (e.g., Alorda-Kleinglass et al. 2019;Webb et al. 2019). However, as an abstract representation of natural systems and processes, the conceptualization of a model in itself is a considerable source of uncertainty, the so called conceptual uncertainty (Enemark et al. 2019). In the case of radon and radium mass balances, these conceptual uncertainties are often linked to (1) intrinsic assumptions of the model used (e.g., the system is at steady state, all the outputs occur at an average concentration) or (2) the choice of the equation/method used to quantify the source and sink terms (e.g., multiple possible approaches to determine diffusive fluxes or mixing losses, several winddependent empirical equations to estimate radon evasion to the atmosphere). Whereas these conceptual uncertainties are sometimes acknowledged as the main source of uncertainty on tracer flux estimates, they are rarely considered in the quantitative uncertainty assessment. Neglecting conceptual uncertainties may introduce a significant bias to the mass balance results and lead to overconfidence in mass balancederived flux estimates.",False,False,False,

We estimate the most relevant parameters of the tracer mass balance by combining multiple approaches and varying assumptions and we evaluate their influence on porewater flux estimates. We further constrain the magnitude of porewater flux estimates and their uncertainties by a multimodel approach that compares four independent approaches: (1) 224 Ra and (2) 222 Rn mass balances in overlying waters, (3) a model of 222 Rn deficit in sediments, and (4) a fluid-salt numerical transport model.",False,False,False,

Study site: La Palme Lagoon, France La Palme Lagoon (NW Mediterranean, France) (Fig. 1) is a small (500 ha surface area), shallow coastal lagoon, with mean and maximum water depths of $ 0.7 m and $ 2 m, respectively and is unaffected by tidal forcing. Most of the lagoon is covered by fine-to-coarse grained sands (100-500 μm) except the northern part of the northern basin that is dominated by fine-grained sediments ($ 50 μm). This study focused on the northern basin of the lagoon, which has restricted flushing from the southern basin due to dikes and represents the main waterbody ($ 85% of the lagoon area and > 95% of the total water volume; Stieglitz et al. 2013). This limited exchange, together with high evaporation rates in summer, often leads to hyper-saline conditions in the lagoon (> 60; Rodellas et al. 2018).La Palme Lagoon receives continuous brackish groundwater inputs from a regional karst aquifer (3× 10 3 to 25 × 10 3 m 3 d -1 ; Stieglitz et al. 2013;Bejannin et al. 2017;Rodellas et al. 2018), chiefly from a karstic spring connected to the lagoon via a small stream in the northwestern part of the lagoon (Wilke and Boutière 2000;Monnin et al. 2019). For the purpose of this study, the input of low-salinity groundwater through this spring-fed stream is treated as a surficial input and thus it is not included within porewater fluxes. Some small ephemeral streams also supply freshwater to the lagoon, but they cease to flow soon after rainfall events and are typically inactive during summer months (the period of this study).",False,False,False,

Estimated porewater fluxes vary seasonally and range from 20 × 10 3 to 90 × 10 3 m 3 d -1 , largely depending on their temporally variable driving forces, chiefly lagoon water levels and locally generated wind waves (Cook et al. 2018a;Rodellas et al. 2020).",False,False,False,

Most of the radon and radium data used in the mass balance is derived from two previous studies that were conducted concurrently in La Palme Lagoon in June 2016 (Rodellas et al. 2018 for 222 Rn and Tamborski et al. 2018 for  224 Ra) (Fig. 1). This data include 222 Rn and 224 Ra concentrations in (1) lagoon surface waters, (2) pore waters collected at four different locations (Pz1, Pz2, Pz3, and Pz4) and at different depths (from 5 to 50 cm below the sediment-water interface), and (3) discrete water samples from the permanent stream that flows into the lagoon and is fed by the main karstic groundwater spring (Fig. 1).

Identified sources and sinks of 222 Rn and 224 Ra for the northern section of La Palme Lagoon are shown in Fig. 2.

An initial estimate of the fluxes in the mass balance is needed to subsequently assess the sensitivity of porewater flux estimates to different mass balance parameters.

The different parameters in Eqs. 1.1, 1.2 are determined using previously estimated values or applying common approaches in groundwater/porewater studies. Values of V, A, Q out , C Ra , X sed , and C susp for 222 Rn and 224 Ra are obtained directly from Rodellas et al. (2018) and Tamborski et al. (2018) (Table 1). The main surface inputs to the lagoon (Q str ) occurred via the spring-fed stream, which was directly measured by Tamborski et al. (2018) with a flow meter in the 2016 dry season. The tracer concentration in the karstic spring is used as C str , assuming that there were no major tracer losses (radioactive decay and evasion to the atmosphere) or   224 Ra concentration in the lagoon in June 2016 (Rodellas et al. 2018;Tamborski et al. 2018).

The diffusive fluxes of 222 Rn and 224 Ra from lagoon sediments are obtained directly from Rodellas et al. (2018) and Tamborski et al. (2018), who used experimental approaches frequently applied in the literature: 222 Rn diffusive fluxes were estimated from a depth-independent approach based on the radon concentration in equilibrium with sediments and 224 Ra diffusive fluxes were estimated from sediment incubations.

As a first approximation of the uncertainties of F PW , we propagate parameter uncertainties derived from analytical uncertainties, standard errors of the mean or from the literature.

We conducted a sensitivity analysis to determine the parameters to which the mass balance is most sensitive to.

Because lagoon water volume (V) is related to lagoon area (V = AÁh, where h is the water depth), we evaluated the sensitivity of porewater fluxes to h rather than to V. Given that the initial estimation of ∂CV ∂t was 0 (steady state), a daily change in tracer concentrations of ± 5% is attributed to this parameter. The key model parameters determined from the sensitivity analysis are subsequently quantified using different approaches that are commonly applied in the literature to determine their potential variability.To assess the uncertainties associated to porewater fluxes estimated from 222 Rn and 224 Ra mass balances (F PW ), we applied a single model ensemble: a unique model (the tracer mass balance in Eqs. 1.1, 1.2) is run multiple times with the different quantifications of the key model parameters (previously determined in the sensitivity analysis). We conducted a Monte Carlo analysis using 10,000 stochastic simulations for each tracer ( 222 Rn and 224 Ra) where different parameter combinations are produced. In these simulations, (1) the approach used to quantify each key parameter in the mass balance is randomly selected between the different methods evaluated, and (2) model parameters are generated via normally distributed random values based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of each parameter. The probability density function that best fits the data distribution obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations was determined using least-squares fitting (SciPy library for the Python programming language). Statistical distributions tested included Beta, Binomial, χ 2 , Noncentral χ 2 , F, Noncentral F, Gamma, Negative Binomial, Normal, Poisson, Student's t, and Noncentral t.

42,10.1002/lno.11678,11,True,"## Results and discussion
## Sensitivity of porewater fluxes to mass balance parameters
The results of the sensitivity analysis are shown in Fig. 3. Porewater fluxes (F PW ) are not sensitive to changes in lagoon area (A) because both relevant input and output terms are scaled to A (see Eqs. 1.1, 1.2), counteracting the effects of potential changes on this parameter. Porewater fluxes are highly sensitive to water depth for 224 Ra because the main sink term (radioactive decay) depends on h, but none of the relevant sources do. For 222 Rn, porewater fluxes are less sensitive to changes in h because its main sink is gas evasion to the atmosphere, which does not depend on water depth. Both A and h (or V) can however represent an important source of uncertainty in other shallow systems with intricate and variable shapes and bathymetries, and thus they need to be accurately determined (Trigg et al. 2014). In the case of this study, A and h were determined from satellite images and a detailed bathymetry map by interpolating echosounder data accurately georeferenced with a differential GPS (Rodellas et al. 2018), and thus we assume that these parameters are well constrained and they are not further discussed here. Q str , C str , Q out , C Ra , X sed , and C sus can be sometimes difficult to accurately constrain. However, errors on their quantification for La Palme Lagoon produce relatively small changes on porewater flux estimates (a change of 25% produces errors < 5% in F PW ).",False,False,False,

In the case of radon, the results are also highly sensitive to the gas exchange velocity (k), for example, a change of 25% in k will produce a change of $ 30% in F PW . The final estimates are also highly sensitive to the assumption of steady-state conditions. A daily change in tracer concentrations ( ∂C ∂t ) of 5% will result in relative errors in the final F PW estimates of $ 7% for 222 Rn and as much as $ 60% for 224 Ra.",False,True,False,
44,10.1002/lno.11678,13,True,"Relative uncertainties associated with mass balance parameters can greatly vary depending on the parameter and the approach used to quantify it (from < 10% to > 100%). For instance, recent studies estimating porewater fluxes using 224 Ra or 222 Rn have attributed relative uncertainties of 10-90% to desorption from resuspended sediments (VÁX sed ÁC sus ), 20-50% to diffusion from sediments(F dif ÁA), 0-30% to surface water inputs (Q str ÁC str ), 20-100% to atmospheric evasion (kÁAÁC), 20-100% to export offshore (Q out ÁC), and 10-70% to radioactive decay (λÁVÁC) (Wong et al. 2013;Garcia-Orellana et al. 2014;Luek and Beck 2014;Rocha et al. 2016;Sadat-Noori et al. 2017;Chen et al. 2020). Figure 4 depicts the uncertainty introduced to final estimates of F PW assuming that total inputs (excluding F PW ) or outputs have an arbitrary relative uncertainty of 25%. A higher relative contribution of porewater fluxes as a tracer source into the studied system (i.e., the ratio F PW ÁA/total inputs) will always result in a lower relative uncertainty to the final fluxes. For example, total outputs with a relative uncertainty of 25% will always produce estimates of F PW with an associated uncertainty higher than > 100% if the relative contribution of porewater fluxes as a tracer source is lower than 25% (Fig. 4). The importance of specific input (e.g., diffusion from sediments, inputs from streams or rivers) and output fluxes (e.g., radioactive decay, export offshore, or evasion to the atmosphere) as a source of uncertainty additionally depends on their importance relative to other tracer sources and sinks in the studied system. For instance, F PW might be highly sensitive to tracer inputs from streams or rivers in areas with significant surface water inputs (e.g., estuaries) (Luek and Beck 2014), whereas it might be highly sensitive to diffusive fluxes in shallow areas covered by fine-grained sediments rich in uranium and thorium series nuclides (Rodellas et al. 2015b). Similarly, the export of tracer offshore in open systems (e.g., coastal ocean) is likely to represent the main 222 Rn and 224 Ra loss term in the mass balance and the porewater flux estimates will be highly sensitive to the estimation of this term (Burnett et al. 2007).",False,False,False,
45,10.1002/lno.11678,14,True,"## Conceptual uncertainties intrinsic to the mass balance
Aside from the key parameters determined from the sensitivity analysis, there are additional conceptual uncertainties derived from the numerous simplifications and assumptions that are required for the parametrization of the mass balance (e.g., what processes to include and to neglect, how to parametrize them, etc.). These errors in approximating the real system are intrinsic to each model and cannot be addressed through the evaluation of model parameters conducted in this study (Tebaldi and Knutti 2007). Constraining all these structural uncertainties is beyond the scope of this study. However, we would like to highlight here a key general assumption in the mass balance approach: all the model parameters are assumed constant with respect to the timescale of the tracer used. If transient processes occur during the time that the tracer resides in the system (e.g., temporally variable stream inputs, change of wind conditions that influence radon evasion to the atmosphere), this could lead to significant errors in porewater flux estimations and transient models should be implemented instead (Gilfedder et al. 2015). All studies based on tracer mass balances should therefore estimate the timescale of the tracer applied to assess the values that best represent the transient parameters over this timescale. The tracer residence time can be calculated by dividing the tracer inventory in surface waters by the sum of all tracer losses. Based on the 222 Rn and 224 Ra mass balances (Eqs. 1.1, 1.2), the average tracer residence time in the system (t tracer ) can thus be estimated as follows:
where Q out V can be approximated by the water residence time (τ) if the role of evaporation is assumed to be negligible (description of terms in Table 1). Notice also that k only applies to 222 Rn. The average tracer residence times for 222 Rn and Ra by total inputs (excluding F PW ) or outputs as a function of the relative contribution of porewater fluxes as a tracer source (F PW ÁA/Total inputs). An arbitrary relative uncertainty of 25% is attributed to either total inputs (F in ) or outputs (F out ), which are considered as the only source of uncertainty. This figure is calculated from Eqs. 1.1 and 1.2 by assuming steadystate conditions ( ∂CV ∂t = 0) and thus recognizing that
isotopes for study sites with different characteristics are shown in Fig. 5. Using the data in Table 1 and Eq. 2, the average 222 Rn and 224 Ra residence time in La Palme Lagoon is $ 1 d and $ 5 d, respectively. The different parameters in the mass balances should thus be representative of this indicative timescale.

47,10.1002/lno.11678,16,True,"## Average tracer concentration in surface waters C
Like in most published studies, the 222 Rn and 224 Ra mass balance used here is a simple zero-dimensional single-box model and thus it assumes that all the output fluxes are derived from C (i.e., radioactive decay, evasion to the atmosphere, mixing with low-concentration waters) (Fig. 2). Therefore, errors on the determination of C will introduce proportional errors in all the tracer output fluxes. This assumption is correct for radioactive decay. However, significant bias can be introduced to tracer estimates when assuming that water outflows at the ""boundaries of the box"" occur at mean 222 Rn and 224 Ra concentrations. The offshore tracer flux (Q out ÁC) plays a minor role as a sink of 222 Rn and 224 Ra in La Palme Lagoon, and thus this simplification has minor effects on porewater flux estimates, but this can be relevant in systems where water outflow is an important sink term. Assuming that 222 Rn evasion to the atmosphere occurs at C might also introduce some additional uncertainties to the final estimates, because gas exchange will occur at the average concentration immediately below the air-water interface, which might be different from the average concentration within the defined box (C).Spatial variability of tracer concentrations can compromise the results of the mass balance if the sampling distribution is not adequate and if the spatial interpolation of data does not produce representative results. Rapaglia et al. (2012) applied a location-allocation model to determine the optimal distribution of samples for field collection. Some authors have also used inverse modeling techniques to obtain an average tracer concentration in large regions with low sampling densities (Kwon et al. 2014;Le Gland et al. 2017); however, these approaches are rarely applied in small-scale studies and most of the authors collect a relatively large number of samples to derive average tracer concentrations.",False,False,False,

Assuming that the sample distribution is adequate to capture local conditions and that each sample is representative of the whole water column could thus introduce additional uncertainties to C.",False,False,False,
49,10.1002/lno.11678,18,True,"Here we evaluate only the uncertainties introduced by the spatial-averaging approach by comparing four different commonly applied ways to obtain C: (1) direct averages of measured tracer concentrations (Beck et al. 2007;Tamborski et al. 2017), (2) averages of tracer inventories divided by average water depth (Moore et al. 2008;Rodellas et al. 2017), (3) averages from a deterministic interpolation method (inverse distance weighting [IDW]; using a power parameter P of 5) (Sadat-Noori et al. 2017;Correa et al. 2020); and (4) averages from a geostatistical interpolation method (kriging) (Gu et al. 2012;Baudron et al. 2015). It should be noted that results from interpolation methods can also vary depending on the parameters and analysis used (e.g., maximum C changes of $ 15% when using different power parameters for IDW). Since sampling stations were homogeneously distributed, results obtained from the three latter approaches are similar, with C ranging from 112 to 136 Bq m -3 for 222 Rn and 19 to 23 Bq m -3 for 224 Ra. However, obtaining C from the first approach (i.e., direct averages of Tracer residence time (d) Water residence time (d)   222 Rn 224 Ra 223 Ra 228 Ra & 226 Ra concentrations; 174 Bq m -3 and 28 Bq m -3 for 222 Rn and 224 Ra, respectively) leads to significantly greater values for C (Kruskal-Wallis test; p < 0.05). This is likely because direct averages of tracer concentrations will tend to over-represent conditions in shallower areas and, given that shallower areas usually concentrate higher tracer inputs per volume unit, they may often produce an overestimation of C. Excluding the results from direct concentration averages, different approaches produce C varying within 10-20% (Table 2). These conceptual uncertainties, which only consider the spatialaveraging approach and exclude other potential sources of uncertainty (e.g., inappropriate sample distribution), are comparable to the analytical uncertainties associated with the measurements of 222 Rn (e.g., 10-50% in La Palme Lagoon), but considerably higher than those associated with 224 Ra analysis (e.g., 5-10%).

Radon loss to the atmosphere constitutes one of the major sinks in the radon mass balance (Burnett et al. 2007). The determination of the gas transfer velocity (k) is thus one of the most crucial parameters in the estimation of porewater fluxes. Gas transfer velocities in radon studies are generally estimated using empirical equations that estimate k as a function of wind speed (Dulaiova et al. 2010;Dimova and Burnett 2011). Whereas these equations are relatively well parameterized for open ocean conditions (Wanninkhof 2014), using them for shallow open water surfaces at land-ocean interfaces (e.g., lakes, lagoons, estuaries, or the coastal ocean) is expected to add significant uncertainties (Kremer et al. 2003;Cockenpot et al. 2015;Weber et al. 2019). In shallow and small environments, k might be significantly influenced by parameters others than wind speed, such as fetch area, bottom roughness, turbidity, current velocity, or ecosystem size (Borges et al. 2004;Vachon and Prairie 2013).Another important issue is how to apply these empirical relationships correctly in systems with varying wind speeds. The gas transfer velocity is frequently calculated based on punctual wind speed observations during the sampling campaign or averages of specific time periods (few hours, 1-2 d, etc.). However, errors can be introduced if prior conditions that might have affected observed radon inventories are not considered (Schubert et al. 2019). In addition, wind measurements are commonly made from nearby meteorological stations located on land, and the different roughness lengths (i.e., friction) of vegetated areas vs. open water complicate extrapolating the land-based wind measurements to open water conditions (Vachon and Prairie 2013).To evaluate the conceptual uncertainties associated with the determination of gas transfer velocities (k) for La Palme Lagoon, we compare how different parameterizations of gas transfer velocities influences the results. First, different ways of calculating wind speeds are used as input parameters for wind-k relationships, using the empirical relationships of MacIntyre et al. (1995) as a base equation.

Representative average wind speeds (scaled to 10 m above the surface) are estimated in four different ways and then subsequently used to derive gas transfer velocities from the wind-k equation of MacIntyre et al.

A weighting factor for the importance of degassing events depending on its proximity to the sampling campaign (w t ) is adapted from (Schubert et al. 2019) based on the radon decay constant (λ) and the gas transfer velocity (k) as primary controls on radon inventories for La Palme Lagoon:

Differences between approaches thus depend on the specific wind conditions prior to and during a survey. We thus suggest that introducing the weighting factor w t (Eqs. 6.1, 6.2) is the best option to account for degassing events occurring at different times.Different approaches to estimate k. To compare the estimates of k derived from different approaches, we use four commonly applied empirical degassing equations that relate k with wind speeds in different settings (i-iv), an empirical relationship that introduces the effects of system size (v) and a site-specific experimental estimation of k for La Palme Lagoon (vi).

Most studies assume steady state conditions in radon and radium mass balance models (Beck et al. 2007;Liu et al. 2017;Sadat-Noori et al. 2017). This implies that tracer inputs equal tracer outputs and that these fluxes are constant for the timescale of the tracer. Achieving steady state conditions for 222 Rn would require few days of constant meteorological conditions, as a consequence of the rapidly changing wind-dependent 222 Rn evasion to the atmosphere (Gilfedder et al. 2015). Several studies have indeed suggested that dynamic modeling is often a more accurate representation than steady state mass balances for 222 Rn -based approaches (Cook et al. 2008;Dimova and Burnett 2011;Gilfedder et al. 2015), but this still requires knowledge of the transience of all model parameters. As radium is not sensitive to gas exchange rate, which is highly temporally variable, it might be reasonable to assume that 224 Ra concentrations in surface waters are less variable than 222 Rn concentrations. However, 224 Ra is generally more sensitive to the steady state assumption than 222 Rn (i.e., a similar variability in the concentration results in a larger error in the porewater flux: Fig. 3). Thus, the change of 224 Ra inventory over time needs to be accurately determined in dynamic water bodies with transient sources or sinks on the timescale of the tracer (e.g., tidal-influenced systems; Sadat-Noori et al. 2015).",False,False,False,

Given that the change of tracer concentrations over time was not measured during sampling time, we are using complementary samplings conducted in periods with similar conditions to constrain ∂C ∂t . These numbers thus need to be treated with some caution. Minimum and maximum daily changes of 222 Rn concentrations ( ∂C ∂t ) are obtained from the continuous 5-d monitoring of 222 Rn concentrations (26 April 2016-01 May 2016, using the 1 st and 3 rd quartiles of all the measurements in wind conditions comparable to those found in June 2016; Fig. 6).

Interestingly, 224 Ra porewater fluxes estimated from the direct quantification are outside and below the range of fluxes obtained with the single model ensemble. This is mainly because the direct estimation was obtained from the lowest average concentration (C obtained from averaging inventories) and the highest diffusive flux (F dif obtained from incubation experiments), which are the approaches that produce the lowest porewater fluxes. This disagreement reveals that the real uncertainties associated with porewater flux estimates are much higher than the propagated uncertainties initially estimated. Relative uncertainties associated with 222 Rn-derived fluxes ($ 70%) are significantly larger than those associated to 224 Ra estimates ($ 30%). These uncertainties should not be directly compared because different approaches have been used to evaluate the different mass balance parameters for 222 Rn and 224 Ra. However, higher uncertainties are expected for 222 Rn in La Palme Lagoon as a consequence of the large uncertainties associated with the determination of the gas transfer velocity (k), which only affects 222 Rn. This might not be the case for other systems where mixing losses due to exchange with lowconcentration offshore waters (Q out ) play a comparatively major role, because radium mass balances (particularly for the long-lived radium isotopes) are more sensitive to these outflows than radon mass balances are (Tamborski et al. 2020).",False,True,False,

Using the 222 Rn profiles reported in Rodellas et al.

Some of the key uncertainties associated with the estimation of porewater fluxes to La Palme Lagoon by using radon ( 222 Rn) and radium ( 224 Ra) mass balances were evaluated in this study. While some of the results are site-dependent (it is a shallow, semi-enclosed lagoon), the general understanding and conclusions derived from this work provide guidelines to better constrain the magnitude of uncertainties of porewater fluxes estimated from radioactive tracers in coastal and freshwater ecosystems (e.g., lakes, lagoons, marshes, bays, coastal sea). This understanding can therefore be extended to other systems worldwide, as well as to other radium isotopes ( 223 Ra, 228 Ra, and 226 Ra) and tracers (e.g., dissolved silica, CH 4 , salinity).Uncertainty assessments in radon-and radium-based porewater flux estimates commonly attribute all sources of uncertainty to analytical errors in mass balance parameters or to their natural variability, neglecting conceptual uncertainties implicit in their assumptions. Uncertainties linked to the conceptualization of the mass balance are a primary source of uncertainty of porewater flux estimates. Neglecting conceptual uncertainties may thus lead to unrepresentative estimations of tracer-derived porewater fluxes.There is not a general framework for assessing these conceptual uncertainties, but in this study, we provide an example of an accessible approach to address uncertainties associated to the estimation of porewater fluxes. We used a single model ensemble where the most sensitive mass balance parameters were identified and subsequently evaluated using different commonly applied approaches. The uncertainties associated with porewater flux estimates can then be quantified by using a set of simulations with a single tracer mass balance but a set of different options for the relevant model parameters. The use of multiple independent methods (e.g., hydrogeological approaches, seepage meters, different tracers) can also contribute to constraining the magnitude of porewater fluxes, although this interpretation needs to be addressed in a qualitative way because the different models may capture different components of porewater fluxes (e.g., shallow vs. deep fluxes, different spatiotemporal integrations, etc.).",False,False,False,

Recommendations derived from this study are:
• The average radon or radium concentration in surface waters (C) is always a critical component of the mass balance (C directly influences all the tracer output fluxes). An appropriate characterization of C relies on an optimal distribution of sampling stations and on their appropriate spatial averaging. Using direct averages of tracer concentrations to obtain C (a commonly applied approach) will always overrepresent tracer concentrations in shallow areas, and should be avoided. Other averaging methods (e.g., averaging inventories, interpolation methods) are likely to produce more accurate estimates of C, but there can be issues related to the representativeness of sampling stations. Uncertainties associated with interpolation methods should not be neglected. • Diffusive fluxes of radon and radium estimated using different approaches may easily vary by a factor of 2-3. The selection of the approach itself can thus produce tracer diffusive fluxes with large relative uncertainties (most likely higher than 50%). • The determination of the gas exchange rate (k) is a critical source of uncertainty to final 222 Rn-derived porewater flux estimates in shallow systems with relatively long residence times (e.g., coastal lagoons and semi-enclosed basins). The empirical parameterization of k itself can produce k estimates varying by up to an order of magnitude. Unless k can be deduced from site-specific experiments reflecting marine and atmospheric conditions during the time of sampling, the relative uncertainties associated with the determination of this parameter are likely to exceed 50%. Importantly, the determination of representative wind speeds for these parametrizations (u) can also introduce large uncertainties to the determination of k. Introducing a weighting factor to wind speeds occurring at different times is likely the best option for constraining u. • A major assumption in the application of tracer mass balances is that all the model parameters are constant during the time the tracer resides in the system (if a transient model is not used). The potential temporal variability of all the parameters should be considered relative to the residence time of the tracer in the system. This will be tracer and site dependent. • Steady-state conditions for radon are unlikely in systems where gas exchange represents a primary loss term (i.e., shallow lakes, lagoons, and wetlands). Dynamic modeling should therefore be considered for these systems. Although radium is not subject to gas exchange, estimates of porewater fluxes can also be affected by transient sources and sinks (e.g., wind-driven changes on export offshore, temporally variable stream discharges, or porewater fluxes) and this variability should also be considered.",False,False,False,

## Abstract


## Untitled Section
In recent years, the integration of autonomous sensors and big data analytics has revolutionized our understanding of aquatic systems in both oceanography and limnology by advancing, for example, our three-dimensional comprehension of historically data-poor regions using Argo floats and gliders (Claustre et al. 2020;Vance et al. 2024). These cuttingedge technologies provide unprecedented insights into the complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological processes in aquatic systems (Chai et al. 2025). Autonomous systems equipped with the appropriate sensors are capable of continuous, in-situ monitoring and can capture vast datasets across various temporal and spatial scales, from small-scale changes in water chemistry to global-scale patterns. Meanwhile, big data techniques enable the processing and analysis of this immense volume of information, revealing new patterns at large spatial and temporal scales and facilitating predictive modeling of aquatic environments (Durden et al. 2017).This special issue builds upon the foundational work presented in the previous Autonomous and Lagrangian Platforms and Sensors special issue (Dickey et al. 2008), which highlighted the potential of various autonomous platforms in aquatic research. The companion virtual issue gathers additional articles previously published in Limnology and Oceanography with topics related to Autonomous Instrumentations and Big Data, and is now available at https://aslopubs.  onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/toc/10.1002/(ISSN)1939-5590.big- data. This virtual issue currently comprises 90 articles, a number that will grow as new papers related to this field are published in the journal.In the present special issue, we present diverse studies that showcase the application, development, and use of autonomous sensors, machine learning, and big data analyses in investigations of various thematics such as plankton and carbon export, phytoplankton and marine heatwaves, primary productivity, parasitism, lake oxygen and methane dynamics, and water mass structures.",False,False,False,

The authors assess how a persistent mesoscale front influenced both plankton concentrations and particle distribution throughout a bloom period and highlight the implications for biogeochemical processes. Complementing this work, Gastauer and Ohman (2025) study the transitions of zooplankton communities across frontal gradients in the California Current system. By employing an autonomous Zooglider, an underwater glider equipped with a shadowgraph camera, they identify shifts in community composition and abundance related to hydrodynamic changes and emphasize the role of environmental gradients in structuring zooplankton populations. Going further than the identification of species, Pata and Hunt (2025) introduced a centralized database of zooplankton traits, consolidating 33 disparate datasets into a harmonized framework. This newly created database will promote sharing of trait data, and could allow a deeper understanding of the ecological roles of zooplankton.",False,False,False,

Patterns found in their study reveal changes in photoacclimation across different time scales (daily to interannual), demonstrating that cellular pigment density responds dynamically to environmental conditions. Using a combination of DNA meta-barcoding and automated imaging-in-flow cytometry, Catlett et al. (2025) explore diatom parasitism. They document the infection dynamics of the diatom Guinardia delicatula by two parasites and demonstrate that environmental factors such as salinity and temperature shape parasitisms, with significant implications for diatom community dynamics. Finally, Traylor et al. (2025) contrast phytoplankton production and carbon export in an iron-limited, highly regenerative regime in the North Pacific, and during the spring bloom in the North Atlantic where efficient carbon export is expected. They combined autonomous Biogeochemical Argo profiling float, underwater glider, and shipboard measurements from the EXPORTS campaigns, and demonstrate that almost all production was routed to sinking particle export in the North Pacific, whereas near-equal proportions were routed to sinking particles and dissolved organic carbon in the North Atlantic.Two additional studies focused on heatwaves and their impact on phytoplankton dynamics. In their study, Black et al. (2025) analyzed large amounts of open-access data to quantify the effects of marine heatwaves on coastal phytoplankton biomass off the Oregon coast. They reveal that, during marine heatwave years, phytoplankton distribution is significantly altered, with biomass being compressed closer to shore, which has profound implications for nutrient dynamics and the overall productivity of the ecosystem. Fischer et al. (2025) investigate the relationship between marine heatwaves and harmful algal blooms caused by diatom species of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Using images from a FlowCytobot, they compare bloom dynamics during a marine heatwave year to a temperature-neutral year to highlight the nuanced interplay between environmental conditions and algal toxin production. They show that the timing of the heatwave relative to seasonal upwelling controls the occurrence of harmful algal blooms.",False,False,False,

(2025) applied machine learning techniques to a variety of oceanographic datasets collected by underwater gliders to differentiate water masses of species distributions and interactions. Their research exemplifies the promise of computational techniques in analyzing large volumes of environmental data, thereby enhancing predictive modeling capabilities. The role of big data in ecological research is also illustrated by Pata and Hunt (2025) with the development of a centralized database for marine zooplankton traits constructed with aggregating 33 datasets. This harmonized database provides the base of a centralized compilation of thousands of trait records which can be extended by additional resources. The database will allow exploring new ecological patterns and ecosystemic roles played by zooplankton.The use of autonomous instrumentation also allows studying the biogeochemistry of lakes and notably dissolved oxygen and methane dynamics. Using a novel in-situ incubation method, Hudspeth et al. (2025) assessed aerobic methane oxidation in freshwater environments and determined reaction kinetics over varying environmental conditions. Their observations suggest that methane oxidation rates are closely coupled to dissolved oxygen levels. Robbins et al. (2025) use autonomous oxygen and temperature profilers to study oxygen dynamics by comparing oxygen predictability across various reservoir types. Their analyses reveal that thermally stratified reservoirs exhibit more consistent oxygen patterns compared to polymictic counterparts and highlight that the interplay between thermal stratification and oxygen levels can dictate the biological and chemical processes in reservoirs. These results underscore the importance of understanding reservoir properties and their implications for water quality management and ecological integrity.In conclusion, the integration of autonomous instrumentation and big data analytics continue to transform aquatic research, allowing us to unravel complex ecological, physical, and biogeochemical dynamics with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The articles of this special issue, as well as in the accompanying virtual issue, illustrate the vast potential of these technologies across a range of themes-from plankton dynamics and carbon export to the impacts of marine heatwaves and biogeochemical processes in freshwater environments.

## Abstract
Global change impacts marine organisms and communities mainly through ocean warming, acidification, deoxygenation, and changes in nutrient inputs and water circulation. To assess the ecological impacts of global change, the effects of multiple interacting environmental drivers, including their fluctuations, should be tested at different levels of biological organization. In an outdoor mesocosm study, we investigated the differential effects of three simulated upwelling events coupled with ocean warming (1-5 C above ambient) on a temperate benthic community in the Western Baltic Sea. Ocean warming, especially in summer when temperatures are close to or above the physiological optimum of many species, is likely to impose thermal stress with species-specific impacts. As the properties of deep water vary seasonally, so will the effects of upwelling. Upwelling of cooler deep water in midsummer may alleviate thermal stress, although this mitigation may be modulated by upwelling-associated shifts in other water-quality parameters such as salinity, nutrients, or late-summer hypoxia. This investigation showed that in the Western Baltic Ocean warming was rather beneficial in early and late summer but detrimental when ambient temperatures were highest in midsummer. The effects of upwelling in the absence of ocean warming were generally weakly beneficial, while this effect tended to vanish with intensifying imposed ocean warming. Hypoxia associated with the late summer upwelling impacted some of the grazer species but did not impact the macroalgae. We conclude that in coastal temperate benthic communities, ocean warming is the predominant stressor that may partially and seasonally be buffered by upwelling.",False,False,False,

Intensifying global change is a major driver of ecological change, with already many documented alarming manifestations (Harley et al. 2006). Yet, empirical (experimental) understanding of the complex nature of these impacts is needed to develop improved predictive models of future impacts. Experimental research on the ecological impacts of global change faces a threefold challenge (Boyd et al. 2018): (1) upscaling from single to multiple drivers, (2) incorporating their natural and often asynchronous fluctuations in space and time (Gunderson et al. 2016), and (3) upscaling from physiological to community responses (Bates et al. 2018). In marine ecosystems, ecological realism requires considering the combined effects of numerous baseline-shifting drivers. These can be of mechanical, physical, chemical or biological nature. Depending on their synchronous or sequential occurrence, these shifting drivers can have synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effects (Gunderson et al. 2016;Kroeker et al. 2016). While the need for multistressor experiments designed to evaluate effects across ecological scales is increasingly recognized, it represents a major conceptual and practical challenge for researchers, which requires the consideration of compromises between complexity and feasibility (Boyd et al. 2018;Wake 2019). The number of drivers included in a single experiment must be selectively limited to avoid overstretching infrastructural and analytical resources. The most relevant drivers for coastal marine organisms may be the predicted changes in temperature, current and wave regimes, stratification, nutrient loads, oxygen levels, salinity, fishing, constructions, and chemical, noise and light pollution (Bindoff et al. 2019). In addition, each environmental driver may fluctuate with different frequencies and amplitudes (Vasseur et al. 2014;Gunderson et al. 2016). The temporal match or mismatch between fluctuations in stress intensity (defined by the timing, amplitude and duration of stressful events) and the biology of species will determine their survival and potential for acclimation and adaptation (Kroeker et al. 2019;Rilov et al. 2019).",False,False,False,
91,10.1002/lno.11954,2,True,"Ocean warming (""warming"" hereafter) is considered the paramount driver of many global change scenarios (Bates and Johnson 2020;Wahl et al. 2020). Its influence on metabolic rates exerts universal ecological shifts across levels of biological organization in marine systems (Brown et al. 2004;Schramski et al. 2015;Provost et al. 2017). Warming will-in a seasonally variable manner-interact with the setting of further environmental parameters. The ecologically most relevant parameters in coastal areas are salinity, oxygen, and-to a lesser extent and variable among functional groups-pH and nutrient levels (Kwiatkowski and Orr 2018). For instance, ocean warming promotes aquatic deoxygenation in several ways (Rabalais et al. 2009(Rabalais et al. , 2014) ) by reducing the solubility of oxygen in water, enhancing thermal stratification, and accelerating microbial remineralization, ultimately resulting in oxygen depletion in subthermocline waters (Alvisi and Cozzi 2016;van Helmond et al. 2017;Breitburg et al. 2018). Conversely, at a regional and local scale, warming may be substantially mitigated by wind-driven coastal upwelling of cooler bottom waters (Varela et al. 2018;Suursaar 2020). This interaction between warming and upwelling is the focus of the current study. Upwelled cool waters can mask extreme heating events offering temporary thermal refugia to coastal communities, when occurring simultaneously (Chollett et al. 2010;Paalme et al. 2019). Upwelling may additionally modify nutrient concentrations, salinity, pH, and/or oxygen of surface waters. Since water temperature, primary production, stratification, and salinity all vary throughout the year with different frequency, periodicity, and amplitude, we can expect the resulting abiotic characteristics of the upwelled water to differ from one upwelling event to the other. In addition, these parameters are predicted to further shift with global change over the coming decades. Increased eutrophication trends in coastal surface waters (Andersen et al. 2017) may weaken the formerly beneficial fertilizing effect of upwelling through spring and summer. Ocean acidification may enhance the corrosive nature of upwelled water in summer and autumn (Melzner et al. 2013). However, the most alarming may be the spreading of deoxygenated subsurface waters in shallow coastal systems worldwide (Diaz 2001). Upwelling of this deoxygenated deep water may cause severe mortalities in fishes and benthic invertebrates such as crabs (Grantham et al. 2004). We can presume that warming and upwelling may both be beneficial and detrimental depending on the timing of occurrence (Wahl et al. 2020), and when they cooccur their interaction can be expected to be anywhere on the gradient from antagonistic to synergistic.",False,False,False,
92,10.1002/lno.11954,3,True,"Species differentially respond to environmental shifts driven by stressors such as warming and upwelling based on their traits and life histories. The sensitivity of a given organism may also depend on the stress history it has experienced within its lifetime (Walter et al. 2013) or across a selection process (Pansch et al. 2014;Al-Janabi et al. 2019). If the sensitivities of different ontogenetic stages and species to a given environmental setting differ, changes in the nature and strength of biological interactions may change, and ultimately lead to compositional shifts in the community.Warming, deoxygenation, and increasing wind-driven upwelling intensity seems to progress particularly fast in the Baltic Sea (Carstensen et al. 2014;Gammal et al. 2017;Reusch et al. 2018). In this shallow, a tidal and rather land-locked sea (Medvedev et al. 2016) with a somewhat dampened current regime, physicochemical properties may differ strongly between surface and bottom water bodies in summer due to a pronounced thermohaline stratification and notoriously high nutrient loads. In this season, subsurface waters tend to be more saline, colder, richer in nutrients, and poorer in oxygen (Lehmann et al. 2012 Wahl et al. Benthic community under fluctuating pressures et al. 2019; Suursaar 2020) (Box 1). In winter, however, waters are well mixed and upwelling will hardly alter the physicochemical water properties in shallow habitats.In the Baltic Sea, the communities associated to the foundation species Fucus spp. are among the most diverse and ecologically valuable (Kautsky et al. 1992). These communities are exposed to increasing environmental stress in the course of global change (Werner et al. 2016;Barboza et al. 2019), as are many productive and diverse macroalgae-based communities worldwide (Koch et al. 2013;Wahl et al. 2015b).",False,False,False,

The majority of the species in the investigated benthic community have immigrated from the North Sea into the Baltic Sea several millennia ago. The broad tolerance range with regard to most physicochemical water conditions allowed these species to persist in the extreme and highly fluctuating environmental conditions of this marginal sea (Pansch et al. 2014;Paalme et al. 2019), but with decreasing performance rates when environmental parameters lie below or above their optima (Wahl et al. 2020;Vajedsamiei et al. 2021). For Fucus vesiculosus, and most other organisms interacting with it, the physiological optima are found (with considerable variation) in a temperature range between 10 C and 20 C, a salinity range between 20 and 33, a pH range between 7.5 and 9, and an oxygen range between 6 and 10 mg L À1 (Barboza et al. 2019;Wahl et al. 2020) (more information on species-specific requirements are presented in Supporting Information Table S1).",False,True,False,

This treatment will be called ""simulated upwelling"" in the following sections as previously done in similar studies (Taucher et al. 2017). Given the species-specific comfort zones, we hypothesized that the most important interacting taxa of this system, macroalgae, epiphytes, and mesograzers (Jormalainen et al. 2008), would respond differently to the upwelling events in early summer, midsummer, or late summer, and that these respective impacts would vary among warming scenarios (Box 1). Specifically, we predicted that:
(1) warming may have beneficial effects when the ambient temperature is at suboptimal levels (in early summer or late summer), but is stressful to most organisms when levels are close to or higher than the species-specific thermal optima (in midsummer);
(2) upwelling of cooler water may mitigate warming in warmest part of summer, but may be stressful to many but not all species when the upwelled water is hypoxic in late summer; (3) differential responses of interacting species (macroalgae, grazers, foulers) may lead to interaction shifts and modulation of the direct impacts of warming or upwelling, or both; and (4) the compound impact of warming and upwelling changes across the different events within the summer season but is generally negative.",False,False,False,

The experiment on community-level impacts of warming and intermittent upwelling events ran from the beginning of May to mid-September 2018 in the Kiel Outdoor Benthocosms (KOB) facility (see details in the Supporting Information Data S1 and in Wahl et al. 2015a). Briefly, this experimental facility consists of 12 insulated 1500-L tanks positioned on an aluminum float in the Kiel Fjord (54.330119 N, 10.149742 E, Southwestern Baltic Sea, Germany). Computer-controlled heaters and chillers allowed the maintenance of temperature offset levels of 0 C, 1 C, 2 C, 3 C, 4 C, and 5 C above the naturally fluctuating fjord water sea surface temperature (SST). These warming levels covered the plausible range of warming scenarios over the coming eight decades in the Baltic Sea (BACC 2015). The expected effects of seasonal upwelling are based on many years of water column profiling (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Pumps ensured that unfiltered fjord water was continuously flowing through each tank at a rate of approximately 7 L min À1 , that is, the complete volume of each tank was exchanged seven times per day. Upwelling events were simulated by switching between two intake pipes, pumping in fjord water from: (1) 1 m depth for the nonupwelled treatment level and phases between upwelling events, and (2) 14 m depth, which is well below the thermocline in summer (mostly at 3-6 and 8-11 m in the past 10 years; see Supporting Information Fig. S2). The crossed treatments (one of the six temperature levels, with or without intermittent upwelling) were distributed randomly among the 12 tanks. The warming treatments operated throughout the 4.5 months of the experiment. Simulated upwelling events were imposed in half of the tanks on 03 July-09 July (upwelling 1, ""early summer""), 04 August-11 August (upwelling 2, ""midsummer""), and 28 August-03 September (upwelling 3, ""late summer""). In the upwelling-simulating tanks, after switching the intake pipes, surface water was replaced by the upwelled water at a rate of 7 tank volumes per day, recreating a gradual transition from surface to bottom conditions within 12-24 h (Fig. 1).",False,False,False,

In this season, the algae are still free of macroepiphytes. Three individuals of each algal species were wet-weighed and placed in each tank, constituting similar wet weight biomasses in all tanks. The macroalgae were individually marked with colored cable ties and nonfertile thallus tips were tagged 22 mm below the terminal meristem with a fluorescent fishing line (i.e., ""growth tag"") for growth assessment (see Wahl et al. 2020). The mesograzers were introduced in each tank recreating the mean densities found on the collected macroalgae on the day of sampling.

Additional algal material was added (equally to all tanks) after the second upwelling for an alga-grazer-interaction experiment performed during the third upwelling event (see further details below). An overview of the added or sampled biomasses is given in Supporting Information Table S2.

Specifically, we evaluated how their relative performance (growth, O 2 metabolism) and, thus, the presumed competitive ability (for light and limiting nutrients) may be affected by the (1) the presence of the other competing algal species in the same compartment, (2) the presence of mesograzers, and (3) the physicochemical conditions simulated by the warming and upwelling treatments.

Relationships between warming and a given response, stratified by upwelling and/or species were modeled as follows.Before modeling, pseudo-replicated data were averaged, for example, growth measurements performed on different algal individuals included in a given experimental unit (tank). The main and interactive effects of warming and upwelling on the performance of different taxa were evaluated using generalized additive models (GAMs). The modeling and post hoc comparison of trends were done using the mgcv and itsadug packages in R (Wood 2017). Multivariate dissimilarities among the assemblages of grazers exposed to the different warming and upwelling treatments, in three sampling events (beginning and after UPW2, and after UPW3), were visualized using nonmetric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) plots. The dissimilarities between assemblages were calculated based on species counts using the Bray-Curtis index. The best ordinations were defined through 2000 random iterations and the comparison of stress values, using the function metaMDS from the R package vegan (Oksanen et al. 2019). Final plots were produced using the package ggplot2 (Wickham et al. 2019).

## Macroalgal responses
Overall, there was no substantial net growth in all three macroalgal species over the entire course of the summer (Supporting Information Fig. S5, inter-species ANOVA: p > 0.1).

Sporadic upwelling of cooler waters had no direct significant effect on the species' growth.Differences in growth rate anomalies with respect to the overall mean of all treatments (z-score, Fig. 4) were mainly driven by warming, and to a lesser extent by upwelling in the absence of warming (only F. serratus in upwelling 1 and A. vermiculophylla in upwelling 1 and upwelling 2; GAM, Supporting Information Table S3).

The apparent competitive disadvantage (i.e., hampered growth) of F. serratus in a warming scenario relative to the two other macroalgae may, consequently, be attenuated by early-summer upwelling. In upwelling 2, all algal species feature progressively reduced growth rates with increasing warming. This warming-induced stress was partially mitigated by upwelling in F. vesiculosus, but enhanced in F. serratus and A. vermiculophylla in the warmest levels (Fig. 4). In A. vermiculophylla, upwelling also reduced growth in the coolest warming levels (warming 0-1 C). In upwelling 3, ambient temperatures had declined to be low-stress levels (Supporting Information Fig. S3a) and all algae species showed a slight increase in growth performance with warming. During this period, upwelling had no effects on growth responses to warming independently of the algal species, presumably because this simulated upwelling coincided with a natural upwelling event, and consequently, did not lead to substantial cooling or salination of the surface waters compared to deep water as had happened during the earlier events. The drop of oxygen and pH associated with upwelling 3 does not seem to affect growth of the three algal species. In that phase, A. vermiculophylla tended (not significantly) to have a higher GPP rate compared to F. vesiculosus (Fig. 5a). In both species, upwelling tended to enhance GPP in the absence of warming, while GPP was reduced by upwelling under warming. Also, during upwelling 3 both species showed an increased uptake of NO x as a proxy of nutrient balance, with warming in the absence of upwelling and a decrease with upwelling under warming (Fig. 5b).

Cumulatively, however, these specific responses to warming led to the observed (Supporting Information Fig. S6) overall decrease in mesograzer numbers in the system with intensifying warming levels between midsummer to late summer.## Microfouling and macrofouling
Although not significant in the absence of upwelling, bacterial fouling during upwelling 3 tended to decrease with warming.

On top of the ambient climatology we implemented various aspects of predicted Climate Change, that is, five levels of ocean warming and sporadic upwelling in different phases of the summer.

(2) Likely, warming enhanced the physiological processes causing biogenic day-night fluctuation of oxygen (Brown et al. 2004), which mitigated the negative effects of warming-driven reduction in oxygen saturation during daytime but exacerbated it during nighttime-up to the speciesspecific optimal temperature (T opt ) beyond which metabolic rates should decline.The three simulated sporadic upwelling events in early-summer, midsummer, and late summer (Fig. 1, upwelling 1-upwelling 3) produced very disparate physicochemical mosaics (sensu Kroeker et al. 2016). In summary, given the fluctuating environmental conditions in combination with the simulated warming upwelling 1 should be moderately beneficial, upwelling 2 strongly beneficial and upwelling 3 detrimental to the majority of species in the Fucus community, but the strength and direction of these effects were likely to differ among the species. Below we discuss the species-specific responses.",False,False,False,
115,10.1002/lno.11954,26,True,"F. vesiculosus benefited from warming in the colder period, and was harmed from it in the warmer phase. Upwelling decreased F. vesiculosus growth at the higher warming levels in early summer, enhanced growth at all warming levels (except ambient) in midsummer, and had no effect in late summer. This closely matches the expectations based on the thermal requirements of F. vesiculosus (Graiff et al. 2015;Al-Janabi et al. 2019). In an Irish Sea study (Brooks and Crowe 2018), no warming impact on F. vesiculosus was detected. Possibly thermal stress in this study was lower because the baseline temperature (on which warming levels were imposed) was further below the optimal temperature of F. vesiculosus than in the Baltic, or because T opt of this population was higher, or the stress was applied for a shorter period. The second native macroalga, F. serratus, generally suffered from warming except in the cooler late-summer period. A more pronounced sensitivity to warming F. serratus as compared to F. vesiculosus was described earlier (Brooks and Crowe 2018) with substantial thermal impacts beyond 22 C in all populations studied (Martinez et al. 2012). Jueterbock et al. (2014), however, describe substantial differences among European populations of F. serratus with regard to their sensitivity to heat pulses.Upwelling had weak or no effects on growth in all phases of the experiment. The invasive species, A. vermiculophylla, seemed to benefit from warming, except in midsummer. Upwelling decreased its growth at higher warming levels except in the cooler late summer. Since A. vermiculophylla is capable of living at extremely low nutrient concentrations (Jensen et al. 2007), it may not have benefitted from the nutrient-enrichment caused by upwelling.Only in late summer, upwelling did not modulate the warming effects. The cumulative effect of the three upwelling events tended to mitigate the detrimental effects of warming on the 4.5-monthgrowth of all three species.",False,False,False,
116,10.1002/lno.11954,27,True,"The observed decrease of macroalgal growth with actual summer warming and simulated future warming has been predicted and observed before at regional (Graiff et al. 2015;Graba-Landry et al. 2018) and global (Harvey et al. 2013;Koch et al. 2013;Wahl et al. 2015b) scales. In the present experiment, the negative growth effect was presumably a direct impact rather than indirect effect caused by an increase of grazing rates. Since the lowest temperature in the tanks without imposed warming during all three upwelling events (19 C, 20 C, and 17 C, respectively) was above the optimal temperatures (T opt ) for Idotea spp. (14 C) and Littorina spp. (17 C) (Wahl et al. 2020), all warming levels should have decreased the grazing activities of these two mesograzer groups. Only amphipod activity (T opt = 21 C) could have been enhanced by moderate warming (Gilson et al. 2021). However, it is likely that such warming-induced increase in grazer activity was partially or completely suppressed by the hypoxia stress experienced during upwelling 3 as seen in the incubation experiments. This effect was particularly conspicuous at higher warming levels where the absence of upwelling increased grazing activity and algal biomass loss (in this cooler part of the season), while in the presence of hypoxic upwelling, the grazing effect decreased. In addition, warming led to a decrease in grazer numbers. This shrinking of the grazer population is likely to have (over-) compensated any hypothetical increase of per capita grazing which in addition was limited to the amphipods. The shrinking of mesograzer biomass with warming has been suggested to reflect a mismatch between the warming-driven increase of metabolic rates (Brown et al. 2004) and a finite digestive tract limiting any compensatory feeding (Gilson et al. 2021). The observed detrimental impact on juvenile grazers may hint at a potential carryover effect, since a decrease in the abundance of juveniles under heat stress will translate to a decrease in the abundance of adults even when the stress ceases. Hypoxic upwelling in late summer will exacerbate and slightly redirect these structural shifts in the mesograzer community since it causes substantial mortality in crustacean grazers whereas gastropods seem less sensitive to low oxygen levels (Larade and Storey 2007). Grazing pressure on particular macroalgal species may have changed not only due to the general decrease in mesograzer numbers but also to the restructuring of the mesograzer community, since the different consumer species differ with regard to their feeding preferences. Such preferences may (Nejrup et al. 2012) or may not (Barboza et al. 2019) differ among populations. The Kiel Bight population of F. vesiculosus is preferred over co-occurring A. vermiculophylla by the isopod I. balthica (Weinberger et al. 2008), while A. vermiculophylla seems to be the preferred feed of the snail Littorina littorea relative to F. vesiculosus and F. serratus (C. Bommarito, GEOMAR, pers. comm.). If hypoxic upwelling in late summer leads to a decrease in crustacean mesograzer numbers (including Idotea spp.) and a proportional increase in gastropod mesograzers (including L. littorea), grazing pressure may shift from F. vesiculosus to A. vermiculophylla. This could partially compensate for the direct negative effect of (hypoxic) upwelling which strongly reduces recruitment of the bladder wrack (M. Wall GEOMAR, pers. comm.). Such a decline in recruitment could be the result of selection under multiple sequential drivers where the bladder wrack population selected under thermal stress exhibits enhanced sensitivity to hypoxia as was shown in a previous study (Al-Janabi et al. 2019).",False,False,False,
117,10.1002/lno.11954,28,True,"The tentative ranking of effect size and direction in Table 1 was intended to help compare the single and combined impacts of warming and upwelling in different phases over the summer. Warming outside the hottest phase of the year (mid-July to mid-August) was neutral or beneficial to most species of the community and tended to benefit more the macroalgae than their grazers or foulers. In the absence of experimental warming, all upwelling events had rather weak effects on macroalgae and were rather beneficial for grazers (except when hypoxic). The combination of warming and upwelling was predominantly stressful, except for foulers. Integrated over the entire summer and assuming intermittent recovery (i.e., mean of effects), warming without upwelling was slightly negative, upwelling without warming was neutral (macroalgae) to positive (grazers), but the combination of both was mostly negative. In contrast to this pattern, macrofoulers (mainly filamentous algae) benefitted from warming and upwelling and, particularly so, from their combination. Assuming carryover effects, the additive effects were strongest (Table 2).",False,True,False,
118,10.1002/lno.11954,29,True,"The observation that hypoxic upwelling generally turns particularly detrimental under warmed conditions represents a synergism. Thus, with progressive global change (warmer, wetter, more eutrophicated) the pressure on benthic communities will likely increase. More and more benthic habitats become transiently or permanently exposed to hypoxia (Diaz 2001;Breitburg et al. 2018;Fennel and Testa 2019). This development is particularly conspicuous in the Baltic Sea (Carstensen et al. 2014;Jokinen et al. 2018;Reusch et al. 2018). Most benthic organisms including microbes (Broman et al. 2017) are impacted by hypoxia (Diaz and Rosenberg 1995;Wu 2002), which results in community restructuring and biodiversity loss (Gammal et al. 2017). Species in fluctuating environments as is the Baltic Sea and particularly its shallow subtidal (Pansch et al. 2014;Reusch et al. 2018) may have evolved some degree of robustness towards environmental stress including hypoxia (Gedan et al. 2017), or to another potential stressor associated with hypoxic upwelling, that is, acidification (Thomsen and Melzner 2010). This may be due to selective mortality during phases of enhanced stress (Rilov et al. 2019) because fluctuations per se do not necessarily decrease the overall mean stress (Clark and Gobler 2016). Hypoxia, as do other stressful drivers, has the potential to inflict indirect effects such as shifts or disruptions of biotic interactions including grazing (Young and Gobler 2020). Equivalent to heat stress intensity commonly measured as degree heating days (or weeks) (Kayanne 2016), the severity of hypoxia stress should depend on the duration and distance to optimal oxygen concentration, that is, the integral of suboptimal conditions in time. With regard to the responses to thermal and hypoxia stress in the present investigation, one must also keep in mind that all species considered are of marine origin and, thus, performed under suboptimal osmotic, that is, brackish, conditions in this experiment. Independently of this, an absolute limit to marine life is suggested to be reached when a PO 2 of 1 kPa (ca 0.5 mg L À1 ) persists for an extended period (Seibel and Childress 2013).",False,False,False,

122,10.1002/lno.11954,33,True,"## Conclusions
The three ecologically most relevant abiotic parameters, temperature, salinity and oxygen, fluctuate in time and may reach stressful levels synchronously or sequentially. This leads to a stress regime that we have termed ""pulsed pressure."" Whether a stress is considered pulse or pressure depends on its duration relative to an organism's lifespan. Thus, in the brackish Western Baltic, chronically reduced salinity constitutes a pressure to all species of marine origin and a warm summer of several weeks may be experienced as pressure for short-lived gammarids and as pulsed by perennial seaweeds. Short excursions from benign conditions as happening during a few days of heat wave or hypoxic upwelling represents a stress pulse to most macroorganisms. In a fluctuating stress scenario, directional selection could be enhanced by mortality of sensitive genotypes during high stress (Vajedsamiei et al. 2021), and recovery or even reproduction of robust genotypes during low stress (Rilov et al. 2019). However, when sensitivities to different drivers reversely correlate, selection under one stressor may render the surviving population more sensitive to the second stressor (Al-Janabi et al. 2019). This underscores the importance to consider fluctuations and sequence of multiple drivers (Brooks and Crowe 2019).The present study highlights the complexity of coastal environments and the challenge of a pulsed pressure regime biota have to cope with. Therefore, not warming or hypoxia alone but rather the whole array of environmental drivers, and particularly their interplay in time and space, may determine community structural changes in the future ocean.## Conflict of interest

## Abstract
Stocks and fluxes of soil inorganic carbon have long been ignored in the context of coastal carbon sequestration, and their implications for the climate cooling effect of blue carbon ecosystems are complex. Here, we investigate the role of soil inorganic carbon in five salt marshes along the northern coast of the European Wadden Sea, one of the world's largest intertidal areas, harboring $ 20% of European salt-marsh area. We demonstrate a substantial contribution of inorganic carbon (average: 29%; range: 7-57%) to the total soil carbon stock of the top 1 m. Notably, inorganic exceeded organic carbon stocks in one of the studied sites; a finding that we ascribe to site geomorphic features, such as proximity to marine calcium carbonate sources and hydrodynamic exposure. Contrary to our hypothesis that inorganic carbon stocks would decline along the successional gradient from tidal flat to high marsh, as carbonate deposits would progressively dissolve in increasingly organic-rich rooted sediments, our findings demonstrate the opposite pattern-an increase in inorganic carbon stocks along the successional gradient. This suggests that the dissolution of calcium carbonates in the root zone is counterbalanced by other processes, such as trapping of sedimentary carbonates by marsh vegetation and calcium carbonate precipitation in anaerobic subsoils. In the context of blue carbon, it will be critical to develop an improved understanding of these plant-and microbiotamediated processes in calcium carbonate cycling.",False,False,False,

Blue carbon refers to the organic carbon cycled in vegetated coastal ecosystems, that is, tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows, which comprise the most effective long-term carbon sinks of the biosphere. Despite their small areal coverage of $ 1% of the global ocean surface, blue carbon ecosystems exert an extraordinary leverage over the global carbon cycle by accounting for $ 50% of the total marine soil (sediment) organic carbon budget (Duarte et al. 2013;Spivak et al. 2019). This role has stimulated great interest in their management as greenhouse gas offsets in carbon-crediting programs (Herr et al. 2017;Needelman et al. 2018). Carbon sequestration in these ecosystems is driven by the interplay of high rates of plant primary production, vertical soil development with rising sea levels, and slow rates of decomposition in reducing soils (Mcleod et al. 2011).",True,False,True,"According to the excerpt, the coastal ecosystems being studied are:

126,10.1002/lno.12322,2,True,"In recent years, a rapidly increasing number of studies refined our insight into soil organic carbon stocks and dynamics of tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrass beds (Macreadie et al. 2019;Rogers et al. 2019;Ren et al. 2022). By comparison, the stocks and fluxes of inorganic carbon have been largely ignored in the context of coastal carbon sequestration, and their implications for the climate cooling effect of these ecosystems remain unclear (Macreadie et al. 2017;Van Dam et al. 2021). The major part of soil inorganic carbon in blue carbon ecosystems derives from the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ), that is, the process of calcification (Saderne et al. 2019), but also dolomite (CaMg [CO 3 ] 2 ) dynamics could be relevant in some coastal regions (Gunatilaka 1991). Counterintuitively, calcification generates a net flux of CO 2 to the atmosphere, because for each mole of carbon fixed as calcium carbonate, two moles of total alkalinity are consumed, leading to a net increase in water-column pCO 2 (Macreadie et al. 2017). Conversely, the dissolution of calcium carbonates results in a net decrease of pCO 2 . In many cases, blue carbon ecosystems primarily act as depositional environments for allochthonous carbonates, which yields the potential for post-depositional dissolution (Macreadie et al. 2017). However, reports are almost restricted to seagrasses and mangroves, given the focus on inorganic carbon dynamics in tropical ecosystems, and there is a surprising lack of data on soil inorganic carbon stocks for tidal marshes. It is generally believed that inorganic carbon represents an unimportant contribution to tidal-marsh total carbon stocks, because rates of in situ calcification are usually negligible, and deposited calcium carbonate from allochthonous sources is assumed to rapidly dissolve under acidifying conditions of the marsh rhizosphere (Saderne et al. 2019).",False,False,False,
127,10.1002/lno.12322,3,True,"The salt marshes of the Wadden Sea represent 20% of the European tidal-marsh area (Doody 2008). These marshes are minerogenic ecosystems, characterized by high rates of mineral sediment deposition, resulting in vertical surface accretion frequently exceeding 5 mm yr À1 (Esselink et al. 2017). Previous work demonstrated that a large fraction of soil organic carbon preserved in these marshes is of sedimentary, allochthonous origin, which contributes $ 25% in the surface soil layer (0-5 cm) and $ 70% in the subsoil below 30 cm depth (Mueller et al. 2019a,b). Given the large fraction of allochthonous soil organic carbon, it is therefore possible that also sedimentary inorganic carbon imports play an important but so far overlooked role in the carbon budget of these ecosystems.Here, we investigated soil inorganic carbon stocks along the successional gradient from tidal flat (via pioneer zone and low marsh) to high marsh in two geomorphically contrasting tidal flat-salt marsh ecotones of the Wadden Sea: a foreland site and a back-barrier site. Foreland marshes in the Wadden Sea expand seaward from the main seawall and make up the largest share of the Wadden Sea marsh area. Foreland marshes are hydrodynamically exposed systems that experience high amounts of sediment input, particularly, during storm events in fall and winter. Back-barrier marshes are hydrodynamically more sheltered, as they develop in the lee of a barrier or dune system (Esselink et al. 2017). We first hypothesized that soil inorganic carbon stocks are greater at the foreland than at the backbarrier site, because sedimentary carbonate deposition would increase with hydrodynamic exposure and exchange with the marine system. We hypothesized second that soil inorganic carbon stocks would sharply decline along the successional gradient from tidal flat to high marsh, because carbonate deposits would progressively dissolve in increasingly rooted sediments. Finally, we investigated the soil inorganic carbon stocks of three additional high-marsh sites along the northern Wadden Sea coast in order to provide the first comprehensive estimate of soil inorganic carbon stocks for the region (Fig. 1).",False,False,False,

## Study sites and sampling: Coastal ecotones
The study was conducted along two geomorphically distinct tidal flat-salt marsh ecotones of the European Wadden Sea-the Skallingen site, Denmark, (a back-barrier site) and the Hamburger Hallig site (a foreland site), Germany (Fig. 1). At both sites, sampling was conducted along four zones of the successional gradient from tidal flat to high marsh (Fig. 2). In minerogenic salt marshes of the Wadden Sea, successional stages are typically reflected in a clear zonation of the plant community composition along an elevation gradient from tidal flat to high marsh (Castillo et al. 2021). In the Wadden Sea, the tidal flat is initially colonized by pioneer plant species, such as Salicornia sp. and Spartina anglica. Pioneer species are replaced by species from mid-and late-successional stages in the low and high marsh, such as Puccinellia maritima and Elymus athericus (Rupprecht et al. 2015). The pace of this process depends on the combination of drainage conditions and sedimentation rates in relation to flooding frequency (Leendertse et al. 1997;Olff et al. 1997).",False,False,False,

Soil pH (measured in CaCl 2 ) at the site ranges from 6.5 in the high marsh to 7.8 in the tidal flat (Supporting Information Fig. S1).

Marshes at Hamburger Hallig experience a tidal range of 3.4 m, with floodwater salinity ranging from 25 to 29 ppt. The vegetation shows a zonation typical for Wadden Sea salt marshes: Sp. anglica is dominant in the pioneer zone, A. portulacoides and Pu. maritima are dominant in the low marsh, and E. athericus is dominant in the high marsh (Esselink et al. 2017;Mueller et al. 2020).

Soil samples were dried at 105 C for at least 72 h and weighed to determine bulk density (sample dry weight divided by sample volume). Organic and inorganic carbon contents (% dry weight) of samples from the back-barrier and foreland ecotones were quantified by determining the total carbon content of acid-treated and untreated subsamples using elemental analyzers. Element analysis was coupled to isotope analysis to determine carbon stable-isotope ratios. We used a Costech ECS4010 elemental analyzer coupled to a Picarro G2121-i isotope analyzer at Bryn Mawr College or an Eurovector EURO-EA 3000 elemental analyzer coupled to a Nu Instruments Nu Horizon isotope ratio mass spectrometer at Hamburg University. Approximately 100-300 mg of subsample was acidified in 1-mL glass vials using 0.1-0.4 mL (depending on reaction strength) of 10% HCl. Acidified subsamples were vented for 12 h at room temperature under a fume hood and subsequently dried at 105 C to constant weight. The carbon content of acidtreated subsamples, accounting for changes in sample mass caused by HCl addition, was considered as organic carbon content. Inorganic carbon contents were calculated subtracting organic carbon contents from total carbon contents of untreated subsamples.

Data were analyzed using Statistica (TIBCO Software Inc.) and Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation).

Before using calculated inorganic carbon contents > 0% in further statistical analyses, we checked for 13 C depletion in acidified vs. un-acidified samples. Inorganic carbon contents of samples that did not show 13 C depletion upon acidification were likewise considered as 0% soil inorganic carbon. This data-quality check was conducted to avoid overestimation of inorganic carbon contents and stocks. Soil inorganic and organic carbon stock or density (= carbon mass/soil volume) was calculated by multiplying sample bulk density (= soil dry mass/soil volume) with inorganic and organic carbon contents (mass %), respectively. Carbon-stock and carbon-content data for the entire 100-cm soil profile were calculated by linear interpolation between the four depth sections (i.e., 0-10, 20-30, 60-70, and 90-100 cm) for the soil cores that were only sampled at those four discrete depths. The validity of this assessment was verified by comparing mean soil inorganic carbon contents of the top 100-cm soil layer based on values from linear interpolation with values from higher resolution sampling (i.e., 10 cm increments) in n = 8 cores. A paired t-test did not indicate significant differences between interpolated and higher-resolution data (p = 0.86). Two-way ANOVA was used to test if organic and inorganic carbon stocks differ between sites (back-barrier vs. foreland; Hypothesis 1) and successional zone (tidal flat vs. pioneer zone vs. low marsh vs. high marsh; Hypothesis 2). Prior ANOVA testing, we visually checked for normal distribution of residuals and homogeneity of variances across groups. Due to the fully balanced study design, potential moderate deviations from homogeneity of variance between groups were considered unimportant for ANOVA testing (Box 1954;McGuinness 2002).

The effect of zone was significant based on two-way ANOVA (Table 1).Soil inorganic carbon stocks were significantly greater than soil organic carbon stocks at the foreland site (paired t-test: p < 0.01), whereas the opposite was true for the back-barrier site (p < 0.001; Fig. 2).Soil organic carbon contents and stocks of the top 1 m showed a clearer increase along the successional gradient than inorganic carbon contents and stocks (Fig. 2; Table 1). Site effects on soil organic carbon differed markedly from the inorganic carbon results. While organic carbon contents were significantly greater at the back-barrier than foreland site, there was no difference in organic carbon stocks between sites (Fig. 2; Table 1).Expanding the comparison of soil inorganic vs. organic carbon stocks to a larger number of high-marsh sites along the northern Wadden Sea coast (Fig. 1B) revealed that   greater inorganic vs. organic carbon stocks represent an exception (Fig. 3). Overall, mean soil organic carbon stocks of the top 1 m were > 100% greater than inorganic carbon stocks; although this difference was only marginally significant due to high variability in inorganic carbon stocks across sites (Fig. 3).",False,True,False,

## Soil inorganic carbon stocks of Wadden Sea salt marshes
The present survey including five salt-marsh sites along the northern Wadden Sea coast reveals a soil inorganic carbon stock for the top 1 m of soil of 75 Mg ha À1 (range: 17-188), which represents a substantial contribution of inorganic carbon to the total soil carbon stock of these ecosystems (29%; range: 7-57%). Notably, one of the sites supported even greater soil inorganic than organic carbon stocks (Fig. 3). Our observed inorganic carbon densities, median = 4 mg cm À3 (IQR = 5 mg cm À3 ), are comparable to global median (and IQR) values reported for mangroves of 1 (21) mg cm À3 but are lower than those reported for seagrass beds, 59 (66) mg cm À3 , as reported in the first meta-analysis on carbonate dynamics in blue carbon ecosystems (Saderne et al. 2019). There are few studies reporting soil inorganic carbon contents for tidalmarsh ecosystems (Vranken et al. 1990;Zwolsman et al. 1993;Spohn et al. 2013;Saderne et al. 2019), and even fewer providing soil inorganic carbon stock (or density) data for tidal marshes that could be used to compare our findings with. Specifically, Saderne et al. (2018) reported extreme mean soil inorganic carbon stocks of 970 Mg ha À1 for marsh-related sabkha ecosystems of the Arabian Peninsula, and Zhang et al. (2021) report mean soil inorganic carbon stocks of $ 150 Mg ha À1 for a minerogenic estuarine salt marsh on the Yellow River Delta, a finding that falls well within the range reported here.",False,False,True,
137,10.1002/lno.12322,13,True,"Our findings of large inorganic carbon stocks challenge the prevailing notion that tidal marshes are unimportant inorganic carbon stores compared to other blue carbon ecosystems, that is, mangroves and seagrass beds (Saderne et al. 2019). Tidal marshes have an exceptionally high potential for calcium carbonate dissolution in soils (Vranken et al. 1990) and a relatively low abundance of calcifying organisms (Saderne et al. 2019). We do not have any data to suggest the opposite for the salt marshes of the Wadden Sea. Instead, we argue that calcium carbonate accumulation represents an inherently large, but overlooked feature of many minerogenic tidal-marsh ecosystems. Vertical soil development in minerogenic marshes is primarily driven by high rates of mineral sediment deposition (Allen 2000); and thus, calcium carbonate inputs can be substantial, depending on site geomorphology, proximity of marine or riverine carbonate sources, and the carbonate concentration of suspended sediments (Allen 1987;Larsonneur 1994).",False,False,False,
138,10.1002/lno.12322,14,True,"## Inorganic vs. organic carbon stock development
Our data suggest that geomorphic setting acts an important predictor of marsh soil inorganic carbon stocks, as it controls the frequency and amount of carbonate deposition. Specifically, we found soil inorganic carbon stocks were much greater in the foreland ecotone at Hamburger Hallig than in the backbarrier ecotone at Skallingen, which supports our first hypothesis that inorganic carbon accumulation is more pronounced at hydrodynamically exposed sites, with high marine exchange, than at sites that are hydrodynamically more sheltered with lower marine exchange (Fig. 2). Greater marine exchange at the foreland than back-barrier site is further supported by the δ 13 C signature of organic carbon accumulating in the surface soil of the high marsh (Supporting Information Fig. S1). These 13 C-enriched signatures at the foreland site indicate a larger relative contribution of marine-derived organic carbon to the total organic carbon pool (Mueller et al. 2020). In contrast to the inorganic carbon results, soil organic carbon stocks did not significantly differ between sites (Fig. 2; Table 1). This finding is in accordance with previous work in the region demonstrating relatively constrained soil organic carbon densities for whole-soil profiles (i.e., ≥ 100 cm depth) across Wadden Sea salt marshes, independent of site geomorphology (Mueller et al. 2019b). Despite similar average sitelevel organic carbon stocks, the two sites showed markedly different organic-carbon trends along the successional gradient from tidal flat to high marsh (Table 1). Specifically, tidalflat and pioneer-zone organic carbon stocks tended to be lower at the back-barrier than the foreland site; whereas the opposite is true for the low and high marsh (Fig. 2). We argue that this pattern is caused by a more extreme distribution of sand contents at the back-barrier site ranging from > 99% sand in some sediment layers of the tidal flat to < 1% sand in the high marsh. Sand content at the foreland site show far less variability across soil depths and zones and consequently less variability in organic carbon contents and stocks (Fig. 5). We argue that this distribution results from the greater hydrodynamic exposition of the foreland site, allowing for greater deposition of large grains at high elevations (Allen 1992(Allen , 2000;;Müller-Navarra et al. 2016).",False,True,True,
139,10.1002/lno.12322,15,True,"Our data demonstrate an unexpected increase in inorganic carbon stocks along the successional gradient with stocks maximized in the low or high marsh. These patterns of inorganic carbon stocks along successional gradients were relatively consistent between sites (Table 1; Fig. 2). We originally hypothesized inorganic carbon stocks to decline along this gradient as calcium carbonate deposits would progressively dissolve in increasingly rooted sediments. Although our findings do not exclude an increase in carbonate dissolution rates along the successional gradient, they do suggest that any potential increase in carbonate dissolution gets overcompensated by other plant-mediated and microbially mediated processes, such as trapping of sedimentary carbonates by marsh vegetation and calcium carbonate precipitation in anaerobic subsoils.",False,True,False,
140,10.1002/lno.12322,16,True,"It is well established that plants effectively trap sediment from the water column and thereby increase mineral sediment deposition compared to unvegetated areas (Morris et al. 2002;Kirwan and Megonigal 2013). Therefore, plant-mediated carbonate deposition likely contributed to greater inorganic carbon stocks in marsh vs. tidal-flat soils (Fig. 6). Precipitation of calcium carbonates below the acidifying conditions of the rhizosphere could act as an additional driver of high inorganic carbon stocks in marsh soils in relation to the tidal flat (Vranken et al. 1990). This process can be mediated by the production of bicarbonate ions and the consumption of protons by anaerobic microbial communities. For instance, Rassmann et al. ( 2016) demonstrated a strong association of calcium carbonate precipitation with anaerobic microbial metabolism in the sediments of the Rhône delta. Anaerobic metabolism, and thus carbonate precipitation, increased with sediment organic matter contents and decreasing distance to the delta. Similarly, increasing organic matter availability along the gradient from tidal flat to high marsh could support greater rates of anaerobic microbial metabolism and coupled carbonate precipitation in the present study.

141,10.1002/lno.12322,17,True,"The soil profiles investigated at the foreland site revealed an additional important contributor to larger inorganic carbon stocks in marsh vs. tidal-flat soils. Here, a large fraction of the inorganic carbon stock was found in deeper layers of extremely high inorganic carbon density, largely composed of comminuted shell debris (Figs. 1C,D, 4). These shell deposits could result from storm surges translocating shell fragments from unvegetated intertidal and subtidal environments to the salt marsh, were they get trapped by the vegetation (Allen 1987). Furthermore, we found evidence that shell accumulation might reflect a phase of the early marsh development. Specifically, we observed large amounts of shell debris accumulating in pockets and gullies of the mash-edge cliff, where they are being overgrown by secondary pioneer vegetation (Fig. 1C). The formation of marsh cliffs through edge erosion and regrowth of marsh in front of the cliff are intrinsic processes of natural salt-marsh dynamics (van de Koppel et al. 2005). At the foreland site, marsh cliffs provide an effective deposition environment for large amounts of shell debris. The phenomenon of cliff-fringing shell deposits is not specific to our study site at Hamburger Hallig, or salt marshes of the Wadden Sea region, but has been reported for other coastal environments worldwide, such as the Jiangsu Coast, China (Zhao et al. 2017) and San Francisco Bay, California (Baye et al. 2020). Therefore, it is possible that the cyclical process of marsh-cliff erosion and regrowth could represent an important driver of inorganic carbon accumulation in coastal ecotones that warrants further investigation.Changes in inorganic carbon content with soil depth should be interpreted cautiously, especially in the context of carbonate dynamics, where the inorganic-carbon change with depth may reflect succession in young marsh ecosystems. Declining inorganic carbon contents with soil depth have previously been interpreted as evidence of postdepositional carbonate dissolution (Vranken et al. 1990;Zhang et al. 2021).",False,False,False,

We currently know little about the importance of different pedogenic and biogenic calcium carbonate sources feeding tidal marsh inorganic carbon stocks. The present study provides evidence that the deposition of shell debris, derived from adjacent marine ecosystems, can be one important carbonate input to marsh ecosystems. If this finding applies more widely to other coastal regions, it may yield important implications for CO 2 and alkalinity budgets at the landscape scale of the coastal zone (i.e., the coastal seascape). A growing number of reports suggests that interactions between spatially associated coastal ecosystems via long-distance facilitative processes can enhance the blue carbon potential of the seascape (Huxham et al. 2018;Ren et al. 2022). Similarly, connectivity of coastal ecosystems may also represent an important factor determining calcium carbonate dynamics and thus the alkalinity budget at the seascape scale. That is, calcium carbonate can be translocated or eroded from calcifying ecosystems, such as corals or bivalve reefs, and deposited and dissolved in tidal-marsh ecosystems (Fig. 6). In this way, alkalinity consumption in calcifying ecosystems may be counterbalanced by alkalinity production in ecosystems that support greater rates of carbonate dissolution. The exchange of calcium carbonate between ecosystems within the coastal seascape has yet poorly been explored (Saderne et al. 2019), and new methodological approaches that facilitate tracing carbon fluxes within the coastal seascape will be needed to develop a quantitative understanding of these fluxes.",False,False,False,
144,10.1002/lno.12322,20,True,"Plants are likely to control two key processes of the tidalmarsh calcium carbonate balance. First, aboveground plant structures effectively trap sediment from the water column and thus, determine the rate of allochthonous calcium carbonate input to the ecosystem. Second, plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere yield a high potential to facilitate or accelerate carbonate dissolution. Plant roots stimulate soil microbial activity by supplying oxygen to an otherwise anoxic soil environment via root oxygen loss and by releasing labile organic substrates via rhizodeposition, thereby exerting primary control over soil organic carbon cycling (Mueller et al. 2016;Spivak et al. 2019;Ren et al. 2022;Bernal et al. 2023). The same plant-microbe interactions can also lead to a strong acidification of the rhizosphere, driven by rising soil CO 2 levels and the reoxidation of reduced metabolites (Ku et al. 1999;Koop-Jakobsen et al. 2018), which likely facilitates or accelerates carbonate dissolution (Burdige and Zimmerman 2002;Fig. 6). However, experimental support for this potentially important link between plantmicrobe interactions and calcium carbonate dissolution in coastal ecosystems is yet lacking. New methodological approaches in the field of wetland rhizosphere research are needed to close this important knowledge gap in our understanding of coastal carbonate dynamics. Recent developments in the field of rhizosphere imaging, such as planar optode imaging of rhizosphere O 2 , CO 2 , and pH dynamics (Koop-Jakobsen et al. 2018, 2021), appear promising to advance our mechanistic and quantitative understanding in this context.",False,False,False,

The potentially important role of sedimentary carbonate dissolution in marsh soils as a source of alkalinity to coastal waters has never been investigated, probably because past studies have been conducted in sediment poor, organogenic ecosystems with negligible calcium carbonate inputs.

Our study demonstrated that inorganic carbon can represent an important fraction of the total soil carbon stock in minerogenic salt marshes, and that these ecosystems can act as important depositional environments for inorganic carbon. This observation highlights the need to develop a deeper mechanistic and quantitative understanding of inorganic carbon fluxes in minerogenic salt marshes as well as between marshes and adjacent marine ecosystems within the coastal seascape (Fig. 6). For the interpretation of soil inorganic carbon in the context of blue carbon and, more specifically, the climate change-mitigation capacity of tidal marshes, it is critical to develop an improved understanding of calcium carbonate fluxes rather than stocks. Overall, we know little about the quantitative importance of different potential pedogenic and biogenic carbonate sources feeding salt marsh inorganic carbon stocks, rates of carbonate dissolution and reprecipitation in soils, and the contribution of carbonate dissolution to alkalinity export from coastal ecosystems (Fig. 6).### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1.

## Abstract
On Caribbean coral reefs, sponges are important members of the benthic community and have an important role in consuming particulate organic matter (POM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM), with the subsequent production of detritus that is then shunted into a process now referred to as the ""sponge-loop."" An emergent species of sponge commonly found on Caribbean coral reefs, Agelas tubulata, increases in size and growth rate from shallow (< 30 m) to mesophotic depths (30-150 m) on Grand Cayman Island. A. tubulata depends largely on heterotrophy across shallow to mesophotic depths and has been shown to utilize detritus on shallow reefs. However, detritus production by A. tubulata on shallow and mesophotic coral reefs has not been previously reported. Here we show, using flow cytometry, that sponge detritus includes a previously unquantified component, phytodetritus. Sponge phytodetritus production was shown experimentally to be greater in sponges from mesophotic depths compared to sponges from shallow coral reefs. Additionally, the size range of this phytodetritus corresponds to the size range of autotrophic picoplankton, primarily prochlorophytes, known to be an important food source for filter-feeding sponges. Given the known lability of phytodetritus, compared to other more recalcitrant components of the detrital pool, its role in the food web of mesophotic communities combined with the increased availability of live POM, may be an underappreciated component of mesophotic community carbon and nitrogen flow.",False,False,False,

Detritus and detrital food webs, are a defining characteristic of many coastal marine ecosystems (Moore et al. 2004;Lopez and Levinton 2011). The amount of carbon and energy flowing through detrital pathways can exceed herbivory and support highly diverse communities (Moore et al. 2004), with the nutritional value (i.e., C : N ratios) and bioavailability of detritus largely dependent on the source and ""conditioning"" of detritus by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms (Lopez and Levinton 2011). Detritus in the open ocean is primarily composed of senescent phytoplankton, or fecal pellets from pelagic grazers such as copepods (Lopez and Levinton 2011). It is now understood that oceanic detritus also contains large numbers of picoplankton within organic aggregations (Waite et al. 2000). The detritus pool of coastal marine ecosystems, including coral reefs, is also composed of more refractory components such as degrading macroalgae, sea grass, and terrestrial plant litter (Lopez and Levinton 2011;Lønborg et al. 2018). Within the detritus pool, the degrading photoautotrophic components are known as phytodetritus. Phytodetritus has higher nutritional value when compared to the recalcitrant components of the detrital pool, can be further conditioned by microorganisms, and it is assimilated rapidly and more efficiently (i.e., is more labile or bioavailable) by a wide range of suspension and deposit feeders once it reaches marine benthic communities (Lopez and Levinton 2011).",False,False,False,
161,10.1002/lno.12342,2,True,"On coral reefs the production of organic material, particularly carbon, has long been believed to be highly conserved and tightly recycled within a community (Hatcher 1988(Hatcher , 1990)). Multiple benthic primary producers (e.g., corals, seagrasses, turf algae, coralline algae and macrophytes) release large amounts of fixed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) onto coral reefs (Alldredge et al. 2013;Mueller et al. 2014). These sources add to an already large pool of DOC (> 50%) from the phytoplankton community in the overlying water column released through exudation, viral lysis, and herbivory (Becker et al. 2014;Thorton 2014). Both dissolved organic matter (DOM) and particulate organic matter (POM) are then utilized by benthic and pelagic microbial communities in pathways such as the microbial loop supporting large concentrations of microbial biomass (Azam et al. 1983). This microbial biomass, both autotrophs and heterotrophs, is then grazed upon by benthic suspension feeders such as sponges (e.g., Lesser 2006) where they contribute to the energy and organic carbon flow on coral reefs (Silveira et al. 2017), as well as supporting significant amounts of benthic secondary production (Gili andComa 1998, de Goeij et al. 2017).",False,False,True,
162,10.1002/lno.12342,3,True,"On coral reefs sponges generally increase in abundance and biodiversity with increasing depth from shallow to mesophotic depths (Slattery and Lesser 2012;Lesser and Slattery 2018;Lesser et al. 2018) where they have multiple functional roles including the coupling of DOM and POM in the overlying water to the benthos (Lesser andSlattery 2013, 2018;de Goeij et al. 2017). Sponge communities on oligotrophic tropical coral reefs are structured by depthdependent changes in environmental parameters such as irradiance, competitive interactions for space, and the availability of trophic resources (Lesser et al. 2018(Lesser et al. , 2019;;Slattery and Lesser 2021). As depth increases, live POM increases while DOM decreases (Lesser et al. 2019(Lesser et al. , 2020)). Importantly, on coral reefs the particulate organic nitrogen (PON) fraction of the POM pool increases both in absolute terms, and as a proportion of the total organic nitrogen pool with increasing depth (Lesser et al. 2020). As depth increases sponge consumption of POM, specifically picoplankton with its lower C : N ratio, increases and is associated with increasing sponge biomass and growth rates (Macartney et al. 2021a(Macartney et al. , 2022)). The increases in sponge biomass and growth appear to be supported by increasing tissue protein concentrations in Agelas tubulata, and other sponges, with increasing depth (Macartney et al. 2022). This indicates that mesophotic sponges have a net positive balance between protein synthesis and degradation which is common in faster growing animals (Fraser and Rogers 2007). This also suggests increasing energetic efficiencies in protein synthesis for these sponges as depth increases. Conservatively, over long ecological timeframes an approximately five-fold increase in the percentage of PON in the total organic nitrogen pool results in a modest increase in PON consumption for sponges, $ 1% from 22 to 91 m, and appears to be important for the support of sponge biomass and growth at mesophotic depths (Macartney et al. 2021a).",False,False,False,
163,10.1002/lno.12342,4,True,"Sponges, both high and low microbial abundance symbiotic states, known as HMA and LMA phenotypes, respectively, in the sponge biology literature (Hentschel et al. 2006), also consume DOM with the rates of uptake and assimilation greater in high microbial abundance sponges compared to low microbial abundance sponges (Hoer et al. 2018;McMurray et al. 2018). Rates of pumping, choanocyte chamber densities and POM uptake and assimilation, however, are commonly higher in low microbial abundance sponges when assessed directly or when using stable isotopic analyses (Weisz et al. 2008;Maldonado et al. 2012;Poppell et al. 2014;McMurray et al. 2018;Rix et al. 2020;Macartney et al. 2021aMacartney et al. ,b, 2022;;Lesser et al. 2022) with some low microbial abundance sponge species apparently not utilizing DOM at all (de Goeij et al. 2017;Hoer et al. 2018;McMurray et al. 2018). In high microbial abundance sponges the majority of DOM uptake is driven by their microbiomes as host DOM uptake is equivalent between high microbial abundance and low microbial abundance sponges (Rix et al. 2020). DOM can then be reprocessed and the byproducts of their metabolism (e.g., dissolved free amino acids) translocated to the host (Shih et al. 2020;Macartney et al. 2021b). Additionally, the consumption of POM or DOM by sponges can lead to the production of detritus (Maldonado 2016). This ""sponge"" detritus is composed of senescent choanocytes and other sponge cells (de Goeij et al. 2013;Alexander et al. 2014) ranging in size from 2 to 10 μm (Leys and Hill 2012;Maldonado 2016), and fuels a benthic detrital pathway (i.e., the ""sponge loop"") that conserves organic carbon within oligotrophic coral reef ecosystems (de Goeij et al. 2013(de Goeij et al. , 2017;;Rix et al. 2018).",False,False,False,

A common sponge species on Caribbean coral reefs, A. tubulata, was utilized in this study.While it has recently been shown that this species represents two phenotypic morphotypes that are genetically indistinguishable (i.e., A. conifera and A. tubulata; Pankey et al. 2022), the morphotype used here was the tube form (Fig. 1) and will therefore be referred to here as A. tubulata.",False,False,False,

The effect size is characterized as medium (R 2 = 0.25) to large (R 2 = 0.64) for the relationship between depth and ambient concentrations of phytodetritus.

The weighted fluxes of phytodetritus production were then analyzed using an ANOVA with experimental treatment as the fixed factor. All experimental samples of A. tubulata exhibited a net efflux of phytodetritus particles.

171,10.1002/lno.12342,12,True,"## Discussion
On coral reefs sponges generally increase in density and cover with depth, including populations of A. tubulata, into the mesophotic zone (Slattery and Lesser 2012;Lesser and Slattery 2013;Lesser et al. 2018;Macartney et al. 2021b). Here, we have shown that A. tubulata also increases in size (i.e., length) as depth increases into the lower mesophotic. It has been shown that increased consumption of picoplankton with low C : N ratios provides an important resource of nitrogen for growth in active suspension feeders such as sponges (Ribes et al. 2003(Ribes et al. , 2005)). Combined with the fact that sponges have never been shown to be carbon limited (Lesser et al. 2018(Lesser et al. , 2020)), the increasing availability and assimilation of picoplankton with increasing depth may be an essential component of the nitrogen requirements to support the growth and biomass of sponges at mesophotic depths (Lesser et al. 2018). Additionally, changes in size with depth identify a key aspect of the trophic biology of sponges; the requirement to remove the confounding effects of size (i.e., allometry) on measurements of DOM and POM uptake, as well as the production of detritus (Lesser 2006;Morganti et al. 2019;Macartney et al. 2021a).",False,False,False,
172,10.1002/lno.12342,13,True,"The importance of the sponge loop and its effects on carbon, nitrogen, and energy flow on coral reefs, should also be dependent on the quantity and composition of detritus produced by sponges. For those studies that have evaluated the nutritional quality of sponge detritus (Lesser et al. 2020;Kornder et al. 2022) the C : N values have been low (< 10) indicating the availability of high quality organic material to participate in the sponge loop. Since the sponge loop hypothesis was proposed it has been shown that both high microbial abundance and low microbial abundance sponges produce detritus, that detritus composition can be species specific, and that choanocytes may not be a component of detritus in all sponges (Maldonado 2016). While encrusting sponges have been reported to produce significant amounts of detritus (de Goeij et al. 2017), many species of emergent sponges on coral reefs appear to produce little, if any, detritus including A. tubulata (e.g., McMurray et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
173,10.1002/lno.12342,14,True,"A conspicuous component of detritus production in many sponges is the multiple cell types containing phagocytosed bacteria, while all appear to shed degraded cellular material and mucus (Alexander et al. 2014;Maldonado 2016;Kornder et al. 2022). These cell types include choanocytes, archeocytes, spherulous cells, granular cells, and exocytosed vesicles (Alexander et al. 2014;Maldonado 2016). Bulk sponge detritus production has been quantified on encrusting sponges from shallow and mesophotic depths (e.g., Lesser et al. 2020) but coral reef sponges can consume, as well as produce, detritus (Hadas et al. 2009;McMurray et al. 2018, Lesser et al. 2020), such that the net fluxes of detritus, in addition to live POM and DOM, would need to be assessed. This would require reconciling detritus production as originally described in the excurrent water of sponges using closed incubations (de Goeij et al. 2013), open pots (Alexander et al. 2014), the funnel method (Lesser et al. 2020), and the release of detritus from the incurrent canals of ostia, so called ""sponge sneezing"" (Kornder et al. 2022). The analysis of phytodetritus by flow cytometry as described here should also be included and given the variability in detritus sources and methods of measurements more than one approach may be required for studying sponge detritus. While flow cytometry remains the best method to quantify the use of live POM by sponges (Yahel et al. 2003;Lesser 2006), flow cytometry has previously been used only for the detection of sponge detritus, but not for the calculation of fluxes in sponges (Yahal et al. 2003;McMurray et al. 2016), and to the best of our knowledge not for quantifying phytodetritus. Because the cellular components of detritus are generally < 10 μm in size (Leys andHill 2012, Maldonado 2016), flow cytometry should be more fully evaluated as an approach to quantify the smaller sized constituents of sponge detritus, especially if they have characteristic fluorescence signatures as is the case for phytodetritus. Here, most of the gated particles (> 2.0 μm) counted as phytodetritus are larger than commonly consumed picoautotrophs (0.2-2.0 μm) suggesting that aggregates of organic material (i.e., mucus) and degraded picoplankton may be a large portion of the phytodetritus measured here. This does not eliminate the possibility that choanocytes ($ 2-10 μm) with phagocytized bacteria are also components of this sponge phytodetritus.",False,False,False,
174,10.1002/lno.12342,15,True,"For this reef system the concentration of naturally occurring phytodetritus, as defined here, decreases with increasing depth and is almost four orders of magnitude less than what is produced by A. tubulata at any depth. The decrease in phytodetritus concentration with increasing depth could be a function of continued degradation and loss of fluorescence, or consumption by various grazers. For sponges, the consumption of DOM results in detritus production (de Goeij et al. 2013(de Goeij et al. , 2017)), as does the consumption of POM (Maldonado 2016). The concentration of picoautotrophs, especially prochlorophytes, on Caribbean coral reefs increases with increasing depth (Lesser 2006;Lesser et al. 2019Lesser et al. , 2020) ) as do picoheterotrophic bacterial communities providing more live POM (Lesser 2006;Lesser et al. 2019;Macartney et al. 2021a). As a result, because sponges consume picoplankton in proportion to its abundance more live POM is consumed by sponges (Lesser 2006;Macartney et al. 2021a) as depth increases. Combined with DOM uptake it would be reasonable to predict an increase in the production of phyodetritus from the consumption of picoplankton with increasing depth. The results of the transplant experiment support this prediction with greater phytodetritus production at deeper, compared to shallow, depths. Importantly, the results of phytodetritus production from the shallow to deep and deep to shallow transplants also reflect the amount of food, specifically POM, available for sponges as their rates of feeding and phytodetritus production are intermediate between deep and shallow sponges.",False,False,False,
175,10.1002/lno.12342,16,True,"Detritus production in mesophotic sponges has not been well studied. However, a previous study of shallow (< 30 m) and upper mesophotic (30-60 m) samples of the encrusting sponge, Halisarca caerulea, a low microbial abundance sponge, showed that detritus production was significantly lower in sponges from mesophotic depths compared to shallow conspecifics (Lesser et al. 2020). This is the opposite pattern described here for A. tubulata, a high microbial abundance sponge. H. caerulea has been one of the archetypical, encrusting, species used in experiments describing the sponge loop (e.g., de Goeij et al. 2013de Goeij et al. , 2017) ) with morphology (i.e., surface to volume ratios) considered to be an important factor related to detritus production in encrusting vs. massive sponges (de Goeij et al. 2017, Kornder et al. 2022). In the Red Sea, for example, the sponge Xestospongia testudinaria, a massive barrel sponge, does not appear to produce any detritus (Wooster et al. 2019), like several massive sponges in the Caribbean (McMurray et al. 2018). Here, the issues of functional morphology and trophic resource abundances intersect and require studies on detritus production in encrusting and massive sponge species across the shallow to mesophotic depth gradient.",False,False,False,

The results are consistent with the consumption of large amounts of pigment containing picoautotrophs that have either been degraded during the digestive process or were phagocytosed and are within the host cells that are known to make-up sponge detritus (Maldonado 2016). It is also possible that in addition to the recently reported release of detritus through the ostia of sponges (Kornder et al. 2022), that the source of the phytodetritus reported here is from ostia on the inner wall of the tube in A. tubulata. This report of significant amounts of phytodetritus produced by sponges reveals another understudied and underappreciated component of sponge detritus. Providing that sponge phytodetritus is more labile and bioavailable than the more recalcitrant components of detritus (Lopez and Levinton 2011), it may be an important source of both carbon and nitrogen for many suspension feeders and detritivores on tropical coral reefs including dense populations of sponges at mesophotic depths.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Western Lake Erie cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) occur every summer as a result of anthropogenic nutrient loading. Although the physiological importance of nitrogen (N) in supporting bloom biomass and toxin production is established, the role of internal N recycling in the water column to support bloom maintenance is not as well understood. Over three field seasons (2015-2017), we collected water from western Lake Erie and employed bottle incubations with 15 N-ammonium (NH þ 4 ) enrichments to determine NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates in the water column. Potential NH þ 4 uptake rates followed spatial and seasonal patterns, with greatest rates measured nearest the Maumee River inflow and during peak bloom months (August and September). Regeneration followed a similar spatial pattern but was greatest in early summer (June and July) and supported $ 20-60% of potential NH þ 4 demand during the height of the bloom. Basinwide internal NH þ 4 regeneration during the April-October period could supply NH þ 4 at 60-200% of annual external N loading to the western basin. These results help explain how non-N-fixing cyanoHABs in Lake Erie and other large, eutrophic lakes continue producing biomass and N-rich toxins long after spring nutrient loads are exhausted or transported to other areas. Internal N loads are ultimately driven by external N loads; in low precipitation years, external nutrient loads result in smaller blooms, producing less substrate for subsequent internal N loads. Overall, these findings, along with others, confirm that both internal and external N loading must be considered when evaluating cyanoHAB management strategies.",False,False,False,

Microcystis-dominated cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in western Lake Erie have increased in severity since the mid-1990s (Steffen et al. 2014). Research on and management of high nutrient loads from agricultural watersheds have focused on phosphorus (P) as the key driver of cyanoHABs in Lake Erie (Martin et al. 2021) and globally (Paerl et al. 2016). Although total P and total nitrogen (TN) loads have decreased in recent decades, the proportion of dissolved reactive P in the total P load to Lake Erie has increased and correlates with annual bloom size (Jarvie et al. 2017, but see River and Richardson 2019). Likewise, the fraction of the TN load comprised of chemically reduced N forms (as total Kjeldahl N [TKN]) delivered to western Lake Erie has increased concurrently and is also related to cyanoHAB biomass (Newell et al. 2019).",False,False,False,
182,10.1002/lno.12185,2,True,"Uncertainties in dissolved reactive P analyses related to nanoparticulate P passing through 0.45-μm filters may result in over-estimation of Maumee River fluxes to western Lake Erie by $ 50% (River and Richardson 2019). The temporal disconnect, exceeding the basin residence time, between spring dissolved reactive P loads and cyanoHABs in late summer is also problematic (Newell et al. 2019). In contrast, higher TKN (including highly bioavailable ammonium [NH þ  4 ] and urea) proportions in the Maumee River TN load in mid-summer coincide well with cyanoHAB initiation in July (Newell et al. 2019). Cyanobacteria, particularly non-N fixing taxa, are excellent at scavenging NH þ 4 and often outcompete eukaryotic organisms (e.g., diatoms) for NH þ 4 (Blomqvist et al. 1994). Microcystis and many other toxin-producing, bloom-forming taxa (e.g., Planktothrix) cannot fix atmospheric dinitrogen (N 2 ) and thus rely on combined N, particularly NH þ 4 , in the water column (Paerl et al. 2016). Maximum uptake rates (V max ) for NH þ 4 are 4-6 times greater than those for nitrate (NO À 3 ) in Microcystis (Takamura et al. 1987), while diatoms are often more competitive for NO À 3 (Glibert et al. 2016). Microcystin concentrations and biomass of non-N fixing cyanobacteria increase in response to NH þ 4 additions (Chaffin et al. 2018), and NH þ 4 and urea induce upregulation of microcystin-associated genes (Harke et al. 2016) more quickly than NO À 3 (Chaffin et al. 2018). Conversely, low NH þ 4 concentrations inhibit toxin production due to ntcA (global cyanobacteria N regulation gene) activation, the product of which binds to the mcy gene cassette responsible for microcystin production and represses its activity (Kuniyoshi et al. 2011). NH þ 4 bioreactivity leads to rapid assimilation and recycling within the sediments and water column, making it difficult to accurately characterize in situ NH þ 4 concentrations (McCarthy et al. 2013). Thus, snapshot sampling and monitoring efforts for NH þ 4 concentrations cannot accurately estimate NH þ 4 availability in situ, which requires measuring NH þ 4 assimilation and turnover/recycling rates (Gardner et al. 2017).",False,False,False,
183,10.1002/lno.12185,3,True,"Over three field seasons (April through October, 2015-2017), NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates were quantified in the western Lake Erie water column to evaluate the importance of internal N loading in supporting non-N-fixing cyanoHAB biomass and toxin production. Potential NH þ 4 uptake includes both assimilation into primary producer biomass and nitrification (conversion of NH þ 4 to NO À 3 ). NH þ 4 regeneration includes, but is not limited to, remineralization of organic compounds, microplankton excretions (including algal exudation), and sloppy feeding by grazers (Hopkinson et al. 1987). We also evaluated the capacity of NH þ 4 regeneration to support water column NH þ 4 demand across the bloom season relative to external TN loading.We expected that NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates would follow patterns described previously (i.e., photic exceeding dark NH þ 4 uptake, highest NH þ 4 uptake during peak blooms, potential NH þ 4 uptake exceeding regeneration) and follow spatial and temporal trends consistent with seasonality and distance from nutrient sources. Specifically, we hypothesized that: (1) both NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates would decrease with distance from the Maumee River mouth; (2) both NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates would increase from late spring/early summer to August and September (peak bloom); and (3) rates measured in nearsurface waters would be greater than those from near-bottom waters. We anticipated that the proportion of internal NH þ 4 regeneration capable of supporting potential NH þ 4 uptake would increase from bloom initiation to bloom peak. Given the importance of NH þ 4 to the metabolic demands of cyano-HABs and the difficulty of accurately determining in situ NH þ 4 concentrations, quantifying these NH þ 4 cycling pathways is critical to understanding and managing non-N-fixing cyanoHABs in western Lake Erie and other large eutrophic lakes. These kinds of measurements are exceedingly rare in the Great Lakes and other freshwater systems but are critically needed for informing and validating ecosystem models and management actions.",False,False,False,

## Field sampling
Water samples were collected in conjunction with the NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (GLERL) weekly HABs monitoring program in 2015, 2016, and 2017. Further details on bloom severity, initiation, and duration are presented in supplemental material. Three stations (WE6, WE2, WE4; Fig. 1) were sampled monthly from June to September 2015 (Supporting Information Table S1), and these plus WE13 (Fig. 1) were sampled in 2016 and 2017 during May-October (with an additional sampling at WE2 in April 2016). These stations represent a spatial and depth gradient moving away from the Maumee River inflow. Not all stations were sampled during each month, and sampling varied across years due to opportunity and weather constraints, particularly in 2016, when frequent storms interrupted scheduled sampling events. At each station, water was collected from two depths ($ 1 m below the surface and $ 1 m above the sediment-water interface) with a 5-L Niskin bottle. Ten L of water were collected from each depth and transferred into 20-L polyethylene carboys. Twelve ml of ambient nutrient (orthophosphate [o-PO 3À  4 ], NH þ 4 , urea, nitrite [NO À 2 ], NO À 3 ) samples were filtered immediately on-site (0.22-μm Nylon filters) into 15-ml polypropylene sample tubes and frozen in the field (dry ice) until transfer into a À20 C lab freezer. Other biological and physicochemical parameters (water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total P, Secchi depth, conductivity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), turbidity, total suspended solids (TSS), and chlorophyll a (Chl a), phycocyanin, and microcystin concentrations) were collected from surface waters and analyzed by NOAA GLERL and CIGLR (NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory; Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, University of Michigan, 2019).

One-L aliquots of water from each station and depth were amended with 15 NH 4 Cl (98 atom % 15 N, Sigma Aldrich; final concentration 8-24 μM, depending on sampling date and bloom conditions; Supporting Information Table S1), mixed, and distributed among six clear, colorless, 125-mL Nalgene bottles for triplicate light and dark (foil-wrapped) incubations. Initial samples from each bottle were collected immediately using a syringe and canula, filtered (0.22 μm), and frozen at À20 C until analysis. Bottles were incubated in a mesh bag for 16-25 h (Supporting Information Table S1) in simulated ambient lake conditions (outdoor water bath, not temperature-controlled) before being filtered (0.22 μm) into 15-mL polypropylene sample tubes and immediately frozen at À20 C until total NH þ 4 analysis ( 14 N + 15 N).

Total NH þ 4 concentrations were used to determine the 15 NH þ 4 to total NH þ 4 ratio for use in isotope dilution models (Blackburn 1979;Caperon et al. 1979). Potential NH þ 4 uptake rates were qualified as potential rates due to saturatinglevel isotope additions (McCarthy et al. 2013), but rates determined from saturating-level isotope amendments tend to converge with actual rates in highly productive aquatic systems (Glibert et al. 1988).In August 2015, 15 NH þ 4 was undetectable after 21 h of incubation. However, a clear decrease (up to 50%) in 15 NH þ 4 concentration was observed between the known amendment and initial sampling ($ 15 min).

This study (2015-2017) quantified NH þ 4 cycling rates in western Lake Erie along a spatial gradient from the primary nutrient source (Maumee River) into the main basin and assessed the role of internal NH þ 4 dynamics in supporting cya-noHABs. Our results help explain the persistence of high biomass and toxin concentrations despite N depletion.Water column NH þ 4 cycling We did not observe depth-driven differences for any rate measurement. Western Lake Erie is shallow and well mixed, and Microcystis can regulate buoyancy and migrate vertically in the water column (Wallace et al. 2000), perhaps explaining this observation. While extreme for Lake Erie, NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates measured in August 2015 were similar to maxima reported during a cyanoHAB in Lake Smith, Alaska (15.4 μmol L À1 h À1 ; Gu and Alexander 1993). At WE6 in August 2015, extracted phycocyanin and Chl a values from surface scums were 1700 and 1900 μg L À1 , respectively (NOAA Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory; Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research, University of Michigan, 2019), and NH þ 4 concentrations were near-undetectable (Table 1). NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates measured at a station < 1 km from WE6 five days prior (Supporting Information Fig. S8) were nearly two orders of magnitude less than our highest values, but approximately half of potential NH þ 4 uptake rates at WE6 in August 2016 and 2017, reflecting spatial and temporal variability in bloom biomass (Chaffin et al. 2021).",False,True,False,

Potential NH þ 4 uptake rates were greater in the light than dark, indicating expected photoautotrophic activity when light and NH þ 4 were available. Potential NH þ 4 uptake rates across both light and dark treatments were similar to but sometimes exceeded rates reported in other eutrophic systems, including Lake Champlain (Missisquoi Bay;McCarthy et al. 2013) and Lake Okeechobee (James et al. 2011). These rates were often much greater than those reported in Lake Balaton (Présing et al. 2001), Lake Michigan (Gardner et al. 2004), Lake Superior (Kumar et al. 2008), and several orders of magnitude greater than those previously reported in Lake Erie (Murphy 1980). In addition to differences in methodology, this large discrepancy is almost certainly explained by greatly reduced phytoplankton biomass following aggressive nutrient load mitigation strategies in the years prior to the study (Watson et al. 2016). Greater light NH þ 4 uptake rate maxima were reported in hypereutrophic Lake Taihu (Hampel et al. 2018), as well as in Planktothrix-dominated Sandusky Bay in Lake Erie (Hampel et al. 2019a), Lake Okeechobee (Hampel et al. 2019b), and subarctic Smith Lake in Alaska (Gu and Alexander 1993).",False,False,False,

WE4 and WE13 had lower rates than the westernmost stations, indicating less demand and recycling further from the nutrient source. We also predicted greater NH þ 4 uptake rates during peak bloom months, and although there was no difference between summer months (June-September) once August 2015 values were disregarded, positive relationships between light NH þ 4 uptake, temperature, phycocyanin, and Chl a support this prediction. hr hr P P Fig. 4. NH þ + demand during peak bloom periods (Supporting Information Fig. S7). This result agrees with findings from Lake Champlain (McCarthy et al. 2013) but contrasts with Microcystis-dominated Lake Taihu, where summer NH þ 4 regeneration rates could support 100% of community NH þ 4 demand (Hampel et al. 2018). Unlike Lake Erie, NH þ 4 is detectable in Taihu in August, and the external N load is much greater (Hampel et al. 2018). High NH þ 4 regeneration rates we report here represent a large, continuous NH þ 4 supply to support cyanoHAB biomass and toxin production, especially during peak biomass months (August and September), when cyanoHABs in Lake Erie are N-stressed (Chaffin et al. 2018). N stress also decreases intracellular concentrations of N-rich microcystins (Van de Waal et al. 2014). Our data suggest that toxin production during this period required regenerated NH þ 4 . Sediment-water interface N effluxes also supply bioavailable N to supplement water column NH þ 4 regeneration and external loading (Présing et al. 2008;McCarthy et al. 2016), as shown recently for the same study area of Lake Erie (Boedecker et al. 2020). Throughout the study, the 2015 bloom was the most severe in terms of biomass and areal coverage, followed by 2017 and 2016 (NOAA; Wynne et al. 2021; further description in Supporting Information). Even excluding August 2015 rates, 2015 exhibited higher potential NH þ 4 uptake rates than other years. N concentrations and cyanobacteria biomass were inversely related (Supporting Information Table S2), but neither biomass proxy was related to o-PO 3À 4 concentration. This pattern reflects seasonal cyanoHAB maxima, where bioavailable N became depleted by non-N-fixing Microcystis (Table 1). High TKN : TN ratios in the Maumee River load coincide with bloom formation in mid-July, several months after spring P loads (Newell et al. 2019). Microcystis-dominated blooms in  + equivalent to 76% of the annual TN load and 160% of the TN load during the sampling period (June-September). Including August 2015, the internal NH þ 4 regeneration load increases to 2.2 times the annual TN load and 4.5 times the TN load during the sampling season. In 2016 and 2017, regenerated NH þ 4 contributed NH þ 4 equivalent to 60% of the annual TN load and 1.3-1.5 times the seasonal TN load (Table 3). When monthly NH þ 4 regeneration rates were summed to calendar year (using April 2016 rates as a proxy for winter months), NH þ 4 regeneration could supply 240-250% of the annual TN load in 2016 and 2017. This relative contribution ($ 2Â) is similar to estimates for Missisquoi Bay (McCarthy et al. 2013), Lake Taihu (Hampel et al. 2018), and Sandusky Bay ($ 77%; Hampel et al. 2019a).",False,True,False,
199,10.1002/lno.12185,19,True,"Sediments also contribute to water column N availability in aquatic ecosystems (An and Gardner 2002;McCarthy et al. 2016). Recent work at many of the same stations as the present study reported that western basin sediments release NH þ
4 and urea at rates equivalent to 4-11% of the annual TN load (Boedecker et al. 2020). Combined, water column and sediments (NH þ 4 release $ 11% of water column NH þ 4 regeneration) represent a continuous supply of internal N when external N loads are minimal, cyanobacterial biomass is high, and water column N concentrations are depleted.Despite high spring nutrient loading from the Maumee River, cyanoHABs do not develop in western Lake Erie until mid-or late-July, corresponding with higher water temperatures and proportion of chemically reduced N forms in the external N load (Newell et al. 2019). The ratio of microcystin to phycocyanin peaked when regenerated NH þ 4 was (up to 50 times) greater than the Maumee River TN load from the previous week (F 2,46 = 2.70; p = 0.020; Supporting Information Fig. S9). This observation suggests a ""sweet spot,"" where NH þ 4 regeneration supports biomass and toxin production, and biomass maintenance is favored over toxin production (Harke and Gobler 2013). When NH þ 4 regeneration exceeded weekly TN loading by > 50 times (late August and September), toxin concentrations in biomass decreased and were not different from those when external loads were higher than internal loading (Supporting Information Fig. S9).Although microcystins contain, on average, 10 N per molecule (Honkanen et al. 1990), there were no strong relationships between any N species and toxin concentrations in the present study. Given the high rates of NH þ 4 regeneration reported here, snapshot sampling to determine DIN concentrations do not accurately represent N availability. However, NH þ 4 regeneration and potential uptake rates are good proxies for N demand and bioavailability (Gardner et al. 2017). Thus, water column NH þ 4 cycling rates, previously missing from the literature for this and most other freshwater systems, may represent key parameters to consider when developing models to predict toxin concentrations in cyanoHAB impacted systems.",False,False,False,
200,10.1002/lno.12185,20,True,"## Conclusions
This study contributes to the growing body of literature highlighting the importance of NH þ 4 and chemically reduced N in eutrophic lakes affected by seasonal cyanoHABs, especially those comprised of non-N-fixing, toxin-producing taxa (e.g., Microcystis). Water column NH þ 4 regeneration rates met or exceeded external N loads in the western basin and help explain why non-N-fixing cyanoHABs proliferate despite minimal external N loading. These results reinforce the need to manage external N loading to mitigate growth and toxin production of non-N-fixing cyanobacteria (McCarthy et al. 2013(McCarthy et al. , 2016;;Gobler et al. 2016;Newell et al. 2019). External nutrient loads stimulate biomass and toxin production, which becomes the substrate for NH þ 4 regeneration when cells are grazed and/or remineralized in the water column (Gardner and Lee 1975;McCarthy et al. 2013) and sediments (McCarthy et al. 2016;Boedecker et al. 2020). Thus, while in-system turnover should be accounted for in management and modeling applications, reducing external nutrient loads from watersheds remains the key to mitigating the global proliferation of contemporary cyanoHABs that cannot fix atmospheric N and produce N-rich toxins.## Data Availability Statement

## Abstract
Coastal ecosystems are highly dynamic areas for carbon cycling and are likely to be negatively impacted by increasing ocean acidification. This research focused on dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) in the Mississippi Sound to understand the influence of local rivers on coastal acidification. This area receives large fluxes of freshwater from local rivers, in addition to episodic inputs from the Mississippi River through a human-built diversion, the Bonnet Carré Spillway. Sites in the Sound were sampled monthly from August 2018 to November 2019 and weekly from June to August 2019 in response to an extended spillway opening. Prior to the 2019 spillway opening, the contribution of the local, lower alkalinity rivers to the Sound may have left the study area more susceptible to coastal acidification during winter months, with aragonite saturation states (Ω ar ) < 2. After the spillway opened, despite a large increase in TA throughout the Sound, aragonite saturation states remained low, likely due to hypoxia and increased CO 2 concentrations in subsurface waters. Increased Mississippi River input could represent a new normal in the Sound's hydrography during spring and summer months. The spillway has been utilized more frequently over the last two decades due to increasing precipitation in the Mississippi River watershed, which is primarily associated with climate change. Future increases in freshwater discharge and the associated declines in salinity, dissolved oxygen, and Ω ar in the Sound will likely be detrimental to oyster stocks and the resilience of similar ecosystems to coastal acidification.",False,False,False,
212,10.1002/lno.12237,1,True,"## Untitled Section
Coastal regions are highly dynamic and impacted by several stressors that should be considered holistically if researchers aim is to understand how these systems are going to change under predicted climate change scenarios (Doney et al. 2020). Rivers have the capacity to reflect the biogeochemical signature of their watersheds and can effect change in downstream estuaries and coastal systems (Wurtsbaugh et al. 2019). Watersheds deliver nutrients to coastal systems that can be vital for stimulating and maintaining valuable fish and shellfish populations (Wurtsbaugh et al. 2019;Doney et al. 2020). However, in recent years, nutrient concentrations have been increasing in continental waters around the world due to the increased anthropogenic inputs from the use of fertilizers and wastewater outflows (Conley et al. 2009). These increased nutrient inputs can lead to eutrophication, hypoxia, and harmful algal blooms in downstream estuaries and coastal environments (Wurtsbaugh et al. 2019). Rivers can exacerbate hypoxia through stratification when fresh river water blocks air-sea exchange with the saltier subsurface waters (Schroeder et al. 1990). In addition to nutrients, rivers can also carry an abundance of organic material that can be respired in these downstream systems to further exacerbate hypoxia (Laurent et al. 2017). Furthermore, rivers have widely variable pH, alkalinity, and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations based on differing watershed geology, residence times, and whether they are primarily dominated by carbonate ions or humic substances (Cai and Wang 1998).This study measured carbonate system parameters in the Mississippi Sound and local river end-members to understand how these freshwater sources impact the downstream carbonate chemistry. The carbonate system is commonly tracked with measurements of DIC (DIC = [CO 2 ] + [HCO 3 À ] + [CO 2À 3 ]; Dickson 1981;Dickson et al. 2007) and total alkalinity (TA).",False,False,False,
213,10.1002/lno.12237,2,True,"TA is comprised of carbonate alkalinity ([HCO 3 À ] + 2[CO 2À 3 ]) as well as the excess of other proton acceptors over proton donors present in the water at a zero level of protons at pH 4.5 Dickson 1981). The calcium carbonate saturation state of waters within oyster reef environments is an important consideration for developing oyster populations. The saturation state of aragonite (Ω ar ) is defined as the ion solubility product of calcium and carbonate ion, divided by the equilibrium solubility product (Ω ar = [Ca 2+ ] [CO 2þ  3 ]/K sp ). Water is supersaturated when Ω > 1 and undersaturated when Ω < 1. However, it has been observed that many calcifying organisms need Ω values much higher than 1 to continue secreting their shells (Kleypas et al. 1999;Pilson 2014). For instance, laboratory studies have shown Crassostrea virginica to have decreased calcification rates around Ω ar = 1.4 (Ries et al. 2016). This means that C. virginica juveniles that form amorphous CaCO 3 or aragonite are more susceptible to ocean acidification than adults that tend to form calcite shells (Lemasson et al. 2017).",False,False,False,
214,10.1002/lno.12237,3,True,"Coastal oceans are affected by several increasing anthropogenic stressors, including increased riverine inputs with elevated nutrient concentrations that stimulate phytoplankton growth (Doney 2010). Coastal areas can act as large sinks for anthropogenic CO 2 during spring and early summer due to this elevated primary productivity, especially in the northern Gulf of Mexico, which receives large fluxes of freshwater and nutrients from the Mississippi River (Lohrenz and Cai 2006;Huang et al. 2015;Lohrenz et al. 2018). Increased primary production, in addition to stratification due to the input of low salinity waters, can induce hypoxia in subsurface waters from the oxidation of organic matter, which, in turn, can enhance local coastal acidification due the release of respiratory CO 2 (Cai et al. 2011;Laurent et al. 2017;Feely et al. 2018). There has been extensive coastal inorganic carbon research in the mid-to outer shelf region of the northern Gulf of Mexico and along the Louisiana Shelf (Cai et al. 2011;Wang et al. 2013;Feely et al. 2018), but few studies have investigated inorganic carbon dynamics along the Mississippi Sound inner shelf and estuaries. These coastal areas serve as valuable habitats for juvenile fish, bivalves, corals, and other organisms that are sensitive to changes in pH, which may be driven by increases in freshwater and coastal acidification (Doney et al. 2020).",False,False,False,
215,10.1002/lno.12237,4,True,"During our study period, the Bonnet Carré Spillway (BCS) was opened for a record number of days (123) in summer 2019 and this was the first time in history that it was opened twice in 1 yr. The BCS is a diversion off the Mississippi River that was constructed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1931 to alleviate high flow conditions from the main stem of the river. Opening occurred from 27 February to 11 April and 10 May to 27 July during 2019 (https://www.mvn.usace.  army.mil/Missions/Mississippi-River-Flood-Control/Bonnet- Carre-Spillway-Overview/Spillway-Operation-Information/, accessed 01 July 2021). These openings released an estimated 38.1 billion m 3 (1 st opening: total discharge = 15.1 billion m 3 with an average daily flow = 4060 m 3 s À1 ; 2 nd opening: total discharge = 23.0 billion m 3 with an average daily flow = 3420 m 3 s À1 ) (https://www.mvn.usace.army.mil/  Missions/Mississippi-River-Flood-Control/Bonnet-Carre-Spill  way-Overview/Spillway-Operation-Information/, accessed 01 July 2021) of Mississippi River water into Lake Pontchartrain (Fig. 1a), which is an estuary connected to the Mississippi Sound. The 2019 spillway opening had devastating impacts to the local fisheries and recreational economy along the Mississippi coast due to the loss of local oysters (Gledhill et al. 2020), closing of beaches from harmful algal bloom presence, widespread hypoxia, and the stranding of numerous dolphins and turtles. This event was also detrimental to the local fisheries economy as the Mississippi Sound region, which historically served as an important ecosystem for the oyster fishery for the state, with the majority of oyster landings for the state of Mississippi coming from the western Sound (Dugas et al. 1997).",False,False,False,

We assessed temporal trends in DIC and TA in the Mississippi Sound during the study period. In addition, we investigated how the local rivers affect carbonate chemistry in the Mississippi Sound. With this data we infer the susceptibility of the area to future coastal acidification. Due to a substantial freshwater flux from the BCS between February and July 2019, this study provides a record of how a transient introduction of Mississippi River water impacts the carbonate system in the Mississippi Sound. By understanding how our region is impacted by increased freshwater and subsequent eutrophication and hypoxia, we are better equipped to assess coastal acidification impacts in the future.",False,False,False,

## Study area
The Mississippi Sound is a diurnal, microtidal environment with an average salinity of 15 (on the practical salinity scale 1978) and an average depth of 4 m (Bianchi et al. 1999). The Mississippi Sound (Fig. 1a) is separated from the Mississippi Bight by a chain of barrier islands that restrict flow into and out of the Sound. Therefore, the water in the Sound generally has salinities less than 20 near the coast of Mississippi and greater than 30 near the barrier islands (Vinogradov et al. 2004). This region receives substantial rainfall, with average annual precipitation exceeding 160 cm and highest precipitation occurring from July to September, with evaporation rates around 120 cm yr À1 (Bianchi et al. 1999). In addition, during periods of increased river runoff from seasonal rainfall or episodic events, the Mississippi Sound waters can become much fresher (Ho et al. 2019). The Mississippi Sound is heavily influenced by natural and anthropogenically altered riverine discharge (Bianchi et al. 1999). Rivers that discharge directly into this area include the Pearl, Wolf, Jourdan, Pascagoula, and Mobile Rivers (Table 1; Fig. 1). The Mississippi River can also influence this area through the BCS (Fig. 1a), which was constructed to reduce discharge through the main stem of the river during high flow conditions to protect the City of New Orleans and other municipalities from flooding. The Mississippi River system has much higher TA and DIC compared to the smaller, local Mississippi and Alabama rivers (including the Pearl, Wolf, Jourdan, Pascagoula, and Mobile Rivers) (Cai 2003;Wang et al. 2013). When the BCS is open, it allows up to 7080 m 3 s À1 of Mississippi River water to discharge into the Lake Pontchartrain estuary (https://www.  mvn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Mississippi-River-Flood-Control/  Bonnet-Carre-Spillway-Overview/Spillway-Operation-Informa  tion/, accessed 01 July 2020). The water then flows through the Rigolets and Chef Menteur Pass out of Lake Pontchartrain toward the Mississippi and Chandeleur Sounds over a 4-to 5-week time period (Parra et al. 2020). Historically, the episodic opening of this spillway has resulted in large fluxes of freshwater to the Mississippi Sound that have led to widespread oyster reef mortality (Posadas 2019;Gledhill et al. 2020). Although the economic damage to this region is still not fully known, the Mississippi Department of Marine Resources has estimated the impact to fisheries alone to be over $160,000,000 (http://gulfcoastnews.com/GCNnewSpillwayLawsuit122719.htm, accessed 23 April 2021). Water flowing toward the sea from Lake Pontchartrain first enters Lake Borgne, and then must flow into the westernmost portion of Mississippi Sound. From there, water can flow northeast further into Mississippi Sound, southeast into Chandeleur Sound or directly east into the Mississippi Bight/ open Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 1).",False,True,False,

Beach stations (""BCH"" stations) were sampled on a monthly basis, weather and environmental conditions permitting, from August 2018 to November 2019 (Fig. 1b). Salinity and dissolved oxygen (DO) (mg L À1 ) were collected with a YSI EXO2 multiparameter sonde, with an accuracy of AE 0.1 ppt and AE 0.1 mg L À1 , respectively. Sampling methods and sample analysis for DIC and TA measurements followed standard protocols described in Dickson et al. (2007) with modifications due to site conditions, described as follows. Surface samples were collected from five BCH pier locations (Fig. 1b) with gloved hands by triple rinsing a 500-mL Nalgene wide-mouth high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with site water and then completely filling the sample bottle. The samples were then stored on ice in a dark cooler which was placed out of direct sunlight, while being transported back to the laboratory. Once in the laboratory, the samples were filtered with 0.45-μm Whatman Puradisc polypropylene syringe filters into a 250-mL borosilicate glass container with screw thread GL 45 caps and 50 μL of a saturated reagent grade HgCl 2 solution was added to preserve each sample. The bottle was inverted several times to disperse the HgCl 2 and then samples were stored in the dark, at room temperature (approximately 24 C) and analyzed the following day. BCH samples were not collected during summer 2019 while BCS sampling occurred due to the resources required to conduct the BCS sampling on a weekly basis during the summer. To examine temporal trends within the entire study period, we compare the nearest coastal BCS stations with the BCH data set.",False,False,False,
219,10.1002/lno.12237,8,True,"BCS (Fig. 1b) response samples were collected on a weekly basis from Mississippi Sound from June to August 2019 from two small boats, where one boat sampled Stats. 1-8 and the 2 nd sampled 9-16. Surface salinity was collected from a YSI ProDSS multiparameter sonde, with an accuracy of AE0.1 ppt. Bottom salinity was collected using the same YSI ProDSS handheld multiparameter sonde on each sampling date during continuous vertical profiling, in addition to DO (mg L À1 ). Bottle samples were collected at the 16 stations throughout the Mississippi Sound and Bight using Niskin bottles at 0.5 m below the surface and 0.5 m above the bottom (Fig. 1b). For DIC and TA samples, a glass 250-mL Pyrex bottle was triple rinsed with sample water and then filled smoothly and completely. Following collection, the headspace was adjusted by removing seawater so that 1% of the bottle volume was left to allow for water expansion (i.e., 2.5 mL headspace for a 250-mL bottle). Samples were stored in a cooler on ice until the boats had returned from sampling all stations. The samples were amended with 50 μL of saturated reagent grade HgCl 2 solution, capped tight, stored in a cooler for transportation and then in a refrigerator until analysis (usually within 3-5 d).Samples were also collected from seven rivers in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana to constrain river end-member values for DIC and TA (Fig. 1a). The rivers included: Wolf, Jourdan, Pascagoula, Mobile, Mississippi, Pearl, and East Pearl. The Mississippi and Pearl Rivers were sampled once in June and July 2019, and the rest of the rivers were sampled only once in June 2019. The samples were collected and transported using similar methods to the BCH sampling, amended with mercuric chloride once back in lab and stored in a refrigerator until analysis (usually next day).",False,False,False,
220,10.1002/lno.12237,9,True,"Nutrients for BCH samples were collected in acid washed 250-mL Nalgene bottles utilizing the protocol outlined in Shiller (2003) and analyzed for soluble reactive phosphate and dissolved silicate. Briefly, the acid-cleaned bottle was attached to a nonmetallic pole to collect the water sample. The bottle was rinsed three times and filled by a sampler wearing polyethylene gloves. After collection, samples were stored on ice until returned to the laboratory, where samples were filtered through acid washed 0.45-μm Whatman Puradisc polypropylene syringe filters into 125-mL acid-washed brown Nalgene bottles after one filtrate rinse. Samples were then frozen until analysis on a SEAL Auto Analyzer (AA3 HR).Nutrients for BCS samples were collected in precleaned and acid washed (10% HCl) 1 L HDPE samples bottles that were rinsed with deionized water then rinsed three times with sample water before being filled and stored on ice until return to the laboratory. Samples were filtered through pre-combusted glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/F) and the filtrate was collected in pre-cleaned, acid washed 60-mL HDPE bottles after three filtrate rinses and frozen until analysis for soluble reactive phosphate and dissolved silicate.Salinity in the Mississippi Sound will be influenced by both Mississippi River water influx from the BCS as well as by local rivers in Mississippi/Alabama, that will be treated separate from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River System for this study. The term ""local rivers"" will be used to refer to the Wolf, Jourdan, Pascagoula, Mobile, Mississippi, Pearl, and East Pearl Rivers, that are isotopically indistinguishable from one another. The Mississippi River and other local rivers were expected to have distinct inorganic carbon parameters (Wagner and Slowly 2011). To distinguish between freshwater sources, we make use of the results of an end-member mixing model based on the oxygen isotopic composition (δ 18 O) of water, described further in the next section. Water isotope samples were collected using methods from Sanial et al.",False,False,False,

Briefly, the acidcleaned bottle was attached to a nonmetallic pole to collect the water sample. The bottle was rinsed three times and filled by a sampler wearing polyethylene gloves. Samples were transported back to shore, filtered with 0.45-μm Whatman Puradisc polypropylene syringe filters, and stored in glass bottles tightly sealed with Parafilm to prevent evaporation before analyzed by isotope ratio infrared spectroscopy (L2120-i cavity ringdown spectrometer, Picarro Inc.). As described in detail by Sanial et al. (2019), there are distinct δ 18 O and salinity endmember values for Gulf of Mexico seawater, Mississippi River water, and the local rivers. Thus, from the δ 18 O measurements, one can derive water fractions of these three water types in all of the BCS samples. We use these fractions to predict DIC and TA based on end-member values and the assumption of conservative mixing. The degree to which our observations diverge from this prediction is one way to assess nonconservative behavior. The δ 18 O data itself will be fully described in a subsequent publication.",False,False,False,
222,10.1002/lno.12237,11,True,"## Carbon system and statistical analysis
Samples were analyzed for inorganic carbon using methods from Dickson et al. (2007) by acidifying 30 mL of sample with 4 mL of 2 M phosphoric acid and measuring the extracted CO 2 on a UIC Coulometer. Samples were analyzed for TA by Gran Titration (Gran 1952) on an TA Titrator AS-ALK2 (Apollo SciTech) on the day following DIC analysis. Samples were brought to 24 C using a water jacket before both DIC and TA analysis. In some coastal environments, organic anions can appreciably contribute to TA (Cai et al. 1998). Borate and sulfate terms are assumed proportional to salinity, and we measured soluble reactive phosphate and silicate, according to methods in Strickland and Parsons (1972), to correct for their contribution to TA. Organic alkalinity was not estimated, although a recent study in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya estuary found organic alkalinity was less than 1% of the TA in that region (Yang et al. 2015). The BCS and river samples were unfiltered due to time constraints, while the monthly BCH samples were filtered. Therefore, we use the term total inorganic carbon (TIC) for BCS and river samples and DIC for BCH samples. To determine the effect of filtration on TA and DIC for the BCH samples, a filtered and unfiltered sample was collected in November 2017 at all five BCH locations (Fig. 1b). One set of BCH samples (5) was filtered according to the methods described in the BCH Sampling locations and techniques; while the duplicate set of samples (5) was not filtered, all other methodology remained the same between the two sample sets. We were able to conclude that the mean concentration of each set for both TA and DIC/TIC filtered vs. unfiltered samples were not statistically different from one another (one factor ANOVA, p = 0.99, df = 1 for TA and p = 0.87 for DIC/TIC, df = 1).",False,False,False,
223,10.1002/lno.12237,12,True,"Our methods were intercalibrated using certified reference materials (CRMs), namely the CO 2 in seawater reference material produced by Andrew Dickson, for data quality assurance and control. The DIC/TIC samples were not subjected to replicate measurement on the coulometer system given concerns over biasing effects from gas exchange on the samples during processing, however, by repeat measurements of the CRMs the relative standard deviation of DIC measurements on this instrument was determined to be AE 1%. This relatively high error likely resulted from lower reproducibility related to manual syringe injection on our coulometer compared to automated systems which tend to have higher precision. The manual syringe injection requires the filling of a syringe, accurately measuring its weight on a balance, and injecting the metal tip into a rubber cap into the titration cell. Although they were transported on ice, there still could have been biological activity occurring. There could have also been loss to the atmosphere when opening the bottle to preserve it as well. In addition, collection in an HDPE is not standard protocol, which could account for some of the uncertainty; however, according to Huang et al. (2012), there appear to be small differences between storing samples in different bottle types and under room temperature vs. refrigeration. All TA samples were analyzed in duplicates or triplicates until a precision of roughly 20 μM or better was reached, which equates to a maximum 1% relative standard error for seawater and up to a maximum 5% error for fresher samples that have much lower TA. However, the relative standard deviation from repeat measurements of CRMs for TA on this instrument was AE0.1%. Reproducibility on fresher TA samples could have been improved by further replicates on the titrator and by analyzing a freshwater TA standard, as the Dickson standard is prepared at oceanic salinity. The DIC and TA measurements were externally intercalibrated by analyzing replicate samples with Dr. Xinping Hu's laboratory at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi.

Essentially, the δ 18 O of H 2 O from the Mississippi River (MR), seawater (SW) and the local rivers (LR) are distinct; thus, using a three end-member linear mixing model, fractions of water from these three sources were derived. It is important to note the local Mississippi/Alabama rivers are grouped into one endmember because they have similar δ 18 O values. Briefly, this model is based on the principle that δ 18 O and salinity exhibit conservative mixing. Thus, a set of two linear mixing equations can be used to describe the mixing between these three end-members:
where δ 18 O sample and Sal sample are the water isotopic composition and salinity of the sample; f SW,MR,LR are the fractions of seawater, Mississippi River, and local river water; δ 18 O SW,MR,LR and Sal SW,MR,LR are the isotopic composition and salinity (from Mg/Ca ratios) of the three end-members. The sum of the end-member fractions should be equal to one:
These three equations are independent, and the only unknown variables are the fractions of each end-member; therefore, they can be used to solve for each water source fraction. This was done using a non-negative least squares optimization (function ""lsqnonneg"" in MATLAB), where negative values were corrected to zero (Sanial et al. 2019). Using these calculated water fractions, we calculated predicted TA and TIC values at the BCS surface stations based on the contribution of each end-member and the measured end-member values, assuming conservative behavior (Table 2). The TA and TIC end-member for the local river freshwater end-member was a weighted average for each month (June, July, and August) depending on measured discharge from available USGS data (http://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/, accessed 2020 May 10) for the Pearl, Wolf, Pascagoula, and Mobile Rivers (no discharge data were available for Jourdan River). The seawater endmember for TA and DIC comes from samples collected on student teaching cruises to the Deep-Water Horizon site and the δ 18 O end-member was obtained from the Consortium for oil spill exposure pathways in Coastal River-Dominated Ecosystems data (Sanial et al. 2019) since open ocean water was not sampled during the BCS sampling.

Predicted freshwater end-members In the BCH data, TA showed a positive correlation with salinity (r = 0.85, df = 62, p < 0.01) with greatest variability at low salinities (Fig. 2a). This correlation indicates that TA distribution is mostly conservative for our study region (Fig. 2a). DIC had similar trends with salinity as TA (Fig. 2c) but had a lower correlation coefficient (r = 0.77, df = 62, p < 0.01) and, thus, appeared to behave less conservatively in this area. The scatter in both variables could have also resulted from the analytical error stated previously, mixing of multiple end-members, or changing endmember concentrations over the timescale of mixing, all of which could contribute to a nonlinear relationship despite being conservative. These correlations only include BCH or BCS sample data and do not include river and seawater end-member data, noted by black stars in Fig. 2 for reference to sample values. Using BCH samples, we determined that the effective freshwater TA end-member (derived from the y-intercept of the linear regression between TA and salinity) for this region was 731 AE 64 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 2a) and an effective freshwater DIC end-member of 778 AE 70 μmol kg À1 . This effective end-member falls between the measured values for the Mobile and Pearl Rivers at 862 and 530 μmol kg À1 (TIC = 844 and 567 μmol kg À1 ), respectively (Fig. 2a; Table 2). All other local rivers had measured TA values < 400 μmol kg À1 and TIC < 450 μmol kg À1 (Table 2). Although Model I linear regression was used assuming salinity is an independent variable, similar conclusions were reached about the apparent freshwater end-members using Model II type linear regression (reduced major axis regression) which assumes both salinity and TA are dependent variables (e.g., 607 AE 66 μmol kg À1 for effective TA end-member and 605 AE 74 μmol kg À1 for effective DIC end-member).",False,True,False,
227,10.1002/lno.12237,16,True,"For BCS data, TIC and TA showed a positive correlation with salinity (respectively, r = 0.83, df = 347, p < 0.01; and r = 0.84, df = 348, p < 0.01; Fig. 2b). These correlations do not include the river and seawater end-member data. The correlation between TIC and TA with salinity indicates that TA distribution was mostly conservative during the BCS opening. The comparison of predicted TA, based on the water isotope-derived source water fractions and assumed TA end-members, with the measured TA for the BCS surface samples also indicated that TA for this region appeared to behave mostly conservatively (Supporting Information Fig. S1a). There was some removal of TA resulting in a linear regression lower than the 1 : 1 line (Supporting Information Fig. S1a). This trend was likely due to biological uptake from the calcification of shells that consumes carbonate ions from seawater or from uncertainty in the end-member values and water composition. This could also have resulted from an overprediction of TA because organic alkalinity was assumed to play a negligible role in this system based on previous studies in the Mississippi River coastal estuary region (Yang et al. 2015). However, the predicted TA was calculated based on both Mississippi River and local river end-members, for which there are little data on organic alkalinity, which could have higher contributions of organic alkalinity like those found in other river systems (Cai et al. 1998). Predicted TA had a root mean square error (RMSE) of 9.7 μmol kg À1 , which is about 1% of the average TA observed. TIC appeared to behave less conservatively, demonstrating a larger RMSE between predicted and measured TIC of 52 μmol kg À1 , or about 5% of the average observed TIC (Supporting Information Fig. S1b). This indicates more nonconservative influence on the data, likely from primary production, respiration, and air-sea exchange. The data from the BCS sampling determined a freshwater TA effective end-member of 1276 AE 24 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 2b) (derived from the y-intercept of Model I linear regression between TA and salinity) and a freshwater TIC effective endmember of 1193 AE 23 μmol kg À1 . Therefore, while the BCS was open, the effective TA end-member fell between the measured values for the Mississippi River and Mobile River, with lower values from Sta. 1 that were similar to the measured Pearl River end-member (Table 2; Fig. 2b). Model II linear regression gave a similar effective freshwater TA end-member (1162 AE 25 μmol kg À1 for effective TA end-member and 1083 AE 23 μmol kg À1 for effective DIC end-member). This observed change in predicted freshwater end-member values may indicate that the Sound is influenced by varying contributions of each freshwater end-member to a different extent throughout the year.",False,True,False,

Data from the BCH stations were compared with BCS Stas. 3, 6, and 9 due to the lack of monthly BCH sampling during summer 2019 due to limited resources. Comparing the monthly BCH sampling data with these three most adjacent BCS stations, the lowest average salinity was observed during the 2 nd opening of the spillway and the salinity did not return to values similar to those observed prespillway opening until about a month after the BCS closed (Fig. 3a). There was a general decrease in TA observed from August into March with a minimum in late March at an average of 829 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 3c). A similar trend was observed with the DIC/TIC, with a minimum in late March of 869 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 3b). Between late May and August, after the 2 nd opening of the BCS, there was a strong increase in salinity, TA, and DIC/TIC (Fig. 3a,c). It is important to note the discharge rate from the BCS was not constant throughout the summer. The Army Corps of Engineers reduced the discharge from $4200 m 3 s À1 around mid-June to $2800 m 3 s À1 at the beginning of July and then started further reducing discharge around 13 July (https://  www.mvn.usace.army.mil/Missions/Mississippi-River-Flood-Control/Bonnet-Carre-Spillway-Overview/Spillway-Operation-Information/, accessed 01 July 2021), likely resulting in reduced Mississippi River water entering Mississippi Sound. This trend was observed in the oxygen isotope data, with decreased Mississippi River fraction at the western stations from late June to early July, which continued to decrease after the 2 nd closure of the BCS (Fig. 4a).

To determine which freshwater sources were influencing the Sound, we used a linear end-member mixing model, previously described (Sanial et al. 2019), to deconvolve the relative amount of local river input and Mississippi River input. Our oxygen isotope results indicate surface water in the western Mississippi Sound received larger contributions of Mississippi River water while the BCS was open, excepting Sta. BCS 1, which, as previously mentioned, was primarily influenced by the Pearl River (Fig. 4a). After the BCS closed, the plume of river water moved eastward through the Sound until it dissipated about a month after the closure (Fig. 4a). Similarly, salinity measurements indicate the same expansion of the Mississippi River plume while the BCS was open. The recovery of the Sound was indicated by increasing surface salinities (average increased from 11.8 AE 7.3 to 17.3 AE 6.4 after spillway closure) during the 3 weeks following the closure of the BCS (Fig. 4b). Saturation states (Ω ar ) were reduced in the western Sound and at stations closest to the coast (i.e., 9, 12, and 15) (Fig. 4d). The Ω ar began to increase (average increased from 2.3 AE 1.2 to 2.9 AE 1.2 after spillway closure) in surface waters throughout the Sound approximately 1 month after the BCS had closed (Fig. 4d). TA and TIC had a similar pattern (TA: 1750 AE 375 to 1905 AE 293 μmol kg À1 after spillway closure, TIC: 1602 AE 302 to 1698 AE 238 μmol kg À1 after spillway closure); however, both parameters remained fairly high across the Sound, with the exception of BCS Sta. 1 having the lowest observed TA (Fig. 4c,d), due to the influence of the Pearl River (Fig. 4a). Coastal stations also had lower TA and Ω ar compared to the rest of the Sound and higher TIC, which could have resulted from local river influence (Fig. 4c-e).",False,False,False,

Bottom depths ranged from 1.5 m at coastal stations to 11 m at Sta. 14 outside the barrier islands, with many stations having a subsurface sampling depth between 2 and 6 m. In subsurface waters, salinities were lowest (<5) in the western-most stations (1-5) of the Sound and at coastal stations (9, 12, and 15). Most stations remained brackish (>15) throughout the time series (average increased from 20.4 AE 9.4 to 22.8 AE 7.5 after spillway closure) (Fig. 5a). There was strong stratification between fresher surface waters and saltier bottom waters until approximately 3 weeks after the BCS closed (Figs. 4b,5a,6). TA was generally > 2000 μmol kg À1 except for BCS Sta. 1 (near the Pearl River discharge) and at Sta. 15 before the BCS closed, which was likely due to discharge from the Pascagoula and Mobile Rivers (Figs. 1b,5b). A similar trend was observed in the TIC concentrations, with Stas. 1 and 15 having the lowest concentrations and many of the stations remaining constant throughout the study period (average increased from 1787 AE 366 to 1886 AE 286 μmol kg À1 after spillway closure) (Fig. 5c).

This was likely due to hypoxic conditions and elevated pCO 2 concentrations observed in subsurface waters throughout the Sound that persisted during the summer (average pCO 2 decreased from 849 AE 560 to 727 AE 444 μatm after spillway closure) (Figs. 5d,e,6).",False,False,False,
232,10.1002/lno.12237,21,True,"## Discussion
The TA values measured in the Mississippi Sound during this study were generally lower than those observed in previous studies offshore of estuaries within the northern Gulf of Mexico. TA generally ranges from 2325 to 2400 μmol kg À1 at salinities from 24 to 25 along the coast of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Wang et al. 2013), though samples from flowthrough systems and surface bottles from the GOMECC-3 cruise in July-August 2017 showed TA values as low as 2050 μmol kg À1 , with salinity as low as 24, near the shelfbreak across the Mississippi Bight (Barbero et al. 2019). Our study observed a range in TA values for BCH samples from 584 to 2210 μmol kg À1 , with an average of 1447 μmol kg À1 for the BCH sampling data. The BCH sites experienced a wide range of salinities, with values near 1 at BCH Sta. 1 while the BCS was open, up to 28 in late summer (Fig. 2a). The lower observed TA in this region is likely due to the input of freshwater from local Mississippi and Alabama rivers, like the Pearl River, into the system (Table 2; Fig. 3). Our river water results (Table 2) are consistent with some other rivers from the southeast United States (Cai and Wang 1998) that demonstrate high TIC/TA ratios potentially related to hydrological or geological characteristics of the watersheds. When considering ocean acidification in the Gulf of Mexico, many researchers consider shelf values of TA, which tend to be higher than those shown here along the Mississippi coast. However, the input of local, low TA river water has a more direct impact on oyster reefs since they are commonly found in estuaries where these rivers discharge, unless the estuary directly receives input from the high TA Mississippi River. The majority of oyster reefs in this region are located in Mobile Bay, Biloxi Bay, and outside of Bay Saint Louis extending south through the Sound toward the western most barrier island. The contribution of these less alkaline rivers, that is, the Mobile, Biloxi, and East Pearl Rivers, will result in decreased buffering capacity and decreased Ω ar , which will likely be harmful to local oyster reefs.",False,True,False,
233,10.1002/lno.12237,22,True,"Notably, while the BCS was open, the range in TA was elevated, with upper values similar to those previously observed in the northern Gulf of Mexico and coastal Texas area with a range from 559 μmol kg À1 (845 μmol kg À1 excluding Sta. 1 which is heavily influenced by the Pearl River) to 2410 μmol kg À1 (2242 μmol kg À1 excluding stations outside the barrier islands) (Fig. 2b), with an average of 1896 μmol kg À1 . The range in salinity for the BCS samples was from near 1 in the western Sound stations to 35 at the stations outside the barrier islands (31 for stations inside the Sound) (Figs. 4b,5a). The observed increase in the effective TA end-member is likely due to the increased flux of higher alkalinity Mississippi River water into the Sound that also led to increased Ω ar at the coastal stations during the summer (Figs. 3d,4a). However, the low Ω ar observed from late fall to early summer indicate that this area may be susceptible to future coastal acidification. Monthly average values for Ω ar across the coastal stations during this study were always below 2.5, with averages <1 from late fall to early summer (Fig. 3d). In comparison, nearby studies have found supersaturated Ω ar in shelf and slope waters the northern Gulf of Mexico typically ranging from 2.5 to 4.0, with inner Louisiana Shelf waters impacted by the Mississippi River as high as 5.0 (Wang et al. 2013).",False,False,False,
234,10.1002/lno.12237,23,True,"It is important to note that CO2SYS possibly underestimates saturation states of the very low salinity samples that are likely impacted primarily by the Mississippi River. This is due to the fact that CO2SYS assumes zero calcium concentration at zero salinity but the MS River has calcium concentrations around 1 mM (Borrok et al. 2018). However, this would mostly be a concern for stations that had higher fractions of MS River water. For example, Stas. 2-4 may have underestimated saturation states because they had high MS River influence that CO2SYS does not account for, however these stations were never below 0.5 salinity (Supporting Information Data S1) and so this may have a small impact on the values. At Sta. 1, where we did see salinities below 0.5, we observed a lower MS River fraction, likely due to the Pearl River influence. Therefore, while the saturation state may still be underestimated given that it is outside the salinity range for our constants, it is less likely that it is underestimated due to the higher than predicted calcium concentrations from the MS River. For the BCH data, the BCS was not open, so the MS River did not have an impact on the calcium concentration at these stations. Therefore, it is possible the saturation states were underestimated due to the constants we use at very low salinities; however, local rivers do not generally have high calcium concentrations in this region compared to the MS River.",False,False,False,
235,10.1002/lno.12237,24,True,"The period of observed undersaturated conditions in Mississippi Sound (late fall to early summer; Fig. 3d) is also significant, since this is when newly spawned juvenile oysters are attempting to mature into sexually mature adults (Hayes and Menzel 1981;Shumway 1996). The oyster fishery in the Mississippi Sound and most of the Gulf Coast states depends on the species C. virginica (Dugas et al. 1997), which are most abundant at salinities between 10 and 30 (Galtsoff 1964;Shumway 1996;Dugas et al. 1997). This species generally spawns during warm summer months (once water reaches approximately 25 C) and take about 4 months to reach sexual maturity (Hayes and Menzel 1981;Shumway 1996). During this juvenile phase, C. virginica shells are composed mostly of aragonite until they form their thicker, primarily calcite-based shells as adults and are thus more sensitive to changes in pH during their early life stages (Lee 1990;Lemasson et al. 2017). Aragonite is less saturated in seawater relative to calcite, which also means that juveniles need to expend more energy to maintain their shells which will consume energy that could be used for other processes like growth, reproductive development, and filter feeding. Pressure from coastal acidification could likely stress these juveniles and impact retention between generations (Waldbusser et al. 2015). Reduced Ω ar within the Mississippi Sound during this crucial developmental period for the juvenile oysters may have contributed to the reduction in oyster landings over recent years (Posadas 2019).Although the BCS was open, there was an observed increase in average Ω ar in surface water at the coastal stations (Fig. 3d).",False,False,False,
236,10.1002/lno.12237,25,True,"However, in surface waters across the Sound, Ω ar values were lowest in surface and subsurface stations primarily in the western Sound and at coastal stations (Figs 4e,5f,6). This is likely because the Mississippi River is primarily a bicarbonate dominated system (Cai 2003) and saturation state is primarily determined by carbonate and calcium ion concentrations (Kleypas et al. 1999). Therefore, despite the overall increase in TA, there was a minimal effect on surface saturation states. These results indicate that the coastal regions in the northern Gulf of Mexico may be more susceptible to coastal acidification in the future than previously thought, as this region has often been considered more resilient to changes from ocean acidification because of its high TA : DIC ratio (Wang et al. 2013). In addition, the large flux of freshwater during this time from the BCS likely made conditions unfavorable for the local oysters that prefer brackish and saline waters (Fig. 3a).",False,False,False,
237,10.1002/lno.12237,26,True,"Subsurface waters were also undersaturated with respect to aragonite while the BCS was open, likely due to increased stratification and increased respiration in the bottom waters (Fig. 5a,e,f). This may have been due to increased nutrient delivery from the rivers that stimulated increased primary productivity (Wurtsbaugh et al. 2019), consuming excess CO 2 in the water column. The observed average and median nutrient concentrations remained relatively low at coastal stations (BCH) throughout the study, with soluble reactive phosphate generally ranging from 0.1 to 2.0 μmol kg À1 , except for September when values ranged from 3.5 to 8.1 μmol kg À1 (Supporting Information Data S1; average of full data set = 1.1 AE 1.5 μmol kg À1 , median = 0.6 μmol kg À1 ). This was also true for BCS stations that ranged from 0.1 to 2.3 μmol kg À1 (Supporting Information Data S1; average = 0.5 AE 0.3 μmol kg À1 ). These low phosphate concentrations may be consistent with consumption from primary producers that are generally phosphorous limited in coastal systems but when supplied with sufficient terrestrial river inputs, or during summer months, become nitrogen limited (Conley et al. 2009;Howarth et al. 2011). Increased respiration in subsurface waters would increase in situ CO 2 through the breakdown of sinking organic material supplied from the surface primary productivity. The hypoxia and stratification in the Sound is likely also exacerbated by the decreased winds during the spring and early summer months in the Mississippi Sound (Parra et al. 2020), seasonally enhanced insolation, as well as due to surface freshening observed in the western Sound that could prevent mixing (Fig. 4b). In addition, previous research has suggested that this region can be influenced by inputs of submarine groundwater (Ho et al. 2019;Sanial et al. 2019). Submarine groundwater could contribute increased nutrients (Rodellas et al. 2015) and low-oxygen water (Peterson et al. 2016;Montiel et al. 2019) to the subsurface waters in the region, both of which could affect local carbonate chemistry. The Ω ar at the westernmost Sound stations did not appear to increase to saturated conditions until approximately 3-4 weeks after the BCS had closed (Fig. 5f). The increase in Ω ar was due to decreased freshwater inputs and decreased hypoxia in subsurface waters throughout the Sound (Figs 4a,5). Therefore, in addition to understanding how large fluxes of freshwater affect local carbonate chemistry throughout the year, it is important to understand when these fluxes occur relative to the oyster spawning season. Climatology of this region has shown that the western Sound is generally fresher than the eastern Sound (Hode 2019) and likely less alkaline. Understanding how multiple stressors (i.e., increases in freshwater, eutrophication, hypoxia) affect coastal acidification in each region is important for informing local stakeholders on how to best conserve these coastal ecosystems that provide fishery and recreational revenue.",False,False,False,
238,10.1002/lno.12237,27,True,"## Conclusion
The contribution of the less alkaline, local rivers in Mississippi and Alabama may leave the Mississippi Sound more susceptible to coastal acidification in fall and winter months. Low TA and Ω ar observations are relevant because they co-occur with the vulnerable period of juvenile oyster maturation. During this study, both TA and Ω ar increased during the summer and early fall months; this was likely due to the large influence of the BCS, which delivered high alkalinity Mississippi River water to the Sound between February and July 2019. Despite the average increase in surface TA and Ω ar values, bottom water Ω ar remained < 2 throughout the summer. This was likely due to hypoxic and elevated pCO 2 conditions driven by freshwater stratification and increased primary productivity in surface waters that enhanced subsurface respiration. Substantial seasonal inputs of Mississippi River water from the BCS could represent a new normal in the Sound's hydrography during spring and summer months, since it has been opened more in the past decade than any previous decade since it was constructed, primarily due to increased rainfall in the watershed driven by climate change (Lindsey 2021). Seasonal fluctuations of TA and Ω ar with the generally low average aragonite saturation states indicate the system is not well buffered to environmental change. Low aragonite saturation will be detrimental to oyster stocks in the Mississippi Sound; thus, it is imperative that we understand the carbon system and the regional environmental stressors that influence the Mississippi Sound ecosystem.Future work in this region could be aimed toward establishing a more permanent time-series data monitoring station near the oyster reefs in the western Sound and in Mobile Bay, similar to the PMEL Coastal Louisiana buoy (Fig. 1a), to measure CO 2 and pH throughout the year. This region could benefit from continued monitoring, as this study was not able to provide summer data without the impacts of this extreme BCS event. In addition, this system is under increasing pressure from increased freshwater inputs, eutrophication, hypoxia, harmful algal blooms and coastal acidification. There is lack of knowledge in how these multiple stressors interact and influence coastal acidification. Therefore, since the Mississippi Sound is impacted by many of these stressors, further research in this region could contribute to predictions of coastal acidification stressors worldwide.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
For spiny lobsters (Palinuridae), the co-occurrence of final-stage larvae (phyllosomata) and postlarvae (pueruli) in sampling stations over oceanic waters is indicative of metamorphosis zones, some of which have been found in boundary currents. We hypothesized that metamorphosis of Panulirus argus and P. guttatus off the Mexican Caribbean coast, which has a very narrow shelf, occurs in the swift Yucatan Current (YC). During two cruises conducted in autumn 2012 and spring 2013, a mid-water trawl and a neuston net were simultaneously towed in night samplings along transects up to ~100 km across the YC. Hydrographic and current fields were derived from Conductivity, Temperature and Depth, and altimetry data. Metamorphosis occurred mainly within the YC core. However, velocity and distance to the coast of the YC varied with cruise, and features that may favor retention (a persistent coastal eddy and a countercurrent) were detected. Despite differences in size and condition of pueruli between cruises, their energy stores did not appear to decline during the shoreward migration, suggesting that metamorphosing within strong boundary currents may increase the chances of pueruli arriving more quickly to a shore. Based on previously reported current features and swimming speeds, pueruli metamorphosing up to 12 km offshore are more likely to reach the Mexican Caribbean coast without much loss of energetic reserves. This could also occur for some pueruli metamorphosing up to 30 km offshore if encountering the features favoring retention. In contrast, pueruli metamorphosing > 30 km offshore are more likely to be carried into the Gulf of Mexico and elsewhere.",False,False,False,

Spiny lobsters (Crustacea: Decapoda: Achelata: Palinuridae) are an important component of tropical and subtropical benthic communities and constitute valuable fishing resources wherever they occur (Briones-Fourz an and Lozano-Alvarez 2013). These lobsters have a peculiar type of planktotrophic larva, known as ""phyllosoma"" (from the Greek ""leaf-shaped body""), which develops in oceanic waters over an exceptionally long period (> 5 months). The lengthy larval duration confers these lobsters a great potential for dispersal (Phillips et al. 2006a). The final phyllosoma undergoes a complete metamorphosis into the postlarva, known as ""puerulus,"" which is morphologically like an adult lobster but is completely transparent. Importantly, pueruli do not feed (Lemmens 1994), that is, they constitute a secondary lecithotrophic phase in the life cycle of spiny lobsters (McWilliam and Phillips 1997). After metamorphosis, the puerulus actively swims toward the shore, where it settles in shallow coastal habitats and begins its benthic life.The Caribbean spiny lobster Panulirus argus (Latreille, 1804) and the spotted spiny lobster Panulirus guttatus (Latreille, 1804) co-occur throughout the wider Caribbean region. The former sustains valuable fisheries across the region, whereas the latter is a much less important resource due to its smaller size and habitat specialization. Although both species reproduce year-round, P. argus exhibits a major reproductive peak in spring and a minor peak in autumn (Padilla-Ramos and *Correspondence: briones@cmarl.unam.mx

248,10.1002/lno.11889,2,True,"Briones-Fourz an 1997), whereas P. guttatus shows a decrease in reproductive activity during late summer (Briones-Fourz an et al. 2013). The larval phase of P. argus comprises 10 phyllosoma stages, with an estimated duration of 5-9 months (Goldstein et al. 2008), and the puerulus of this species is rather small (~6 mm carapace length [CL] on average) (Martínez-Calder on et al. 2018). Upon reaching the shore, the pueruli of P. argus settle in shallow marine vegetated habitats in reef lagoons or shallow bays, where the juveniles remain for several months before migrating to the subadult/adult habitats (coral reefs). In P. guttatus, Baisre and Alfonso (1994) described phyllosoma stages VI to X from wild-caught specimens and considered stage X to be the penultimate stage. Goldstein et al. (2019) cultured P. guttatus larvae from eggs and although they failed to obtain the final phyllosoma (which they considered to be the stage X), they estimated the duration of the complete larval phase in slightly over 1 yr. Compared to P. argus, pueruli of P. guttatus are much larger (~10 mm CL, Briones-Fourz an and McWilliam 1997) and settle directly in the coral reef habitat, where individuals remain for the duration of their benthic life (Briones-Fourz an and Lozano-Alvarez 2013). Because the nonfeeding pueruli have limited energetic reserves (Fitzgibbon et al. 2014), the probability of a puerulus to arrive to the coastal settlement habitats could depend to a great extent on the distance to the coast where it metamorphosed as well as on the local hydrography. Therefore, there has been much debate as to where metamorphosis of spiny lobsters takes place (reviews in Phillips et al. 2006a;Phillips and McWilliam 2009). Catches of phyllosomata metamorphosing into pueruli undoubtedly indicate the location of metamorphosis zones, but such catches are very rare (Yoshimura et al. 1999) because the entire metamorphosis molt takes about 10 min on average (Murakami et al. 2007). Therefore, in general, sea regions in which final phyllosomata and pueruli are found together in the same individual sampling stations have been considered metamorphosis zones. Based on this criterion, several palinurids species have been found to metamorphose in oceanic waters beyond the shelf break (Phillips and McWilliam 2009). Metamorphosis of Panulirus cygnus appears to be related with the Leeuwin Currentan anomalous eastern boundary current of warm, low-salinity water that flows southward along the coast of Western Australia (Griffin et al. 2001;Waite et al. 2007)-but also with the internal margins of anticyclonic eddies, which are frontal zones rich in potential food for phyllosomata (Phillips and McWilliam 2009;Wang et al. 2014). In New Zealand, the distribution of newly metamorphosed pueruli of Jasus edwardsii followed the inshore margins of the Wairarapa eddy fields (Jeffs et al. 2001), adjacent to the stronger southward flow of the East Cape Current (Chiswell and Booth 2005), whereas in Japan, metamorphosis of Panulirus japonicus mainly occurred within the Kuroshio Current, a strong western boundary current (Yoshimura et al. 1999;Sekiguchi and Inoue 2002;Inoue and Sekiguchi 2009). This information strongly suggests that metamorphosis of palinurids is associated with strong boundary currents.",False,False,False,
249,10.1002/lno.11889,3,True,"To our knowledge, no studies have attempted to determine the oceanic zones where metamorphosis of P. argus or P. guttatus occurs. In general, previous studies on the distribution of phyllosomata in the wider Caribbean region have been based on samples obtained in plankton nets of relatively small dimensions (mouth aperture: ≤ 1 m 2 and/or mesh size: 0.33-1 mm) towed at rather low speeds (≤ 0.5 m s À1 ) (Richards and Pothoff 1981;Manzanilla-Domínguez and Gasca 2004;Canto-García et al. 2016). Such nets filter a relatively small volume of water and hence are not adequate to sample late-stage phyllosomata or pueruli, which are highly dispersed in oceanic waters (Phillips et al. 2006a). Also, pueruli are fast swimmers and can avoid slow-moving nets (Phillips and Olsen 1975;Calinski and Lyons 1983;Jeffs et al. 2005). Appropriate sampling of these organisms requires filtering larger volumes of water, for example, using nets of greater dimensions and larger mesh sizes to be towed at faster speeds (> 1 m s À1 ) (Yoshimura et al. 1999;Dennis et al. 2001;Jeffs et al. 2001). Obtaining hydrographic data at the same time as larval sampling can provide further insight into the zones of metamorphosis (Chiswell and Booth 2005;Phillips and McWilliam 2009).",False,False,False,
250,10.1002/lno.11889,4,True,"In the western Caribbean Sea, the Yucatan Current (YC) is a dominant oceanic feature. It is one of the strongest and most dynamically active western boundary currents in the world, with an average velocity of 1 m s À1 and magnitudes of up to 3 m s À1 prior to its passage through the Yucatan strait. This current variability appears to be strongly influenced by the passage of eddies through the region (Candela et al. 2003;Cetina et al. 2006;Carrillo et al. 2015). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that metamorphosis of P. argus and P. guttatus occurs within the YC. For this, we conducted an intensive sampling of late stage phyllosomata and pueruli using nets with large mesh sizes and obtained hydrographic data to determine the location of the current, the cross-section geostrophic flow velocities, and the surface geostrophic current field. For P. argus pueruli, we also quantified several biochemical variables to test for a potential decrease in energy reserves during their shoreward migration.",False,False,False,

## Study area
The study area covered ~30,500 km 2 of oceanic waters off the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, between the Yucatan channel to the north and the Bays of Ascensi on and Espíritu Santo to the south (Fig. 1). This area, located in the western Caribbean Sea, is characterized by the YC, which flows parallel to the shore in a SW-NE direction, and an abrupt bathymetry with depths rapidly falling below 200 m a few kilometers from the shore (Cetina et al. 2006;Carrillo et al. 2015). According to Phillips and McWilliam (2009), metamorphosis of palinurids probably occurs within ~100-150 km of the shelf break; therefore, we established an array of sampling stations following transects perpendicular to the shelf break. Distance of sampling stations to the shore varied from 2 to 100 km over depths ranging between 35 and 2700 m; however, given that the continental shelf is very narrow (< 3 km) along a great part of the coast (Briones-Fourz an et al. 2008), virtually all stations were beyond the shelf break, that is, over depths greater than 200 m (Fig. 1).",False,False,False,

Based on the interannual seasonal settlement pattern of P. argus pueruli which shows a major settlement peak in autumn and a secondary, smaller peak in spring (Briones-Fourz an et al. 2008), we conducted two oceanographic cruises using UNAM's R/V Justo Sierra: one in the autumn of 2012 (14-24 November) and the other one in the spring of 2013 (10-20 April). Hereafter, these cruises will be referred to as the autumn 2012 cruise and the spring 2013 cruise, respectively. In the coastal habitats, settlement of pueruli peaks around the dark phase of the moon (Briones-Fourz an 1994), whereas at sea, late stage phyllosomata and pueruli rise closer to the ocean surface in dark nights (Ritz 1972;Phillips et al. 1978;Bradford et al. 2005). Therefore, both cruises were planned to be carried out during the dark moon phase (i.e., between the dates of the last and first quarters, including the new moon). This was accomplished in the spring cruise, but the autumn cruise was delayed 1 week for reasons beyond our control (a delay in the ship's maintenance schedule) and had to be conducted between the dates of the new moon and the full moon.",False,False,False,

The Tucker trawl was towed from stern at depths of 5-15 m and was fitted with a Sea-Bird SBE39 data logger to record time, depth, and temperature during the tow. The neuston net was towed from starboard approximately mid-ship, within the uppermost meter of the water column. To increase the chances of catching larvae, all larval samplings were done during the hours of darkness (between 1 h after sunset and 1 h before sunrise). The nets were towed against the prevailing current at an average speed of 2.5 knots (1.3 m s À1 ) for 30-35 min to reduce the chances of the fastswimming pueruli (7-10 cm s À1 , Calinski and Lyons 1983) avoiding the nets.",False,False,False,

For P. argus, larvae and postlarvae were identified and staged based on Goldstein et al. (2008). For P. guttatus, phyllosomata were identified and staged based on Baisre and Alfonso (1994), and pueruli were identified based on Briones-Fourz an and McWilliam (1997). To test for seasonal variations in size of pueruli (Martínez-Calder on et al. 2018), all pueruli were individually photographed next to a reference measure under a stereoscopic microscope to estimate their CL using image processing software (ImageJ v.1.49) (Rasband 2015).

To determine the hydrographic conditions and the location of the core of the YC, water temperature ( C) and salinity were measured (to a depth of 500 m) using a Sea-Bird ® SBE9/11Plus CTD system. For operational reasons, CTD profiles were carried out during the day along the same transects in which larval sampling took place during the night, but not necessarily the same stations (Fig. 2). The data processing was based on the standard routines and procedures proposed by the Sea-Bird Electronic Company using the software SEASOFT Win-32. Cross-section geostrophic flow velocities were obtained using hydrographic data referred to the isopycnal sigma-t 27.0 kg m À3 as in Carrillo et al. (2016).## Surface geostrophic current fields
The surface geostrophic current field was derived from satellite-obtained sea surface dynamic altimetry data obtained from the Archiving, Validation, and Interpretation of Satellite Oceanographic data (AVISO) for the periods during which the cruises were conducted. Since currents in areas close to the coast cannot be well resolved using dynamic altimetry data, satellite observations were complemented with direct current observations for filling in the coastal gap where the satellite product is deficient, as well as to validate the satellitederived current product in places further away from the coast. Direct current observations at ~60 m depth were obtained from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers moored at four points along the YC: two of them close to the coast (~15 km) in Chinchorro Channel to the south and Cozumel Channel to the north, and two at a distance of ~50 km from the coast, one to the east of Banco Chinchorro in the south and the other north-eastward of Cozumel Island (black stars in Fig. 2). Even though the direct currents are measured at 60 m depth, the good relationship with satellite derived products Briones-Fourz an et al.Spiny lobster metamorphosis in the Yucatan Current (especially at the two locations distant to the coast) is indicative of the intensity of the current in the upper water column even at appreciable depths.",False,False,False,

Larval counts were standardized to larval density (number per 1000 m 3 ).

Also, the presence of Sargassum in surface waters occasionally resulted in entanglement of the algae in the rotor of the flow meter fitted to the neuston net, precluding its use to calculate the volume of water sampled. Therefore, we discontinued the use of flow meters and estimated the filtered volume (V) with the equation V = D Â A, where D is distance traveled, derived from the ship's speed (m s À1 ) during the tow Â duration of the tow (s), and A = net mouth effective area (9 m 2 for the mid-water trawl, 1 m 2 for the neuston net because approximately onethird of the mouth of the neuston net remained above the ocean surface during the tows.

To test for a potential decrease in energy reserves of pueruli across the full range of distances to the coast of our sampling stations (Phillips et al. 2006b), we subjected 52 pueruli of P. argus from the autumn cruise and 25 from the spring cruise to biochemical analyses. These pueruli were selected from collections obtained in stations spanning the full range of distances, that is, between 99.3 and 2.1 km from the shore. For these analyses, we also included a few transparent pueruli (six in autumn and four in spring) obtained in artificial subsurface collectors deployed about 300 m from the shore (see Fig. 1), to have data from pueruli already settled after having completed their migration from offshore waters. The pueruli were freezedried immediately after collection. Sample processing was as in Espinosa-Magaña et al. (2018). Briefly, pueruli were lyophilized and weighed (dry weight [DW] in mg) at the laboratory. Total lipid (TL) was determined by gravimetry from each lyophilized puerulus using the chloroform/methanol/water extraction technique of Folch et al. (1957), modified by Bligh and Dyer (1959) for small organisms (Jeffs et al. 2001). Total protein (TP) was determined by spectrophotometry using the Micro BCA Protein Assay kit and the Multiskan Spectrum plate reader (Thermo Scientific) based on the bicinchoninic acid determination method for protein (Walker 1994). For all individuals examined, we obtained DW, TL, and TP (the absolute amount of lipid [or protein], in mg, determined for each individual); TL (or TP) percentage (the percentage of lipid [or protein] relative to the DW of each individual), and DW/CL (a morphometric condition factor) (Espinosa-Magaña et al. 2018).

## Hydrographic conditions and geostrophic flow velocities
Temperature and salinity fields for both cruises were analyzed along three transects, one at the northern section (close to the Yucatan Channel), one at the central section (south of Cozumel Island), and one at the southern section of the sampling area (Bahía Espíritu Santo) (Fig. 2). The hydrographic profiles show the upper water masses as defined by Carrillo et al. (2016): Caribbean Surface Water (CSW), North Atlantic Subtropical Underwater (SUW), and Tropical Atlantic Central Water (TACW).The shape of isotherms and isohalines differed along the coast and between cruises (Figs. 3,4,respectively). Upwelling in the northern section was observed, as there was uplifting of the thermocline (Fig. 3a,d), with the SUW reaching a depth of 25 m in autumn 2012 and 20 m in spring 2013. Deeper waters also showed a deeper location of the thermocline at about 100 m. The warmer waters of the CSW were deeper in the central (Fig. 3b,e) and southern sections (Fig. 3c,f) than in the northern section, particularly in the spring cruise. However, in the autumn cruise, the central and southern profiles showed a dome-like shape of the isotherms (Fig. 3c,e), indicating a shallower thermocline (50-75 m). The isohalines (Fig. 4) had a similar shape as the isotherms. In both cruises, the salinity field showed the maximum salinity (> 36.5) in the SUW, with a maximum core offshore, whereas the upper CSW showed some patchiness, with values < 36.1. There was also a reduction in salinity below the SUW, corresponding to the TACW (Fig. 4).",False,False,False,

The YC core was well defined in both cruises. However, there were clear differences between cruises, such as the relative closeness to the coast of the YC coast and the presence of a coastal countercurrent (CC). Also, the location, depth, width, and speed of the YC core and CC varied between cruises and along the coast. In both cruises, the YC core was closer to the coast in the northern section than in the central and southern sections, but in the northern and southern sections it was closer to the coast in the autumn cruise (Fig. 5a,c) than in the spring cruise (Fig. 5d,f). However, during the autumn cruise the southern section (Fig. 5c) was shorter by ~20 km from the one in the spring cruise (Fig. 5f) and could be missing the YC core that appeared to be further offshore based on altimetry (see Fig. 6a-c). If this was the case, then the intense current feature close to the coast along this southern section (Fig. 5c) could be interpreted as a small cyclonic eddy (~50 km in diameter), which is also supported by the domed shaped temperature and salinity distributions along this section (see Figs. 3c, 4c).

However, of the four ADCPs, the one moored in the Cozumel channel measured the strongest velocities, at slightly over 1 m s À1 , consistent with the YC core being closer to the coast during the autumn cruise (see Fig. 5a-c). The presence of the countercurrent south of Cozumel obtained with the geostrophic calculations from the CTD survey (see Fig. 5c) is not registered on this altimetry-deduced flow field, mainly because the CC was close to the coast, where altimetry measurements are not reliable. However, the general pattern of  the YC core being separated from the coast south of Cozumel and closer to shore toward the north is consistent in both data sets and direct current observations (red arrows in Fig. 6a-c).During the spring cruise (Fig. 6d-f), a large anticyclonic/ cyclonic eddy system occurred also to the east of our study area, south of Cuba. Differences in sea surface height were more pronounced during the spring cruise than during the autumn cruise, resulting in stronger geostrophic currents. The ADCP moored off NE Cozumel measured the stronger velocities (~1.5 m s À1 ), consistent with the YC core being farther from the coast during the spring cruise than during the autumn cruise.",False,False,False,

In total, we caught 191 final (gilled) stage phyllosomata and 1170 pueruli in both cruises, mostly belonging to P. argus (96.3% of all final phyllosomata and 94.9% of all pueruli). Most phyllosomata were caught in the autumn cruise, whereas most pueruli were caught in the spring cruise. Also, virtually all pueruli (95.7% of P. argus and 100% of P. guttatus) were caught in the neuston net, whereas virtually all phyllosomata (96.7% of P. argus and 100% of P. guttatus) were caught in the mid-water trawl.

In the autumn cruise, we collected 123 final phyllosomata (stage X) and 127 pueruli of P. argus. Of the 63 sampling stations in this cruise, final phyllosomata were caught in 37 stations (58.7%) throughout the study area, but the highest densities (~0.4 larvae per 1000 m 3 ) were obtained in several stations close to the coast, especially south of Cozumel Island (Fig. 6a). Pueruli of P. argus occurred in 28 of the stations (44.4%), usually at greater densities than phyllosomata, but the highest densities of pueruli (between 2 and 13 postlarvae per 1000 m 3 ) were obtained in stations located in the Yucatan Channel area (Fig. 6b). Both final phyllosomata and pueruli of P. argus co-occurred in 15 of the 63 sampling stations (23.8%) (Fig. 6c). Most of these stations were located very close to the coast in an area south of Cozumel and off Bahía de la Ascensi on (~20 N), but a few were located farther from the coast in the Yucatan Channel area.In the spring cruise, we caught 61 final phyllosomata and 982 pueruli of P. argus. Final phyllosomata appeared in 14 of the 34 sampling stations in this cruise (41.2%), with most individuals concentrated in two offshore stations to the east and south of Cozumel at densities of 0.6 and 1.6 larvae per 1000 m 3 , respectively (Fig. 6d). Pueruli were so abundant in this cruise that they occurred in 33 of the 34 stations (97%) at densities ranging from 0.5 to 37.8 postlarvae per 1000 m 3 , with the highest densities in stations relatively far from the coast (Fig. 6e).

For P. guttatus, catches of final phyllosomata and pueruli were far lower than for P. argus. Prior to our study, the final stage of P. guttatus had not been captured and remained undescribed. Because the P. guttatus larvae were staged based on Baisre and Alfonso (1994), we refer to the final stage as the phyllosoma XI. In the autumn cruise, we caught five finalstage phyllosomata in four of the 63 sampling stations (6.3%); therefore, the densities were quite low (≤ 0.1 larvae per 1000 m 3 ) (Fig. 7a). Twenty-two pueruli of P. guttatus occurred in nine stations (14.3%), with most of the catch (1.3-2.4 postlarvae per 1000 m 3 ) concentrated in three stations close to the Yucatan channel (Fig. 7b). Only two stations yielded both final phyllosomata and pueruli of P. guttatus (Fig. 7c). In the spring cruise, two final phyllosomata of P. guttatus were caught in two of the 34 stations (5.9%) at very low densities (≤ 0.05 larvae per 1000 m 3 ) (Fig. 7d), whereas 38 pueruli were present in 14 stations (41.2%) located mostly south of Cozumel, at densities ranging from 0.5 to 2.1 postlarvae per 1000 m 3 (Fig. 7e).

The size range of pueruli of both species was broad (P. argus: 4.33-7.55 mm CL; P. guttatus: 7.52-11.0 mm CL). In P. argus, size of pueruli differed significantly between cruises (F 1,1093 = 52.019, p < 0.0001), with a smaller value in autumn (mean AE SD: 5.62 AE 0.35 mm CL, n = 114) than in spring (6.01 AE 0.56 mm CL, n = 981). The size of pueruli of P. guttatus varied significantly with cruise as well (F 1,56 = 79.495, p < 0.0001), also showing a smaller value in autumn (mean AE SD: 8.34 AE 0.48 mm CL, n = 20) than in spring (9.68 AE 0.57 mm CL, n = 38).## Energy reserves of pueruli of P. argus
No trend was evident for any of the six biochemical variables measured for pueruli of P. argus across the range of distances to the coast of sampling stations in either cruise (Fig. 8). This was confirmed by results of ANCOVAs, which revealed no significant effect of distance to the coast for any of the six variables (range in p values: 0.174-0.924). However, all six variables differed significantly between cruises. Interestingly, except for percent TP, the mean value of all variables was significantly higher for pueruli collected in the spring cruise (Table 1).",False,True,False,

This is the first study addressing the question of where metamorphosis of P. argus and P. guttatus occurs, and the first to obtain the final, still undescribed phyllosoma stage of P. guttatus. We found an important presence of final stage phyllosomata and pueruli of P. argus and, to a lesser extent, of P. guttatus, in oceanic waters along the Mexican Caribbean up to ~100 km from the shore (the maximum distance to the shore of our transects), but our results confirmed that metamorphosis of both species occurs mainly associated with the YC core.Table 1.

Our sampling design was based on the interannual seasonal pattern of postlarval settlement of P. argus, which shows a major peak in autumn and a minor peak in spring (Briones-Fourz an et al. 2008); therefore, we expected to obtain more final larvae and postlarvae of P. argus in the autumn 2012 cruise than in the spring 2013 cruise. Most final phyllosomata were indeed caught in the former, but far more pueruli were caught in the latter. To our knowledge, the 982 pueruli of P. argus caught in our spring cruise is the largest number of pueruli of any spiny lobster species caught in any one cruise. The majority of pueruli were caught in the neuston net, underlining their tendency to swim in the first few centimeters of the water column in dark nights (Phillips and Olsen 1975;Calinski and Lyons 1983). Therefore, our results may simply reflect the differing moonlight intensity between both cruises, with more brightly moonlit nights in the autumn cruise (conducted between the dates of new moon and full moon) and more dark nights in the spring cruise (conducted between the dates of the last and first lunar quarters). Indeed, the mid-water trawl caught 26% of the 127 pueruli of P. argus obtained in the autumn cruise, but only 4% of the 982 obtained in the spring cruise.",False,True,False,
268,10.1002/lno.11889,22,True,"In other species, most pueruli have also been caught within the first meter of the water column in dark nights (P. cygnus: Phillips et al. 1978; Panulirus ornatus and Panulirus penicillatus: Dennis et al. 2001), but at greater depths in nights with higher illuminance (Phillips et al. 1978;Pearce et al. 1992). Also, rough sea conditions, which further appear to favor the concentration of pueruli in surface waters (Ritz 1972;Phillips et al. 1978), prevailed in both of our cruises, but particularly in the spring cruise. In contrast with P. argus, all pueruli of P. guttatus were caught in the neuston net. Whether this occurrence reflects a difference in behavior between pueruli of P. argus and P. guttatus or the large difference in the catches of pueruli of both species is unknown.",False,False,False,
269,10.1002/lno.11889,23,True,"Unlike pueruli, most final phyllosomata were caught in the mid-water trawl. Only 2 of the 123 final phyllosomata of P. argus from the autumn cruise (1.6%) and 4 of the 63 from the spring cruise (6.4%), but none of the final phyllosomata of P. guttatus, were caught in the neuston net. These results suggest that, even in dark nights, phyllosomata are more dispersed in the water column than pueruli are. Although vertical migrations of phyllosomata, which descend in the water column during the day and ascend at night, potentially modulate their advection (Rimmer and Phillips 1979;Bradford et al. 2005), their eye structure suggests that they spend most of their planktonic life in reasonably well-illuminated regions of the ocean (Mishra et al. 2006). There is no information on how deep the vertical migrations of P. guttatus can go, but in the case of P. argus, few phyllosomata have been found at depths > 100 m, even during the day (Alfonso et al. 1999;Butler et al. 2011), and late stages have been caught mainly in the first 25 m of the water column in dark nights (Austin 1972;Alfonso et al. 1995;Canto-García et al. 2016). Also, phyllosomata of P. argus do not appear to go below the 24 C isotherm (Yeung and McGowan 1991;Alfonso et al. 1999), which in our cruises was generally well above the 100 m isobath. Therefore, for those phyllosomata that are entrained by the swift YC, which is coherent within at least the upper 130 m of the water column (Cetina et al. 2006; the present study), vertical migration is unlikely to modulate their advection.",False,False,False,
270,10.1002/lno.11889,24,True,"The superposition of the sampling stations with cooccurring final phyllosomata and pueruli on the current fields supports our hypothesis that metamorphosis occurs within the YC and is mainly associated with the YC core. In the autumn 2012 cruise, these stations were mostly located south of Cozumel Island and closer to the shore, whereas in the spring 2013 cruise they were mostly located farther from the shore. It is important to underline that the location of the YC core does not follow a fixed seasonal pattern but is rather related with temporal shifts in the latitude of impingement of the Cayman current on the eastern coast of the Yucatan Peninsula, which depends on the size and intensity of mesoscale eddies (both cyclonic and anticyclonic) flowing with the current (Cetina et al. 2006;Carrillo et al. 2015). During both our cruises, interesting circulation features included the CC in the central-southern sections of our study area, which had been inferred by Merino (1986) from information provided by drift cards, and the presence of a cyclonic eddy south of Cozumel Island. This eddy appears to be a persistent feature since it was also observed in June 2000 during a shipboard ADCP survey of the region (Ch avez et al. 2003), and during two oceanographic cruises conducted in March 2006 and January 2007 (Carrillo et al. 2015). The coastal eddy and the CC may aid in the local retention of phyllosomata and the shoreward migration of pueruli (Yeung et al. 2001), as suggested by the location over these features of several sampling stations with both final phyllosomata and pueruli of P. argus in the autumn cruise, and with many pueruli in the spring cruise.",False,False,False,
271,10.1002/lno.11889,25,True,"Relative to the autumn cruise, pueruli of both species were larger in the spring cruise, and those of P. argus were also in a better nutritional condition, as suggested by their higher values of DW, condition index, and TL content. The size and condition of pueruli are known to vary temporally (Yeung et al. 2001;Martínez-Calder on et al. 2018), possibly related to variation in the water temperature throughout the larval development (Matsuda and Yamakawa 1997). Espinosa- Magaña et al. (2018) compared the TL content between a subsample of the final phyllosomata and nektonic pueruli of P. argus collected in our cruises, and the ensuing benthic stages (transparent benthic pueruli, pigmented pueruli, and first juveniles), collected in the shore during the same seasons. They found that the greatest decline in TL occurred between final phyllosomata and nektonic pueruli in autumn, when surface temperatures were significantly higher than in spring, suggesting a greater energy cost of metamorphosis at warmer temperatures, but between nektonic and benthic pueruli in spring, when the YC was stronger, potentially increasing the energy cost of shoreward swimming (Espinosa-Magaña et al. 2018). Differences in size and condition could also reflect variations in the quality and quantity of food. Phyllosomata are omnivorous but prefer gelatinous zooplankton (O'Rorke et al. 2015 and references therein), which tends to be more abundant offshore near shelf breaks (Luo et al. 2014;Greer et al. 2020). Gelatinous zooplankton can accumulate dispersed microbial nutrients and make them available as larger prey for late stage phyllosomata, as suggested by analyses of fatty acids (Wang et al. 2014;Briones-Fourz an et al. 2019). A better nutritional condition could influence the subsequent settlement of pueruli (Wang et al. 2014), but whether survival rates differ between large and small pueruli of a given species has not been determined.",False,False,False,
272,10.1002/lno.11889,26,True,"Irrespective of their size at metamorphosis, the nonfeeding pueruli must use the lipid reserves accumulated as phyllosomata to swim toward the shore (Wilkin and Jeffs 2011). A depletion of the energy stores used to fuel the shoreward migration has been found in pueruli captured inshore compared to those captured offshore in J. edwardsii in New Zealand (Jeffs et al. 1999(Jeffs et al. , 2001) ) and P. cygnus in Australia (Phillips et al. 2006b;Limbourn et al. 2009). We hypothesized that this would also happen in P. argus but, contrary to our expectations, none of the biochemical variables considered for pueruli of P. argus declined during the shoreward migration in either cruise. Briones-Fourz an et al. ( 2019) also did not find significant differences in the fatty acid profiles between nektonic pueruli of P. argus from our autumn 2012 cruise and recently settled pueruli obtained in coastal collectors. Together, these results suggest that, although metamorphosis can occur over the entire range of distances to the shore spanned by our sampling stations, only those pueruli metamorphosing within a portion of that range may make it to the Mexican Caribbean coast.",False,False,False,
273,10.1002/lno.11889,27,True,"Swimming distances and the potential success of the shoreward migration by pueruli are greatly influenced by oceanic forces (Phillips et al. 2006b;Limbourn et al. 2009); therefore, it has been proposed that metamorphosis must occur offshore but close to the shelf break for the pueruli to be able to reach the shore, which would be unlikely if metamorphosis occurs much further offshore (Phillips and McWilliam 2009). In the permanently strong YC (1 m s À1 on average), an embedded particle could be advected 200 km in only 55.5 h; consequently, the passage of these larvae through the region would be expected to be relatively short (~2 d). However, based on data from drift cards released along the Mexican Caribbean, Merino (1986) concluded that although particles in superficial waters at distances ≥ 15 km from the coast would indeed drift along with the swift YC, those at distances ≤ 10 km would tend to drift toward the coast. Moreover, pueruli are not merely drifting particles, but strong swimmers able to swim into or along ocean currents (Phillips and Olsen 1975;Kough et al. 2014). Pueruli of J. edwardsii experimentally swum in a kreisel for 2, 3, or 5 d, alternated between extended periods of swimming at the speed of the current and drifting with the water flow. Interestingly, the TL of pueruli swum for 2 d did not differ significantly from that of a control group, whereas the TL of pueruli swum for 3 and 5 d was significantly lower (García-Echauri and Jeffs 2018).",False,False,False,
274,10.1002/lno.11889,28,True,"Pueruli of P. argus swimming in circular floating arenas deployed in the sea off the Florida coast (U.S.A.) were observed to swim directionally day and night. They swam with the current, which ran parallel to the coast (as the YC does), but oriented relative to the tide flow and the wind in such a way as to place them on a shoreward trajectory (Kough et al. 2014). This orientation ability, while swimming at a speed of 7-10 cm s À1 (as measured by Calinski and Lyons 1983), could allow pueruli of P. argus metamorphosing within ~12 km from the eastern Yucatan coast to reach the settlement habitats in a few hours to less than 2 d without a significant loss of energy reserves (García-Echauri and Jeffs 2018), as found in our study. Even some pueruli metamorphosing farther than 12 km from the coast may be helped in their shoreward migration if encountering favorable flow features, such as the persistent coastal eddy south of Cozumel, which extends to around 20 km from the coast (Carrillo et al. 2015), as well as the CC in the central and southern sections of our study area, which extended to 30 km from the coast in our autumn cruise. The onshore transport of pueruli can be further enhanced by the dominant trade winds, which blow toward the coast, and by large waves generated by extreme weather events (Caputi and Brown 1993;Briones-Fourz an et al. 2008). In contrast, pueruli metamorphosing farther away than 30 km from this coast or closer to the Yucatan Channel are more likely to be carried by the swift YC into the Gulf of Mexico, riding on the Loop Current, and potentially settle elsewhere, for example, along the Florida Keys or the Cuban coast (Merino 1986;Lara-Hern andez et al. 2019;Segura-García et al. 2019). Others might enter the eddy system east of the YC, eventually reaching the southern coast of Cuba or recirculating within the eddies (Martín et al. 2017), and others would undoubtedly be lost due to exhausted energetic reserves and a declining swimming response with increasing pueruli age (Wilkin and Jeffs 2011;Fitzgibbon et al. 2014).",False,False,False,
275,10.1002/lno.11889,29,True,"Building upon earlier studies on different spiny lobster species, our study increased insight into the oceanic zones where metamorphosis of spiny lobsters may occur. Our results suggest that metamorphosing within strong boundary currents, which by definition are determined by the presence of a coastline, may increase the chances of pueruli arriving more quickly to a shore. However, settlement of pueruli in the coastal habitats is known to vary broadly in time (reviewed in Phillips et al. 2006a). In the case of the Mexican Caribbean coast, our results further suggest that the intra-and interannual variation in settlement of P. argus postlarvae (Briones-Fourz an et al. 2008) may be partially underlain by the variability in the velocity and location of the YC core, the associated CC, and the coastal eddy.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Coral populations from reef habitats that experience extreme daily abiotic fluctuations have been suggested as candidates to survive and proliferate under future climate change. Few studies, however, have exposed corals from dynamic environments to the synergistic effects of ocean warming and acidification to investigate whether tolerance of present-day environmental variability is maintained under future climate stress. This study assessed the impact of RCP2.6 (+0.8 C and +25 ppm) and RCP4.5 (+1.3 C and +66 ppm) ocean warming and acidification on the survivorship, primary calcification (i.e., extension), secondary calcification (i.e., densification), and protein densities of Isopora palifera originating from two distinct reef habitats (abiotically variable reef flat vs. stable reef slope) over 9 weeks. Temperature and pCO 2 were offset from a reef slope baseline temperature of 26.0 C AE 0.6 C and pCO 2 concentration of 559 AE 56 ppm, incorporating natural diurnal variability. A trade-off was observed in I. palifera originating from the reef flat, which significantly increased tissue protein densities but reduced densification relative to corals from the reef slope. Survivorship nor extension rates differed between corals originating from the variable or stable reef habitats. Mortality increased under RCP4.5 as extension rates increased, indicating that energetic investment in skeletal expansion becomes unsustainable under future climate stress. Increasing temperature and CO 2 reduced calcification rates irrespective of the corals originating reef habitat suggesting with future climate change, exposure to greater environmental variability may not benefit coral calcification. These results demonstrate that tolerance to present-day abiotic variability does not necessarily infer resilience to moderate future ocean warming and acidification conditions.",False,False,False,

Climate change imposes a profound threat to coral reef resilience as increases in ocean warming and acidification combine to cause frequent acute disturbances with impeded recovery trajectories. The resilience of a coral reef may be described as both resistance against disturbance induced degradation and the ability and speed at which the reef returns to its predisturbance state. Presently, acute disturbances are observed as impacts from cyclonic activity, which physically destroy reef structures, and marine heatwaves which cause mass coral bleaching, tissue mortality, and the rapid decay of exposed skeletons (Hughes et al. 2017;Leggat et al. 2019). Recovery from future disturbances will be dependent on the ability of the reef to return to a hard coral-dominated community and scleractinian corals to replace calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) frameworks lost to acidification and erosion at a rate that exceeds the frequency of disturbance-related degradation (Eyre et al. 2018;Ortiz et al. 2018;Kline et al. 2019). By rebuilding reef frameworks, coral colonies contribute to integral economic and ecological reef services including providing physical protection to coastal communities and rugose habitats that support high biodiversity (Andersson and Gledhill 2013).",True,False,False,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **coral reefs**.

284,10.1002/lno.11991,2,True,"The abiotic conditions of the future are linked to anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. Projections of future emission scenarios are categorized as representative concentration pathways (RCP) defined by the change in radiative forcing (Wm À2 ) between 1900 and 2100 (IPCC 2014). Under high (2.6 Wm À2 ) and moderate (4.5 Wm À2 ) levels of CO 2 mitigation, expected increases in mean global sea surface temperature (SST) by mid to late century are 0.71 C AE 0.45 C and 1.28 C AE 0.56 C, which are each associated with mean changes in sea surface pH of À0.07 (+84 ppm CO 2 ) and À0.15 (+184 ppm CO 2 ) units, respectively (Bopp et al. 2013). Projections for thermal impacts are based on the intensity and persistence of an anomaly which accumulates above a regionally sensitive threshold temperature. The maximum monthly mean (MMM) SST (determined biweekly via satellite data collected between 1985 and 1993) +1 C has served as an effective threshold for determining the likelihood of a mass bleaching event especially when the intensity of the anomaly is multiplied by its longevity to form the concept of a degree heating week (DHW). Mortality under warming is less predictable, but fast-growing staghorn and tabular corals appear to be more susceptible to prolonged heat exposures (DHW > 4) than corals with thicker tissues that tend to have slower extension rates (Eakin et al. 2010). Above eight DHW, extensive mortality typically occurs across most coral taxa (Eakin et al. 2010;Hughes et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
285,10.1002/lno.11991,3,True,"In the past, spring and early summer conditions have been associated with maximal periods of coral recovery following significant coral die-back (Diaz-Pulido et al. 2009). Performing experiments in this period therefore presents an opportunity to assess how coral calcification, in what should be the recovery periods of the future, is impacted under different scenarios when accompanied with ocean acidification. Calcification in corals involves two processes: expansion of the skeletal structure (primary calcification) and densification of existing structure (secondary calcification). Below threshold increases in temperature can increase coral extension rates (Anderson et al. 2017). Reduced calcification rates caused by ocean acidification often eventuate as reduced skeletal density rather than changes to skeletal expansion (Madin et al. 2012;Fantazzini et al. 2015;Tambutté et al. 2015), highlighting the potential decoupling between the two processes (primary calcification/extension vs. secondary calcification/densification) (Gladfeiter 1982). Reductions in skeletal density increase the susceptibility of deposited CaCO 3 to physical and biological erosion, such that rates of extension observable in a laboratory setting may not be realized in the field. Alternatively, at more protected reef locations, rapidly extending corals that sacrifice densification for growth would be highly sensitive to any projected increases in storm activity (Knutson et al. 2020).",False,False,False,
286,10.1002/lno.11991,4,True,"To promote reef resilience under future climate conditions, corals of the future will need to calcify rapidly in cooler periods and survive through abnormally warm periods. Survival through past warming events is linked to hard corals that demonstrate reduced extension rates and greater tissue development (Glynn 1984). Likewise, corals persisting in abiotically variable environments often have thicker tissues (Salih et al. 1998;Thornhill et al. 2011), providing greater energy reserves to cope with high environmental stress (Grottoli et al. 2014;Schoepf et al. 2015). Selective pressures on coral growth require corals to display intraspecific differences in physiology depending on the abiotic conditions of their environment. Tidal ponding in shallow lagoon reefs can expose corals to high variability in seawater temperature and carbonate chemistry, conditions which are moderated on deeper reef slopes through greater water mixing and lower irradiance (Rivest et al. 2017;Cyronak et al. 2020). Rapidly growing corals contribute significantly to maintaining reef frameworks (Brown et al. 2021), however at the cost of greater environmental sensitivity because of their thinner tissues (Loya et al. 2001;Grottoli et al. 2014). It has thus been proposed that corals residing in naturally variable habitats may be more tolerant to future climate conditions and could provide population stocks for future reef management (Camp et al. 2017(Camp et al. , 2019)). Corals from the variable environment, however, can exhibit lower rates of calcification relative to conspecifics from the stable environment (Denis et al. 2013;Camp et al. 2016). Shifting from calcification to protein is clearly beneficial when corals approach their physiological thresholds and are lacking in energy resources (Denis et al. 2013;Tambutté et al. 2015;Camp et al. 2016). However, such a compromise may not be sufficient for corals to survive prolonged environmental driven resource limitations. In this respect, present evidence suggests that corals with the thickest tissues are nonetheless failing to survive extreme marine heatwaves (Hughes et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
287,10.1002/lno.11991,5,True,"Persistence of corals in abiotically variable environments suggests some coral populations have locally adapted or acclimated to conditions that exceed regional stress thresholds (Bongaerts et al. 2010;Rivest et al. 2017). Corals from high variability niches have been found to exhibit greater tolerance to elevated temperature (Oliver and Palumbi 2011;Palumbi et al. 2014;Schoepf et al. 2015) and ocean acidification stress (Dufault et al. 2012;Comeau et al. 2014). Consequently, corals from variable environments have been proposed as candidates to acclimate to future climate conditions over their lifetime. Greater thermal tolerance in corals from highly variable environments has been evidenced by reduced mortality and/or bleaching, maintained photosynthetic efficiency and greater tissue biomass (Oliver and Palumbi 2011;Thornhill et al. 2011;Schoepf et al. 2015). However, most studies that have explored the concept of enhanced abiotic tolerance in corals from naturally variable environments have investigated elevated temperature and pCO 2 in isolation or under presentday in situ conditions. This raises the question of whether any physiological tolerance observed is maintained under the interactive effects of projected ocean warming and acidification. Alternatively, corals exposed to high variability may be nearing their physiological thresholds (Schoepf et al. 2015;Rivest et al. 2017) and exhibit a trade-off between survival and growth (Okazaki et al. 2013). As such, the ability of coral colonies to tolerate elevated environmental stress is not necessarily analogous or scalable to resilience of entire reef systems. Physiological trade-offs made by corals to persist in abiotically stressful environments may impact their contribution to reef resilience by reducing their rates of positive reef accretion.",False,False,False,

Specifically, we investigated whether I. palifera originating from variable (reef flat) and stable (reef slope) environments exhibit a physiological trade-off between calcification (surface area [SA] extension and/or densification) and tissue protein production under future climate scenarios. On the reef flat (mean depth ~2 m) of Heron Island, tidal fluctuations in water depth cause intense diel variation in temperature, irradiance, and water carbonate chemistry (Georgiou et al. 2015;Brown et al. 2018), with limited exposure to mechanical forces (Harris and Vila-Concejo 2013). On the reef slope (mean depth ~5-8 m), lower irradiance and high flow rates provide stable abiotic conditions with minimal diel variability (Brown et al. 2018;Cyronak et al. 2020). Corals originating from the variable reef flat were predicted to increase their tissue protein reserves more than reef slope conspecifics but exhibit decreased rates of calcification. Habitat dependent differences in I. palifera survivorship were also explored across climate treatments. Given the timing of the experiment in late spring/early summer and the experimental offsets applied, it was hypothesized that mortality would only be observed under RCP4.5 toward the end of the experiment. Exploring climate-driven survivorship and physiological changes in I. palifera from distinct reef habitats provides insight into how origin dependent trade-offs may influence coral survival and the contribution of corals to reef resilience under future climate change.",False,False,False,

To explore variance in environmental conditions between the reef flat and reef slope, daytime photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and seawater temperature were recorded continuously at two sites within the reef slope and three sites within the reef flat of Heron Reef (Table 1; Figs. 2, S1). In-field measurements were recorded concurrently with the manipulative experiment (01 November 2019-02 January 2020), and within the same area coral collections took place (Figs. 1, S1).

Temperature and pCO 2 conditions were manipulated using a flow-through ocean warming and acidification simulation system, described in detail by Dove et al. (2013). Briefly, this system was comprised of three treatment sumps that continuously drew seawater from the Heron Island reef flat via the Heron Island Research Station holding tank (Fig. S2). Very large sumps (10,000 liters) maintained in the dark combined with high flow rates were used to effectively eliminate any interaction between the sump walls and the bulk of the water that passes through them (i.e., differential confinement effects) (Schoepf et al. 2013;Cornwall and Hurd 2015). Diel variation of temperature and pCO 2 were controlled to simulate natural variation in bi-hourly measurements recorded at the Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) MAPCO 2 ocean observation buoy near Harry's Bommie (https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/co2/story/Heron+Island) in 2013. Conditions in each sump were manipulated using a computer-controlled feedback system that responded to conditions measured in experimental aquaria (SCIWARE Software Solutions) by injection of air enriched to 30% CO 2 or CO 2 -free air (Spherasorb soda lime, Intersurgical) and the use of industrial-scale heater chillers (Rheem HWPO17-IBB; Accent Air equipped with Eurotherm 3216 temperature regulators, Invensys Process Systems and CO 2 -Pro CO 2 regulators, Pro-Oceanus with an accuracy of AE 0.5% CO 2 concentration). Sump, as opposed to tank, pCO 2 was controlled and monitored to allow organisms and their biology to influence intank pCO 2 . Manipulated treatment seawater was then pumped from the sumps into experimental tanks (Fig. S2). Within the tanks, seawater pH was measured at 08:00 and 20:00 h daily using a pHep sensor (HI 98128, Hanna Instruments), calibrated every other day (pH sw buffers 4.00 and 10.00) (Table 1). Three tanks per treatment were randomly selected for pH measurements on each sampling occasion.",False,True,False,

In the first week of acclimation, temperature, and pCO 2 were maintained at present-day treatment levels across all tanks (Fig. 1). Over the following 2 weeks, temperature and pCO 2 were increased at quarter increments to treatment levels (Fig. 1). Exposure of corals to full treatment conditions occurred for 6 weeks. During the experiment water flow rates were maintained between 1.0 and 1.6 L min À1 and wavemakers (Nano 900, Hydor) continuously circulated tank water. Seawater temperature (HOBO pendant logger) and PAR (Odyssey PAR sensor) were continuously measured in each treatment by randomly rotating two probes per treatment between tanks (Table 1; Fig. 2).A total of 24 experimental tanks (n = 8 per treatment) were randomized across two outdoor tables (Fig. S3) and evenly spaced to minimize light variability. Tanks and lids were covered with filters (Marine Blue #131, Lee Filters) to mimic the light environment of the reef slope collection site (Dove et al. 2020) (Table 1). Six coral nubbins, ramets from distinct colonies, from the same habitat were randomly suspended using nylon fishing line from a bamboo stick, with two bamboo sticks (one from each habitat) placed in each tank. Each bamboo stick was considered a cohort, with each cohort rotated into an adjacent tank of the same treatment every third day (Fig. S3). This was done to minimize any effects of environmental differences between tanks. ""Cohort,"" rather than ""tank,"" therefore represents the random effect within this experimental design.

Mortality of corals was tracked throughout the experiment and defined as 100% tissue mortality (Fig. 3). Coral nubbins were measured for their BW and living tissue SA three times throughout the experiment: (1) at the end of acclimation, (2) after 4 weeks of exposure to full treatment conditions (beginning 22 November 2019), and (3) after 6 weeks of exposure to full treatment conditions (beginning 15 December 2019) (Fig. 1). It took ~2 weeks to collect the BW and SA data, but there is no overlap between sampling periods as the order in which organisms were sampled meant that there was equal time between sampling for each cohort. The BW method was used to assess net calcification (Davies 1989), as it incorporates the rate of coral calcification and bioerosion by internal bioeroders. BW was not adjusted to a dry-weight equivalence as this assumes a skeletal density (Comeau et al. 2014). Instead, the change in living SA was adopted as a proxy for coral extension (primary calcification). Changes in BW for statistically fixed SA changes was adopted as a proxy for change in skeletal density (secondary calcification), driven either by reduced coral densification or increased skeletal erosion. Living tissue SA was estimated from photographs of the left-and right-hand side (LHS and RHS) and bottom surface of each coral, using image processing software ImageJ (National Institute of Health) (Fig. S6). The relative changes in coral BW and living tissue SA were calculated over each sampling period (Fig. 1). Relative change accounts for size-dependent differences in coral growth rates, by standardizing increases in growth as a percentage of the corals initial BW or SA. Growth changes were also standardized to the number of days between sampling for each coral cohort.

Coral survivorship was influenced by the individual effects of treatment (χ 2 = 14.56, p < 0.0007) and sampling period (χ 2 = 7.35, p = 0.007) (Table S1). Coral nubbins exposed to RCP4.5 treatment conditions experienced a 21% and 15% increased risk of mortality relative to PD and RCP2.6 treatments, respectively (Table S5). Nubbin mortality risk was additionally 15% greater in sampling period B than period A (Table S5). Approximately 19% of the variation in nubbin survival was explained by the fixed effects of treatment and period, with reef habitat nonsignificant and eliminated as a predictor from the best fit model (Tables S1, S5).Following the removal of dead nubbins from the data, coral extension (% ΔSA d À1 ) was best explained by a model that included the interaction between treatment and period (χ 2 = 6.96, p = 0.036) (Tables S1, S6). Extension rates were equivalent (~0.35% d À1 ) among treatments in period A but increased to ~0.58% d À1 with increasing temperatures in period B (PD < RCP4.5) (Figs. 3, S6). Again, reef habitat did not add any explanatory power to this model and observations of greater surface areal expansion in living corals correlated with an increase in mortality risk in Period B under RCP4.5 (Fig. 3; Tables S1, S6).",False,True,False,
302,10.1002/lno.11991,20,True,"There was no habitat difference in the SA of initial samples collected from the field and trimmed to size (t-test, p = 0.69), but the BW differed (t-test, p < 0.02), with reef flat corals having a reduced BW/SA ratio relative to reef-slope native corals. The best fit model for variance in BW (%ΔBW d À1 ) included the covariates origin (χ 2 = 23.77, p < 0.0001), SA (%Δ SA d À1 ) (χ 2 = 43.58, p < 0.0001), and the interaction between treatment and sampling period (χ 2 = 25.30, p < 0.0001) (Tables S1, S7). Post hoc analyses revealed corals originating from the reef flat densified significantly less than those native to the reef slope (for an extension rate fixed at 0.43% d À1 ) and incurred a further reduction in skeletal density under RCP4.5 in sampling period B compared to PD and RCP2.6 treatments (χ 2 = 25.30, p < 0.0001). This model explained 30% of the variance (Table S7). The specific effects of mean temperature and mean pCO 2 between sampling time points were also examined by substituting continuous abiotic variables for the categorical predictor of treatment (Table S1). This model explained 35% of the variance in secondary calcification rates, with %ΔSA d À1 (χ 2 = 25.66, p < 0.0001) and reef habitat (χ 2 = 21.93, p = 0.0001) maintaining their statistical significance, together with the interaction between mean temperature and mean pCO 2 (χ 2 = 22.39, p < 0.0001) (Fig. 4; Tables S1, S8). The positive relationship found between changes in BW and SA supported the assumption that increases in living SA coincide with increased CaCO 3 contributions to skeletal extension (Fig. 4b). The gradient of %(ΔBW) d À1 to %(ΔSA) d À1 was 0.0079 AE 0.0016 suggesting that over Period A coral extension added ~0.003%(ΔBW) d À1 but that over Period B and under RCP4.5, extension added ~0.005%(ΔBW) d À1 . At mean pCO 2 concentrations of 530 ppm, increasing temperature from 25.5 C to 27.5 C had little effect on skeletal density, but as mean pCO 2 increased to 680 ppm, there was a decrease in density that was equivalent to ~0.015%(ΔBW) d À1 C À1 when corals extended at equivalent rates (Fig. 4c). At 27.5 C and 680 ppm, reef flat and reef slope corals are therefore contributing 1.2-fold (0.006 : 0.005) or 2.6-fold (0.013 : 0.005) more CaCO 3 to densification than to extension, respectively.",False,True,False,

Relative to these initial values and irrespective of coral extension rates, protein densities only increased in corals from the reef flat with the greatest increase occurring in the RCP4.5 treatment (Treatment Â Habitat: χ 2 = 7.37, p < 0.03; reef slope all < reef flat PD < reef flat RCP4.5 ) (Tables S1, S10).

This study investigated whether pre-exposure to high abiotic variability in I. palifera infers tolerance to future, albeit mitigated, ocean warming, and acidification conditions. Evidence of an origin dependent physiological trade-off between secondary calcification and tissue protein production was found in I. palifera originating from the highly variable reef flat environment. Reef flat corals densified their skeletons at a slower rate, but increased their tissue protein densities significantly more than reef slope conspecifics, irrespective of climate treatment. Previous literature suggests increased tissue mass facilitates coral survival under environmental stress (Thornhill et al. 2011;Okazaki et al. 2013;Schoepf et al. 2015). In this study, despite increasing protein densities, reef flat I. palifera did not experience greater survivorship to future temperature and pCO 2 conditions. This result does not support the theory that exposure to present-day variability preconditions corals to tolerate future climate change. Coral mortality correlated with increased rates of extension, as opposed to increases in protein densities, supporting the observation that future reefs may transition to slow-growing coral communities. Our results also indicate that increasing mean temperatures (up to 27.5 C) acted synergistically with increasing CO 2 (up to 680 ppm), significantly impacting secondary calcification rates of I. palifera. As climate conditions elevate toward RCP4.5, our findings suggest corals will experience greater mortality, irrespective of native habitat, and surviving corals originating from variable habitats will have weaker skeletons despite the outward appearance that calcification is unaffected.",False,False,False,
305,10.1002/lno.11991,23,True,"In this study, we did not find support for the concept of climate pre-conditioning in corals by exposure to present-day variability. Increased mortality was observed in conjunction with RCP4.5 conditions at the maximum exposure of 6 weeks, regardless of whether corals originated from the highly variable reef flat or comparatively stable reef slope. As mortality increased, late experiment RCP4.5 conditions also led to 1.6-fold increase in SA expansion rates for surviving coral nubbins irrespective of habitat origin-an expansion that has previously been observed in corals responding to thermal increases within their physiological range (Anderson et al. 2017). Rapid skeletal expansion requires energetic investment in new skeleton and tissue which can become a liability in environments where energy acquisition is impeded (Anthony et al. 2008). The coincidence of high mortality with increased coral extension rates is in line with observations of community shifts following intense underwater heatwaves to slow growing species (Glynn 1984;Eakin et al. 2010;Hughes et al. 2018). Typically, survival is attributed to greater tissue biomass and resource availability (Grottoli et al. 2014), but energetically, corals with reduced expansion rates can maintain tissue biomass.",False,False,False,
306,10.1002/lno.11991,24,True,"The experimental conditions released nubbins from space limitations that potentially inhibit reef flat coral expansion in the field (Chen et al. 2018). Despite no difference in nubbin survival or extension rates, conspecifics did not converge on the same physiological responses to their new experimental regimes. Rather, corals native to the reef flat responded in a manner that suggests that they were at, or past, their physiological limits with tissue biomass favored over skeletal biomass (Okazaki et al. 2013). By contrast, corals native to the reef slope maintained an unchanging protein density and a greater densification rate for the same growth rate, suggesting that for much of the experiment they were not subject to energy limitations. The physiological status of corals in October when they were collected from the field was different to expectations. Previous work suggests that corals native to the variable habitats should have greater tissue biomass (Oliver and Palumbi 2011;Denis et al. 2013;Schoepf et al. 2015). However, initial protein densities (and skeletal densities) were significant less in I. palifera reef flat populations, despite their experimental tendency to add protein biomass with increased levels of warming. Schoepf et al. (2015) interpret an observation of reduced tissue biomass in Acropora in heat stressed intertidal (variable) vs. subtidal (stable) natives as a greater ability to access energy reserves. In this context, I. palifera from the reef flat may always be operating under an energy deficit. Indeed, mass coral bleaching (> 60% of corals) was observed on the Heron Island reef flat 1 month following the completion of this study in February 2020 (Ainsworth et al. 2021). Given the timing of the experiment in late spring/early summer and the experimental offsets applied, coral bleaching was minimal; however, measurements of bleaching metrics (e.g., symbiont densities) to determine if the experimental treatments led to any significant changes in symbiont community and physiology could be incorporated into future studies.",False,False,False,
307,10.1002/lno.11991,25,True,"By end of experiment, under RCP4.5 mean experimental conditions, I. palifera had replenished tissue biomass to levels present in corals native to the reef slope across all treatment. This replenishment did not lead to greater thermal tolerance to upper quartile stress (7.25 Q3 DHW) under RCP4.5 by end of experiment. In contrast, Oliver and Palumbi (2011) found corals from abiotically variable lagoon pools experienced lower mortality (17%) compared to corals from abiotically moderate pools (50%) when exposed to temperatures 2.2 C above Ofu, American Samoa MMM for 4-5 d (≤ 1 mean DHW, or estimated Q3 DHW < 3 based on Q3 anomaly of +3.2 C in heat treatment). Similarly, corals from variable intertidal habitats experienced 50-58% mortality, relative to 75% mortality in stable subtidal corals, when exposed to temperatures 2-3 C above long-term mean summer SST (~1.5 C above MMM + 1; estimated < 2.4 mean DHW) (Schoepf et al. 2015). In these previous experiments, corals were exposed to high temperatures for 4-5 (Oliver and Palumbi 2011) and 11 d (Schoepf et al. 2015). Potentially, such treatments are more akin to a relatively sudden (acute) temperature shock that more closely mirrors sudden exposure to ponding temperatures over very low tidal cycles rather than gradual stress that are allowed to accumulate slowly as spring transitions to summer under future scenarios. For shorter periods of stress, tissue biomass provides a finite reservoir of energy that is unlikely to last over longer periods. Another confounding factor is the interactive effects of elevated temperature and CO 2 on coral survivorship. While Oliver and Palumbi (2011) and Schoepf et al. (2015) did not investigate elevated temperature and CO 2 in combination, ocean acidification has been found to act synergistical with warming to lower corals stress thresholds (Anthony et al. 2008;Dove et al. 2013;Dove et al. 2020), potentially by increasing respiratory demands on the host (Kaniewska et al. 2015). The synergistic effects of high temperature and CO 2 conditions in this study may account for the lack of difference in survival between corals pre-exposed to environmental stress and corals lacking a stressful environmental history. However, the most likely explanation is that preconditioning to SST flux (hours to days) does not equip corals to survive chronic thermal stress (weeks to months) associated with climate change.",False,False,False,
308,10.1002/lno.11991,26,True,"Reduced secondary calcification rates under RCP4.5 conditions during the second sampling period was attributed to the significant interaction of temperature and CO 2 on calcification. This is significant as some laboratory studies have suggested that CO 2 variability may mitigate the impacts of ocean acidification (Dufault et al. 2012;Comeau et al. 2014;Enochs et al. 2018). However, in most of these previous studies, the mitigating effect of variability on ocean acidification was relative to constant exposure to high CO 2 (Dufault et al. 2012;Comeau et al. 2014;Enochs et al. 2018). In our study, the interaction of naturally variable temperature and pCO 2 negatively impacted coral calcification rates (Fig. 4). Similar observations were made in Reynaud et al. (2003), where calcification rates of Stylophora pistillata were maintained at elevated temperatures (28.2 C) but declined by 50% with exposure to high pCO 2 (800 μatm). Anthony et al. (2008) also found Acropora intermedia exposed to warm (28-29 C), intermediate CO 2 (520-700 ppm) conditions had a 30% increase in productivity relative to the control (25-26 C and 380 ppm), whereas warm, high CO 2 (1000-1300 ppm) conditions resulted in declined productivity. Overall, these findings suggest that in isolation, increases in temperature below a region's thermal threshold conditions may even benefit coral calcification and expansion; however, synergistically even moderate increases in temperature and CO 2 conditions may significantly reduce calcification rates.",False,False,False,
309,10.1002/lno.11991,27,True,"The results of this study have provided evidence of physiological trade-offs in I. palifera dependent on the abiotic conditions of their native environment and have illustrated the potential for moderate increases over environmental thresholds to negatively impact calcification in I. palifera. Corals pre-exposed to high abiotic variability exhibited equivalent rates of mortality under future climate conditions. Our findings did not support the theory that pre-exposure to natural variability preconditions corals to tolerate future climate change. Relatively high rates of survival in I. palifera observed here may be attributed to the corals slow growth rate or moderate climate treatments investigated. Even though our study spanned 9 weeks, future studies could be conducted over longer time frames, during peak heat stress (mid to late summer), and across reef habitats to better understand the interactive effects of chronic climate stress on top of short-term variability on coral physiology and future reef accretion. Reduced densification in I. palifera from variable reef flat habitats relative to reef slope may be a result of reef flat corals prioritizing tissue protein production in order to survive a highly stressful environment. This suggests that corals originating from variable environments may be better survivors within reef habitats with limited variability (e.g., reef slopes), however, at a cost to skeletal density. Irrespective of reef habitat, however, the capacity for corals to survive and maintain high rates of calcification will be reduced with moderate ocean warming and acidification.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
The California Current System is a diatom-dominated region characterized by seasonal coastal upwelling and additional elevated mesoscale activity. Cyclonic mesoscale eddies in the region trap productive coastal waters with their planktonic communities and transport them offshore with limited interaction with surrounding waters, effectively acting as natural mesocosms, where phytoplankton populations undergo ecological succession as eddies age. This study examines diatom community composition within two mesoscale cyclonic eddies that formed in the same region of the California Current System 2 months apart and in the California Current waters surrounding them. The diatom communities were analyzed in the context of shifting environmental gradients and through a lens of community succession to expand our understanding of biophysical interactions in California Current System cyclonic eddies. Diatom communities within each eddy were different from noneddy communities and varied in concert with salinity and dissolved iron (Fe) concentrations. The younger, nearshore eddy displayed higher macronutrient and dissolved Fe concentrations, had higher values for diatom Shannon diversity and evenness, and had nutrient ratios indicative of either eventual silicic acid (Si) or Fe limitation or possibly co-limitation. The older, offshore eddy displayed low macronutrient and dissolved Fe concentrations, was likely nitrate-limited, and had lower diatom Shannon diversity and evenness indices. Sequences from the genus Rhizosolenia, some of which form vertically migrating mats to bypass nitrate limitation, dominated in the older eddy. This is of potential significance as the prevalence of Rhizosolenia mats could impact estimates of carbon cycling and export in the wider California coastal area.",False,False,False,

As a region with elevated mesoscale activity, including extensive seasonal coastal upwelling resulting in frequent delivery of nutrients to the surface ocean, the California Current System is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world (Capone and Hutchins 2013). In many areas of the California Current System, silicic acid (Si) concentrations far exceed dissolved nitrogen (nitrate + nitrite, N) concentrations, allowing for a diatom-dominated phytoplankton community (Hood et al. 1990;Venrick 2009). Diatoms are unicellular eukaryotes that contribute $ 25% of the global primary production, and $ 40% of the primary production in the oceans (Round et al. 1990;Sumper and Brunner 2006). Because of their cellular structure, diatoms have an obligate Si requirement and are known to dominate phytoplankton communities in waters with elevated Si:N ratios, where they are important contributors to primary production and carbon (C) export (Sommer 1994;Dugdale et al. 1995;Smetacek 1999). Diatoms are the most abundant and diverse of eukaryotic marine phytoplankton groups, and their productivity is believed to significantly control fixed C availability for other trophic levels (Falkowski et al. 1998;Kooistra et al. 2007;Lewitus et al. 2018). The flux of organic C from sinking diatom blooms fuels the ""biological C pump"" that exports atmospheric C to the ocean interior (Smetacek 1999). Nutrient-rich coastal waters in the California Current System are home to elevated proportions of large diatoms (Hood et al. 1990).*Correspondence: pdchappe@odu.edu

As diatom community composition is known to influence the magnitude of C export by varying Si:C ratios, cell size, and morphology (Treguer et al. 2018 and references therein), it is important to understand how diatom communities respond to environmental forcing.",False,False,False,
319,10.1002/lno.12224,3,True,"The California Current System is characterized by a collection of currents, up/downwelling, and mesoscale activity typical of eastern boundary upwelling systems (Kurian et al. 2011;Combes et al. 2013). Upwelling events in such systems are known to be especially productive (Cushing 1971;Iles et al. 2012). Because of the elevated frequency of nutrient delivery due to these upwelling events, eastern boundary upwelling systems can support both larger abundances of phytoplankton biomass (blooms) and larger phytoplankton cells than other regions of the ocean, and reportedly support 50% of global fish production (Hood et al. 1990). This is in contrast to open ocean regions, which have lower frequencies of nutrient delivery, are commonly in a nutrient-limited state, and generally support lower phytoplankton biomass and cell sizes (Bibby et al. 2008;Brown et al. 2008). Vertical transport of nutrients into the euphotic zone occurs via two primary mechanisms-shoaling of isopycnals and coastal upwelling (Owen 1980;Biller and Bruland 2014). Seasonal shifts in wind direction control the presence and absence of upwelling, impacting nutrient distributions at the surface. In the summer, winds blow equatorward, leading to Ekman transport offshore and coastal upwelling; contrastingly, in the winter, prevailing winds switch to a poleward direction, causing Ekman transport onshore and downwelling along the coast (Du and Peterson 2013). Coastal upwelling in response to equatorward winds in the summer delivers waters with N, Si, and phosphate concentrations that range from 15-35, 15-45, and 1.3-2.6 μmol L À1 , respectively, which stimulate Chlorophyll a (Chl a) values between 10 and 35 μg L À1 at the surface (Bruland et al. 2001). These wind-driven upwelling events in the California Current System are typically dominated, at least initially, by diatoms, which are especially suited to respond to nutrient delivery associated with high turbulence (Benoiston et al. 2017). In addition, some diatoms in upwelling environments also appear to ""frontload"" the expression of genes related to N uptake, which is likely also a factor that influences their ability to outcompete other phytoplankton (Lampe et al. 2018). Following nutrient drawdown post upwelling, phytoplankton community succession in the California Current System can progress to a non-diatom dominated community (Wilkerson et al. 2006;Krause et al. 2020).",False,False,False,
320,10.1002/lno.12224,4,True,"In addition to upwelling and downwelling, the California Current System is also subject to other vigorous mesoscale and submesoscale activity, with eddies and filaments playing a significant role in the movement of water and creating many sharp salinity and nutrient fronts (Nagai et al. 2015;Chenillat et al. 2016). Eddy formation occurs from baroclinic instability (Bibby et al. 2008;Kurian et al. 2011), which can result from many different factors, including coastline irregularities, upwelling filaments, seafloor topography, wind forcing, shearing from opposing currents, or a combination of these (Batteen et al. 2003). The complex bathymetry attributed to a triple junction results in elevated eddy kinetic energy and a high frequency of filament and eddy formation near Cape Mendocino (Nagai et al. 2015;Hoover and Tréhu 2017). California Current System eddies are highly nonlinear compared to eddies globally, meaning that their rotational speed is much faster than their speed of propagation, severely limiting exchange with surrounding waters (Kurian et al. 2011;Chenillat et al. 2018). California Current System eddies are highly efficient in trapping parcels of coastal water and transporting them offshore (Combes et al. 2013;Chenillat et al. 2016). These eddy-trapped water parcels often contain upwelled waters high in nutrient concentrations, and diatom communities with elevated diversity (Venrick 2009;Kurian et al. 2011). Upwelled nutrients are also advected offshore via filaments-responsible for most of the nutrient transport up to 100 km offshore-and surface and subsurface eddiesresponsible for transport up to 200-800 km offshore (Combes et al. 2013;Nagai et al. 2015). In fact, 50% of the total transport of N in the California Current System has been attributed to mesoscale eddies (Chenillat et al. 2016(Chenillat et al. , 2018)). Because of this, mesoscale cyclonic eddies have been shown to support elevated productivity that is close to coastal levels for extended periods up to 1 year and up to 800 km offshore, increased phytoplankton photosynthetic efficiency, and play a substantial role in controlling the C cycling and export (Bibby et al. 2008;Brown et al. 2008;Chenillat et al. 2016).",False,False,False,
321,10.1002/lno.12224,5,True,"An appreciation of the various physical influences on phytoplankton growth that eddies can impart, including how vertical movement changes light and nutrient availability and how those movements may change throughout an eddy's duration, has been known for some time (Flierl and McGillicuddy 2002 and references therein). More recent advances such as the ability to run eddy resolving models with multiple phytoplankton species (Clayton et al. 2013), have highlighted the need to gain a better understanding of how eddies influence phytoplankton diversity and community composition (McGillicuddy 2016 and references therein), yet there remains limited information regarding ecological succession of phytoplankton communities in eddies particularly in the California Current System. As regional differences in eddy dynamics have been well established (McGillicuddy 2016 and references therein), it is critical to perform regionally specific studies of how eddies influence phytoplankton communities. In the California Current System, the entrapment of coastal waters, combined with longer lifespans of cyclonic eddies, allows for coastal diatom communities within cyclones to undergo ecological succession as the eddies age and travel offshore (Owen 1980;Kurian et al. 2011). Coastal diatoms are known to have higher macro-and micronutrient requirements than oceanic species, making them more susceptible to nutrient limitation and more likely to draw nutrients down rapidly (Marchetti et al. 2006). Thus, ecological succession within an aging eddy may result in a community adapted to the niche created by nutrient drawdown. There is some evidence to support this in a previous spatial study in the California Current System, which found diatom communities of similar composition in concentric circles around the center of an eddy, with each circle in a different stage of succession (Owen 1980). A temporal study of a cyclonic eddy near Hawaii also found that after the nutrients in the surface mixed layer had been depleted, the larger-celled, coastal diatoms were succeeded by smaller-celled, open ocean diatoms (Brown et al. 2008).

Our study combines measurements of hydrographic parameters, macroand micronutrient concentrations, and an examination of diatom community composition using a high-throughput sequencing technique targeting diatoms (Chappell et al. 2019). The main hypotheses tested were: (1) diatom communities in the eddies are distinct from those of non-eddy surrounding waters; and (2) diatom community composition shifts associated with the two eddies of different ages correlate with changing physicochemical variables such as salinity and nutrient concentrations. We also include a discussion of our results in the context of ecological succession under the assumption that examining the diatom community composition of two eddies that originated from the same region 2 months apart can serve as a proxy for an in situ study of ecological succession of diatoms within a single California Current System eddy.",False,False,False,

## Environmental data
Sampling occurred 13-14 July 2014 on R/V Melville cruise MV1405 (Fig. 1). The cruise track began 430 km from the coastline of Northern California, traveled northeast, and pivoted midway to allow for sampling through the centers of two cyclonic eddies. This synoptic survey took 26 h, making it as close to a snapshot of the system as possible. Sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity were measured using an SBE 21 Thermosalinograph (SeaBird Electronics) and Chl a fluorescence was measured using a Turner 10 AU fluorometer from the flowthrough intake, the values of which were calibrated via chemical extraction of Chl a on board at the start of the cruise (data not shown). Wind speed was measured using a WindmasterPro Anemometer (Gill Instruments). Salinity, SST, Chl a, and wind speed data were smoothed into halfkilometer bins using the interp function of the NumPy toolkit (Harris et al. 2020) in Python (version 3.7.6). Potential density (σ θ ) was calculated using the Python implementation of the Gibbs SeaWater Oceanographic Toolbox of TEOS-10 (McDougall and Barker 2011).In order to identify the location of the mesoscale eddies, we used 1/4 Â 1/4 gridded daily sea level anomaly products that merge data from multiple satellites to obtain a highresolution view of the dynamics of the upper ocean (the Ssalto/Duacs altimeter products produced and distributed by the Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Service, CMEMS). In addition, we used the AVISO Mesoscale Eddy Trajectories Atlas (META 2.0) in order to track the trajectory of the eddies, and determine the time and location where they were initially formed.",False,False,False,

A trace metal clean surface tow-fish system (Bruland et al. 2005) was used to collect water from 3-5 m depth at roughly 1-h intervals (n = 20 samples total) while the ship was underway (traveling at $ 10 knots). One to two liters of water were filtered for DNA analysis onto 25-mm diameter, 3 μm polyester filters using a Masterflex peristaltic pump. Filters were placed in 2 mL screw-cap tubes with 400 μL of Qiagen RLT Plus Buffer (Qiagen), frozen in liquid N 2 , and stored at À80 C until extraction. Concurrent water samples for macronutrient, dissolved iron (Fe), and dissolved manganese (Mn) analyses were filtered through an acid-cleaned, seawater-flushed 0.2 μm Acropak filter capsule (Pall 500; Fisher Scientific). Nitrate + nitrite (N), phosphate, and Si were analyzed onboard using a Lachat QuickChem 8000 Flow Injection Analysis System following standard spectrophotometric methods (Parsons 1984). Surface dissolved Fe and dissolved Mn were pre-concentrated and analyzed as in Biller and Bruland (2012) with the adaptations in Parker et al. (2016). Briefly, seawater samples were acidified at sea to pH $ 1.7 using quartz-distilled HCl and stored in acid cleaned LDPE bottles for at least 2 months. Prior to analysis, acidified seawater was buffered to pH 6 and dissolved Fe and dissolved Mn were preconcentrated onto Nobias-chelate PA1 resin and then eluted off the column using quartz-distilled HNO 3 . The eluent was then analyzed using a Thermo-Element high resolution XR ICP-MS, which was run in counting mode. One third of samples were analyzed in duplicate to assess precision. Based on replicate values of the particular samples reported in this work, the precision for Mn was 0.16 AE 0.10 nmol kg À1 , and the precision for Fe was 0.07 AE 0.07 nmol kg À1 . Accuracy was also assessed by analyzing SAFe S and D2 reference samples. Over several ICPMS runs with this method, our lab obtained values for Mn of 0.81 AE 0.07 and 0.37 AE 0.04 nmol kg À1 , compared with consensus values of 0.79 AE 0.06 and 0.35 AE 0.05 nmol kg À1 . For Fe, our lab obtained 0.095 AE 0.014 and 0.94 AE 0.17 nmol kg À1 , compared with consensus values of 0.093 AE 0.008 and 0.93 AE 0.02 nmol kg À1 (SAFe May 2013 Consensus values). Calculations of Fe:N and Si:N were performed to identify the potential for nutrient limitation at the sampled stations with Fe:N of 0.2 and 0.07 nmol:μmol used to define the Fe vs. N limitation cutoff for coastal and open ocean diatoms, respectively, and Si:N of 1 used as the Si vs. N limitation cutoff (Levasseur and Therriault 1987;Biller and Bruland 2014).

DNA was extracted from filters using the Qiagen Allprep RNA/DNA co-extraction with an additional bead-beating step and homogenization using the QIAshredder column (Qiagen). The V4 region of the 18S rDNA was amplified and sequenced using the general procedure described in Chappell et al. (2019) with modifications described in Oliver et al. (2021). Briefly, the diatom 18S rDNA V4 region was amplified from each sample in triplicate using polymerase chain reaction and diatom specific primers (Chappell et al. 2019), triplicates were gel purified and pooled and then samples were multiplexed using a Nextera DNA Library Preparation Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina) using the Illumina v3 2 Â 300 cycle kit. Diatom 18S rDNA amplicon sequences were de-multiplexed and analyzed using the DADA2 pipeline (version 1.16.0; Callahan et al. 2016) with modifications described in Oliver et al.

Only ASVs with a diatom top hit were included in subsequent analyses. ASVs were classified to the species level if they had a > 99% identity to a diatom sequence, as species-like (akin to the cf. designation) if they had 98-99% identity, and classified to the genus level when identity was < 98%. As classifying down to ASVs may look at intraspecies variability rather than interspecies variability (Caron and Hu 2019), ASV clustering into operational taxonomic units (OTU 99 ) was performed using the CD-HIT algorithm (Li and Godzik 2006) if they had < 1% percent identity difference.

Analysis of alpha diversity indices, specifically the calculation of species richness (S) and Shannon entropy (H 0 ) was performed on both ASV and OTU 99 count data in R version 4.1.1 (Shannon 1948; R Core Team 2021) using packages designed to account for the compositional nature of high-throughput amplicon sequencing datasets (Gloor et al. 2017), specifically ""Breakaway"" and ""DivNet"" (Willis and Bunge 2015; Willis and Martin 2022), which provide standard error/variance estimates. These values were then used to calculate Pielou's evenness (J 0 ) (Pielou 1966) using the eq. J 0 = H 0 /ln(S). Shannon entropy (H 0 ) was converted to the exponential Shannon diversity index ( 1 D) using the equation 1 D = exp(H 0 ) (Jost 2006).

## Environmental data
Sampling locations are shown superimposed on gridded sea level anomaly for July 13, 2014 over a monthly composite of Chl a for July 2014 (Fig. 1). The highest values for satellite chl a were found along the coast (10 mg m À3 ) and lowest values were offshore (0.1 mg m À3 ). Based on a combination of closed contours of sea level anomaly centered around a negative sea level anomaly and in situ water mass characteristics (SST, salinity, and σ θ ), we defined the boundaries of the eddies. From this point on, Stas. 14-20 (nearshore) will be referred to as ""eddy I"" and Stas. 2-8 (offshore) will be referred to as ""eddy II."" The negative sea level anomaly was À1 m at the center of eddy II and À0.75 m at the center of eddy I. The positive sea level anomaly was 1.75 m in the center of the transect between the two eddies. The age, track, and diameter of the individual eddies was determined using the Aviso Mesoscale Eddy Trajectory Atlas (SSALTO/DUACS n.d.), which is based on remotely sensed sea surface height data. Eddy I was first identified on 18 June 2014 at 124.9 W 39.5 N, 22 d before it was sampled, and eddy II was first identified on 21 April 2014 at 125.5 W 39.2 N, 80 d before it was sampled. The eddies were formed within 50 km and 58 d of each other, with eddy II traveling offshore and eddy I remaining closer to the coast (the eddy tracks are shown in Fig. S1). At the time of sampling, eddy I had a diameter of 116 km and eddy II had a diameter of 212 km. Elevated salinity data from both eddies indicates that deeper waters had upwelled to the surface at some time in the past (Fig. 2). Environmental parameters are reported as averages AE standard deviation by region throughout the manuscript. The average SST in eddy I was 13.5 AE 0.6 C, whereas the average SST in eddy II and the non-eddy region were similar (16.3 AE 0.2 C and 16.3 AE 0.4 C, respectively; Fig. 2a). This lower SST in eddy I combined with the wind speed data (Fig. S3A) suggests that parts of eddy I may still have been experiencing upwelling at the time of sampling. Surface salinity was elevated in eddies I and II (32.96 AE 0.11 and 32.83 AE 0.08, respectively) compared to non-eddy regions (32.44 AE 0.07, Fig. 2b). Surface σ θ values ranged from 23.48 to 24.90 kg m À3 (Fig. 2c) with higher values in eddy I (24.59 AE 0.13 kg m À3 ) and lower values in both eddy II and the non-eddy region (23.90 AE 0.08 and 23.61 AE 0.07 kg m À3 , respectively). As SST, salinity, and σ θ differences were used to define eddy boundaries, statistics are not reported for those parameters. Chl a ranged from 0.21 to 3.06 μg L À1 (Fig. 2d) and was found to be significantly different across the three regions with post hoc tests revealing that elevated fluorescence in eddies I and II (1.15 AE 0.63 and 1.15 AE 0.63 μg L À1 , respectively) were significantly different from fluorescence at the non-eddy stations (0.37 AE 0.16 μg L À1 ) but not from one another (Table 1).",False,True,False,

Si:N ratios were generally below one in eddy I, slightly above one in eddy II, and well above one in non-eddy regions (Fig. 3d). Dissolved Fe concentrations (Fig. 4a) were significantly different between the three regions with post-hoc analysis revealing that the only truly significant differences in dissolved Fe concentrations were between eddy I, which had the highest dissolved Fe concentrations (0.41 AE 0.07 nmol kg À1 ), and eddy II (0.11 AE 0.08 nmol kg À1 ), which had the lowest dissolved Fe concentrations (Table 1).",False,True,False,

This drop in Exponential Shannon diversity and evenness was likely driven by the changing relative abundance of an OTU 99 from the genus Rhizosolenia (Fig. 5d; Table S2), which increased significantly in relative abundance in eddy II compared to eddy I and non-eddy regions (Table 1).",False,False,False,

PERMANOVA analysis found that eddy classification (eddy I, eddy II, non-eddy) explained 59% of the variability observed in the Bray-Curtis distance matrix (p < 0.01). Subsequent PERMANOVA analyses comparing Bray-Curtis distances between stations associated with each region (essentially a post hoc analysis) revealed that all differences were significant (all adjusted p < 0.01). Multivariate statistical analyses performed on the subset of stations where all environmental factors were measured were used to explore how variations in environmental factors correlated with diatom community shifts, in other words, how the physicochemical properties of the different regions could potentially be driving these community differences. While there were some differences in the R 2 values based on the different tests, which are generally interpreted as representing the percentage of the Bray-Curtis distance that can be explained by a factor or group of factors based on each test, the overall patterns in the multivariate analyses were the same (Table 2). The single environmental factor that explained the most variability in the diatom community regardless of the statistical test used was dissolved Fe and the ""pair"" of factors that combined could explain 68% of the variability was dissolved Fe and salinity. Other factor pairs that produced significant correlations were dissolved Fe and dissolved Mn, dissolved Fe and SST, and SST and salinity.

336,10.1002/lno.12224,20,True,"## California Current System eddy structuration
The formation and development of cyclonic mesoscale eddies in the California Current System have been studied and modeled in depth (Chenillat et al. 2016(Chenillat et al. , 2018)). The outermost ring of an eddy is the youngest and latest addition and is composed of water from a variety of regions including recently upwelled waters (Chenillat et al. 2018), which creates a strong front on the western boundary of the eddy, especially in newly developed California Current System eddies. In examining the physicochemical measurements from eddy I, it is likely that newly upwelled waters had recently wrapped around eddy I at the time of sampling, resulting in the dramatic shifts in temperature, salinity, and nutrient concentrations crossing from California Current water (Sta. 13) into eddy I (Sta. 14). Chlorophyll measurements at Stas. 14 and 15 (sampled at 18:00 h and 19:00 h PST, respectively) were surprisingly low for their macronutrient concentrations. There are three possible hypotheses to explain the low observed chlorophyll fluorescence at these stations: (1) Nonphotochemical quenching, a protective mechanism that photosynthetic organisms including diatoms use to protect photosystems from high light (Kiefer 1973), which has been shown to reduce fluorescence yields measured in ocean settings by 50% when PAR is > 1000 μmol quanta m À2 s À1 (Behrenfeld and Boss 2006); (2) Micronutrient limitation, such as low availability of dissolved Fe, which could explain why phytoplankton were not able to draw down macronutrients at these stations (Bruland et al. 2001); or (3) sampling occurred in a prebloom stage where nutrient drawdown had yet to occur (Engel et al. 2002). Because it was still daylight when these stations were sampled, it is possible that they were impacted by the non-photochemical quenching effect, however it seems unlikely that this is solely responsible for the low values as PAR values measured at Sta. 15 were low ($ 200) yet chlorophyll fluorescence was still reduced. Even with a 50% increase that might have occurred with PAR > 1000 (Behrenfeld and Boss 2006) as it was at Sta. 14, chlorophyll fluorescence values would still be low at these stations. The second hypothesis can likely also be dismissed as dissolved Fe and dissolved Mn concentrations were elevated at these two stations, thus it seems unlikely that micronutrient limitation was limiting phytoplankton growth and macronutrient uptake. Based on this reasoning, we suggest that the third hypothesis, that we sampled a prebloom stage, is the most likely because the lowest SSTs and highest macronutrient concentrations in these samples suggest upwelling was recent if not ongoing at the time of sampling. In addition, the diatom communities at the two stations were distinct from the rest of eddy I. The NMDS plot showing Bray-Curtis dissimilarity for eddy I reflects that diatom community structure varies both with distance from the center of the eddy and the hydrographic structure of the eddy. Stas. 14 and 15 diatom communities group together, which is likely because this station includes recently upwelled waters indicated by low SST and elevated salinity as discussed above. The community from Sta. 19 is also grouped with Stas. 14 and 15, which may also indicate greater exposure to upwelling as it is in the outer ring of eddy I, though SST was not as low and salinity was not as high as at Stas. 14 and 15. Sta. 20, while also on the outer ring, has a diatom community composition that is separated from the rest of the eddy I stations, which may reflect additional interactions with the nearshore environment including access to additional runoff to the coast. Finally, the diatom communities from Stas. 16-18 grouped together, likely defining the originally trapped parcel of water and center of eddy I, having undergone a 22 d succession since formation. Indeed, the SST is elevated at these three stations compared to the other eddy I stations, suggesting upwelling did not occur recently. Previous work has suggested it takes up to 3 d of relaxation post upwelling for diatom communities to fully develop in response to California Current System upwelling events (Wilkerson et al. 2006;Closset et al. 2021). The elevated chlorophyll, reduced nutrient concentrations, and grouping of diatom communities at Stas. 16-18 could reflect a similar dynamic whereby an upwelling influenced community had been able to grow in at these stations.",False,False,False,
337,10.1002/lno.12224,21,True,"Eddy II was 2 months older and had propagated further offshore than eddy I at the time of sampling leading to differences in both physicochemical and biological characteristics. Eddy II had higher SST than eddy I, which is not surprising considering that these surface waters had been exposed to extensive solar radiation since their last encounter with cold upwelled waters. The salinity measurements in eddy II resembled a tiered structure. Based on this structure, we defined Stas. 5 and 6 as the center of eddy II, with Stas. 4 and 7 as part of a circle around Stas. 5 and 6. The outer circle was composed of Stas. 2 and 3 on the western side of the eddy and Sta. 8 on the eastern side of the eddy. Overall, the diatom communities in the eddy II stations group together more tightly than those in eddy I. That said, diatom communities at some stations grouped closer together than others and these groupings did not always line up perfectly with the groupings of stations by salinity. We note that while salinity and σ θ could support grouping Sta. 9 as part of eddy II, remotely sensed SLA does not place this station in a closed contour around a negative SLA anomaly. In addition, there was a significant drop in SST and a slight increase in salinity between Stas. 8 and 9 that may be a signature of localized, small-scale upwelling, which could also explain the increase in Chl a and N in the same region. For these reasons, Sta. 9 is not considered to be part of eddy II. Indeed, Sta. 9 diatom community composition grouped most closely with the communities in eddy I. At the western boundary of eddy II, we saw dramatic changes in diatom community composition and decreases in both diatom diversity and evenness between Sta. 1, outside of eddy II, to Sta. 2, inside eddy II. The eddy II boundary between Stas. 1 and 2 was also associated with an increase in salinity and a significant increase in chlorophyll (noting that Sta. 1 was sampled at midnight). As for the non-eddy stations, there was less similarity of the diatom communities among the non-eddy stations compared to the community similarities seen within the eddies.",False,False,False,
338,10.1002/lno.12224,22,True,"## Nutrient ratios and multivariate analyses
Eddy I was high in both macro-and micro-nutrients, though nutrient ratios (Si:N < 1; Fe:N < 0.2 nmol:μmol) suggest the potential for these waters to progress towards Fe and/or Si limitation. The broad shelf area off Cape Mendocino has previously been described as an Fe-replete region (Bruland et al. 2001). However, the potential for Fe-limitation in a normally Fe-replete region was shown during the same cruise in a moderate shelf region off Cape Blanco, Oregon, just 300 km north (Till et al. 2019). It is also worth noting that while Si has not typically been thought to be a limiting nutrient for diatoms in the NE Pacific (Wilson and Qiu 2008), recent work, including analyses from this cruise, have found evidence of Si limitation in the California Current System (McNair et al. 2018;Closset et al. 2021). The Si:N ratios from eddy I suggest that eventual Si limitation was possible during macronutrient drawdown and that non-siliceous phytoplankton may also have been important contributors to the community, which our analyses would not capture. It has also been shown in some regions of the California Current System that diatoms experiencing Fe limitation can become more silicified by increasing their Si:N uptake ratios (Hutchins and Bruland 1998;Hutchins et al. 1998). This could lead to an eventual Fe and Si co-limitation scenario as eddy I waters age, though at the time of sampling macro-and micro-nutrient concentrations were still high in eddy I, so we do not think diatoms were currently growth limited by either Fe or Si.",False,False,False,
339,10.1002/lno.12224,23,True,"Nutrient concentrations in eddy II were much lower than eddy I, which is not surprising given the likelihood that eddy II trapped a coastal phytoplankton community when it formed, and experienced limited exchange with non-eddy waters as it transited offshore. Thus, reduced access to nutrient-rich coastal waters and sustained photosynthetic activity by a nutrient-demanding coastal phytoplankton community would have led to the depletion of nutrients. Looking at Si:N ratios, eddy II had the potential to be limited by N (Si: N > 1) at all stations except Sta. 8. This shift in nutrient ratios from Si:N < 1 to Si:N > 1 between the two eddies would suggest preferential drawdown of N over Si, which would require the presence of a phytoplankton community that included non-diatoms, as the lowest Si:N drawdown observed in Fe replete waters has been found to be 1 (Brzezinski et al. 2002) or an elevated ratio of Si:N in the initial parcel of water that was trapped by the eddy when it formed. Assuming the eddy II diatom communities were coastal and had a Fe:N limitation threshold of 0.2 nmol:μmol (Biller and Bruland 2014), the Fe: N ratios of suggest that the surface waters in eddy II had the potential to be limited by N at Sta. 2 and limited by Fe at the remaining stations. If the diatom community had progressed to one that includes open ocean diatoms that have a Fe:N limitation ratio of 0.07 nmol:μmol (Biller and Bruland 2014), diatom communities in the surface waters at Stas. 4 and 6 may have also been N-limited. The potential role of Fe in shaping diatom community structure in the region is further supported by multivariate correlation analyses that found dissolved Fe to be among the environmental factors that, either alone or when combined with salinity or SST, had statistically significant correlations with diatom community composition.",False,False,False,
340,10.1002/lno.12224,24,True,"We note that multivariate analyses also found dissolved Mn to correlate with changes in diatom community composition when combined with changes in dissolved Fe. Like Fe, Mn is a bioactive trace metal required in elevated quantities by phytoplankton for their photosynthetic machinery (Raven et al. 1999). Generally, surface drawdown of dissolved Mn is not as prevalent as has been observed for dissolved Fe (Morel et al. 2003) with an exception being the Southern Ocean, where dissolved Mn concentrations have been found to be exceedingly low (e.g., Martin et al. 1990;Middag et al. 2011Middag et al. , 2013)). Lab culture experiments have found evidence that both temperate and Southern Ocean diatoms can experience dissolved Mn limitation of primary production (Sunda andHuntsman 1983, 1996;Pausch et al. 2019). It is only recently, however, that Fe-Mn co-limitation has been observed in the field and this has only been observed in incubation experiments with Southern Ocean phytoplankton communities from the Drake Passage in spring (Browning et al. 2021). Considering that the dissolved Mn concentrations observed in our study are roughly an order of magnitude higher than those measured in the Southern Ocean where Mn-Fe co-limitation was observed, and Mn* values were all above 1.5, it is unlikely that Mn limitation would have been an important driver shaping phytoplankton communities here. Both dissolved Fe and dissolved Mn have similar coastal sources with dust (Duce and Tindale 1991;Guieu et al. 1994;Baker et al. 2016) and reducing sediments (Homoky et al. 2016) being especially important, thus the dissolved Mn may be acting as a tracer of past dissolved Fe (and other dissolved metal) inputs. In other words, the fact that dissolved Mn concentrations are similar in both eddies could be indicative of eddy II initially having had dissolved Fe concentrations of the same magnitude of those observed in eddy I when it originated near Cape Mendocino. Viewed in this light, the increase in the correlation coefficient when dissolved Mn is included as a factor could reflect that the biological community is influenced not only by being in an eddy (salinity, SST) and dissolved Fe limitation status (dissolved Fe), but by the initial dissolved metal inputs when the parcel was near coastal sources (dissolved Mn). However, with only correlations to support this hypothesis, it is merely speculative.",False,False,False,
341,10.1002/lno.12224,25,True,"## Rhizosolenia dominance of eddy II
We note that Rhizosolenia, a genus of diatoms with high Si requirements known to have strategies that help overcome N limitation (Villareal et al. 1996), was the most abundant diatom genus recovered from the eddy II stations. One OTU 99 (Rhizosolenia sp. 6) accounted for 40% or more of the diatom community at all seven eddy II stations, with three of these stations having communities dominated by more than 70% Rhizosolenia sp. 6. The two eddy II stations with marginally reduced Rhizosolenia sp. 6 relative abundance, 4 and 8, also had the lowest observed Si : N ratios in eddy II, indicating a potential shift towards Si limitation. Interestingly, Sta. 20 in eddy I exhibited the highest Si concentration across the entire transect, the highest Si:N ratio within eddy I (> 1), and the highest relative abundance of Rhizosolenia sp. 6 outside of eddy II. We acknowledge that 18S copy number per cell is known to vary in response to biovolume in diatoms (Godhe al. 2008) and Rhizosolenia spp. tend to have high biovolumes (Olenina et al. 2006). Thus, in terms of cell counts, Rhizosolenia may not have been numerically dominant in eddy II, but it nonetheless dominated the diatom biomass in these samples.",False,False,False,
342,10.1002/lno.12224,26,True,"Some species within the Rhizosolenia genus can form mats that migrate vertically to access deep N pools using a buoyancy mechanism regulated by cellular carbohydrate ballasting (Villareal et al. 1996). Isotopic and optical methods have shown that Rhizosolenia can access N from as deep as 305 m (Pilskaln et al. 2005). Vertical migration of Rhizosolenia mats is asynchronous, non-diurnal migration (Villareal et al. 1996). In contrast to upwelling events, which bring both C and N to the surface, when Rhizosolenia mats migrate vertically, they access new N below the euphotic zone and then return to the surface to carry out photosynthesis, removing C from surface waters more efficiently than nonvertically migrating phytoplankton (Wilson and Qiu 2008). Thus, a dominant, recurring presence of Rhizosolenia mats in California Current System eddies could impact regional C cycling and export estimates. Mat accumulation at the surface occurs for several days at a time (Richardson et al. 1998), especially during low-wind periods (Villareal et al. 1996). Eight species of Rhizosolenia have been identified in mats in the NE Pacific, including R. castracanei, R. debyana, R. acuminata, R. formosa, R. ostenfeldii, R. decipiens, R. fallax, and R. shrubsolei (Carpenter et al. 1977;Villareal and Carpenter 1989). Unfortunately, the majority of the Rhizosolenia species previously identified as mat formers are not yet represented in NCBI 18S sequences, including R. castracanei, R. debyana, R. acuminata, R. ostenfeldii, and R. decipiens. The absence of these 18S sequences could explain the low match percentages ($ 90%) of our Rhizosolenia 18S sequences to the R. shubsholei 18S sequence (Tables S1 and S2). One species of Rhizosolenia, R. clevei, which is also not in the sequence library, is known to host the cyanobacterium Richelia intracellularis as an endosymbiont in a diatomdiazotroph assemblage (DDA) (Villareal and Carpenter 1989) where R. intracellularis fixes dinitrogen (N 2 ) into a bioavailable form of nitrogen transferring as much as 97.3% of the total fixed nitrogen to its diatom host (Foster et al. 2011). While most of the Rhizosolenia sequences from our study cannot be unequivocally confirmed as either a vertically migrating species or the DDA species, several lines of evidence suggest that the sequences observed belong to matforming, vertically migrating Rhizosolenia species. The top BLASTN hits were that of a previously identified mat-former and vertical migrator, R. shrubsolei. The presence of two distinct OTU 99 of Rhizosolenia with elevated relative abundances in eddy II, suggests the possibility that they formed a multi-species mat, as has been found in previous studies (Villareal and Carpenter 1989). In addition, the low wind speed conditions (8-12 m s À1 ) in eddy II (Fig. S3) would be suitable, though near the upper limit, for Rhizosolenia mats to remain intact (Villareal and Carpenter 1989;Villareal et al. 1996). Finally, the process of N 2 fixation for diazotrophs is energetically expensive and dependent on sufficient Fe bioavailability (Falkowski et al. 1998). Because eddy II surface waters had very low dissolved Fe concentrations, N 2 fixation may have been Fe-limited at the time of sampling.",False,True,False,

Given the unique situation in that we were able to sample two eddies that formed in roughly the same region 2 months apart, one way to interpret our dataset is to view it as a study of diatom succession in California Current System eddies. Viewed as such, our data suggest that once an eddy evolves over time into a later-stage, offshore eddy, the phytoplankton communities are substantially distinct from the originally trapped coastal communities because of ecological succession driven by the aging eddy's shifting physicochemical properties. We have provided a schematic to illustrate this diatom community progression showing that high-nutrient, highdiversity coastal waters are initially dominated by coastal diatoms known to have high macro-and micro-nutrient requirements and that as surface nutrient concentrations within the eddy are drawn down over time, species equipped with low-nutrient adaptations can become dominant, altering diatom community diversity (Fig. 7). We do need to acknowledge potential limitations of interpreting our study using this framework. Eddy I formed 1 month prior to sampling around mid-June while eddy II formed 3 months prior to sampling around mid-April. Phytoplankton communities in the California Current System region have been shown to undergo consistent seasonal shifts in composition (Du and Peterson 2013;Peterson et al. 2017). That said, a study in the upwelling region near Bodega Bay found nearly identical coastal diatom communities, including elevated relative abundances of Chaetoceros and Rhizosolenia, in yearly intervals in the mid-May to late-June timeframe despite high turbulence and mixing (Lassiter et al. 2006). Given that eddy formation was separated by only 2 months, it seems unlikely that differences in the timing of eddy formation led to the marked differences in diatom community observed in eddies I and II. However, as there were no samples obtained at the time of either eddy formation, the degree of influence of seasonality in ecological succession in aging eddies will remain unknown. In addition, while diatoms are known to dominate in waters with Si:N > 1 (Sommer 1994(Sommer , 1998)), some of our sampling stations did have Si:N < 1, which could suggest the importance of other phytoplankton. Indeed, it is wellestablished that upwelling influenced phytoplankton communities in the California Current System do often progress to be dominated by nondiatom groups (Wilkerson et al. 2006;Krause et al. 2020). As we only examined diatom communities, we are unable to make any conclusions related to overall phytoplankton succession within eddies in the California Current System.",False,False,False,
344,10.1002/lno.12224,28,True,"To enable us to generate a high-resolution, synoptic view of the diatom community composition across two cyclonic eddies of differing age, our study sampled only from the surface. That said, we acknowledge that collecting depth-resolved data could have helped to clarify the vertical physicochemical structure of the water column throughout the transect. To provide a comprehensive view of biological activity and export in California Current System eddies, capable of resolving evidence of vertical migration of Rhizosolenia (a non-trivial task), future studies should incorporate long-term, Lagrangian sampling of cyclonic eddies that include measurements of C export associated with mats. In the case of this study, we are limited in our ability to assess export or the potential for Rhizosolenia migration as we did not make any measurements of biogenic silica or particulate organic C or nitrogen and did not do Lagrangian analyses. While we did not make any associated measurements that could quantify this in our study, diatom community diversity is known to influence C export (Treguer et al. 2018 and references therein).",False,False,False,
345,10.1002/lno.12224,29,True,"## Conclusions
This study provides valuable insights into the impact of mesoscale cyclonic eddy dynamics on diatom communities in the California Current System, where the high nonlinearity of the eddies severely limits their ability to mix with or incorporate surrounding waters. Our results suggest that both the physicochemical and diatom community structure within cyclonic eddies evolve during propagation offshore. The combined effect of transport by, and ecological succession within the eddies is likely a key factor in mediating C cycling and export across the wider California Current System region. Incorporation of ecological succession in studies of biophysical interactions of eddies can help to clarify C cycling and C export estimates as well as the estimate of total N transported by eddies across the California Current System. In addition, our results suggest that while there may initially be elevated biological activity within a cyclonic eddy, it will eventually plateau following the depletion of nutrients by coastal communities. Finally, the estimates for C cycling and export in the region may need to be revisited to account for verticallymigrating Rhizosolenia mats. can be found in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (Bioproject accession # PRJNA743307): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/  bioproject/PRJNA743307.

## Abstract
The Maumee River is the primary source for nutrients fueling seasonal Microcystis-dominated blooms in western Lake Erie's open waters though such blooms in the river are infrequent. The river also serves as source water for multiple public water systems and a large food services facility in northwest Ohio. On 20 September 2017, an unprecedented bloom was reported in the Maumee River estuary within the Toledo metropolitan area, which triggered a recreational water advisory. Here we (1) explore physical drivers likely contributing to the bloom's occurrence, and (2) describe the toxin concentration and bacterioplankton taxonomic composition. A historical analysis using 10-years of seasonal river discharge, water level, and local wind data identified two instances when high-retention conditions occurred over ≥ 10 d in the Maumee River estuary: in 2016 and during the 2017 bloom. Observation by remote sensing imagery supported the advection of cyanobacterial cells into the estuary from the lake during 2017 and the lack of an estuary bloom in 2016 due to a weak cyanobacterial bloom in the lake. A rapid-response survey during the 2017 bloom determined levels of the cyanotoxins, specifically microcystins, in excess of recreational contact limits at sites within the lower 20 km of the river while amplicon sequencing found these sites were dominated by Microcystis. These results highlight the need to broaden our understanding of physical drivers of cyanobacterial blooms within the interface between riverine and lacustrine systems, particularly as such blooms are expected to become more prominent in response to a changing climate.",False,False,False,

Cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (CHABs) have become a common seasonal occurrence in the western basin of Lake Erie and its embayments (Bullerjahn et al. 2016). Whereas the Maumee River and its watershed serve as an important source for the nutrients that fuel these blooms (Baker et al. 2014;Kane et al. 2014), CHABs in the river are sparsely documented (Bridgeman et al. 2012;Conroy et al. 2014;McKay et al. 2018). Further, when cyanobacterial blooms have been documented in the river, they have occurred in spring or early summer with late summer blooms being less common (Bridgeman et al. 2012;Conroy et al. 2014;McKay et al. 2018).The Maumee River drains into Lake Erie, forming a freshwater estuary that is influenced by riverine and lacustrine processes within the Toledo (OH) metropolitan area (Herdendorf 1970). On 20 September 2017, reports emerged of a CHAB developing within the Maumee River estuary, prompting the Toledo-Lucas County Health Department to issue a recreational public health advisory to avoid contact. The Maumee River serves as source water for multiple Ohio public water systems including the communities of Napoleon, Bowling Green, and Defiance as well as the Campbell Soup Company (Napoleon, OH). Incident-response cyanotoxin sampling began at Ohio public water systems in 2010, but routine water quality monitoring of the Maumee River was not conducted until HAB monitoring rules were enacted in 2016. Most university research efforts have been focused on the open waters of Lake Erie. As a result, fewer data are available from the Maumee River and estuary on cyanobacterial bloom composition, toxin concentrations or potential for organisms to produce toxins other than microcystins.",False,False,False,
357,10.1002/lno.11558,2,True,"A diverse range of cyanobacteria capable of forming blooms are found within the western Lake Erie watershed. While Microcystis spp. is the common bloom-forming genus found in the lake (Conroy et al. 2005;Davis et al. 2014;Bullerjahn et al. 2016), riverine blooms are more commonly caused by Planktothrix spp. (Kutovaya et al. 2012;Davis et al. 2014;McKay et al. 2018). The presence of different taxa may influence the type of toxins produced, which may include microcystins, anatoxins, cylindrospermopsins, saxitoxins (PSTs), or the non-proteinogenic amino acid β-methylamino alanine (BMAA) (Esterhuizen and Downey 2008;Pearson et al. 2010). Further, due to the high levels of genomic diversity across cyanobacteria strains, taxa may be either toxigenic or nontoxigenic (Humbert et al. 2013;Kurmayer et al. 2015;Meyer et al. 2017) thus decoupling bloom toxin concentration from cyanobacterial biomass (O'Neil et al. 2012;McKay et al. 2018).",False,False,False,

For example, in western lake Erie the advection of planktonic propagules that could initiate the bloom can originate from riverine or lacustrine sources, as well via wind-driven resuspension of cyanobacterial resting cells or cysts present in sediments (Bridgeman et al. 2012;Chaffin et al. 2014;Conroy et al. 2014;Kitchens et al. 2018). In addition to delivering nutrients, riverine discharge can influence light transmission, which can select for taxa based on their photosynthetic efficiency (Scheffer et al. 1997). Further, discharge rates coupled with seiche intensity can influence flushing and retention time within freshwater estuaries (Trebitz et al. 2002;Trebitz 2006), potentially allowing for enhanced growth in optimal environments by modifying water column stratification, light availability, and advection of cells (Mitrovic et al. 2011).Here we present results (1) identifying physically drivers that are potentially responsible for the September 2017 bloom in the Maumee River estuary, and (2) describing the toxin concentrations and taxonomic compositions within the bloom and surrounding waters. Ten-years of observations of physical parameters (river discharge, seiche intensity, and wind) and remote sensing imagery from 2016 and 2017 were analyzed to identify potential physical drivers of the bloom related to water exchange in the Maumee River estuary. In situ samples collected from a rapid response survey along a 160-km stretch of the Maumee River and adjacent sites in western Lake Erie during the bloom event were analyzed to determine chlorophyll-estimated biomass, toxin presence and concentration, and the bacterioplankton taxonomic composition.",False,False,False,

## Historical analysis of physical drivers of transport
A historical analysis of physical drivers of transport in the Maumee River estuary from 2008 to 2017 was conducted to identify conditions relevant to blooms and their frequency of occurrence over the past decade. Data pertaining to the physical transport of water within the estuary (riverine discharge, seiche intensity, and local wind direction) were downloaded from collecting agency websites. Discharge observations (30-min interval) of the Maumee River at Waterville, OH (USGS Station 04193500) were obtained from the USGS National Water Information System (https://  waterdata.usgs.gov). Wind and water level observations (six-min intervals) at the mouth of the Maumee River (NOAA Station THRO1) were obtained from the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (www.ndbc.noaa.gov). Seiche intensity was quantified by calculating the one-half daily sum of water level increments, which represents the height of the water column moved due to oscillation across all frequency modes (Trebitz 2006). Daily values were calculated as sums (seiche intensity), means (discharge), or proportions (wind) of hourly observations from a given day. The local wind direction metric was calculated as the daily proportion of hourly winds originating from the east (45 to 135 N) and does not account for wind speed. Winds from this directional range would have the greatest contribution to surface transport into the estuary given its west-east geographic orientation to the lake. Seasonal anomalies were calculated as the observed daily values subtracted by the mean of daily values (wind) or the back-transformed log means of daily values (discharge and seiche intensity) from June-September 2008-2017. Percentiles for each observed parameter were calculated from the 2008-2017 dataset using an empirical cumulative distribution function.

Ocean Land Color Imager (OLCI) from the Copernicus Sentinel-3 mission was used to assess the spatial structure of cyanobacterial blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie during two separate periods: 26 July-6 August 2016 and 11-26 September 2017. The OLCI data sets were processed to Rayleighcorrected reflectance (R) using NASA's SeaWiFS Data Analysis System (SeaDAS) standard l2gen software (""rho_s"" dimensionless product) within NOAA's Satellite Automated Processing System (SAPS). Images were mapped to UTM projection with 300 m pixels using nearest neighbor resampling. Each OLCI image was masked for land with the standard 250 m landmask distributed with SeaDAS and for clouds using the cloud albedo, excluding bright reflectance water that has strong spectral variation (high reflectance in the near-infrared and green and low in the red and blue) to avoid masking intense blooms that would otherwise be flagged as clouds. Clouds were flagged using threshold algorithms, corrected for turbid water. The cyanobacteria detection algorithm used second derivative spectral shapes (SS) on the reflectance spectra with an equation:
with λ = 681 nm, λ + = 709 nm, and λ -= 665 nm (Wynne et al. 2010;Stumpf et al. 2016), and additional specificity for cyanobacteria by detecting the presence of phycocyanin uses shape with λ = 665 nm, λ + = 681 nm, and λ -= 620 nm (Lunetta et al. 2015).",False,False,False,

Beginning on 25 September and continuing through 28 September, a total of 18 sites were sampled spanning the length of the Maumee River through Ohio from near the Indiana border (Fig. 1), though not all sample types were collected from every site (see below). The study area includes the shallower river sites (> 20 km upriver from Lake Erie, MR159-MR52), deeper sites in the Maumee River estuary (from river mouth to ~20 km upriver from Lake Erie, MR15-0, inset box), and sites located in western Lake Erie (WB1-WB8) in both nearshore and open water environments (> 3 m depths, as defined in Davis et al. 2019).Integrated surface water was collected from selected sites (see Results) on 25, 26, and 28 September 2017 and processed by either passing through filters in the field (nucleic acids) or whole water samples were returned on ice to the lab for processing. For sampling of nucleic acids, 20-240 mL of surface water was passed through 0.22 μm Sterivex filters immediately after collection in the field and stored on dry ice. Two Sterivex filters were collected from MR0, one from a nearshore surface scum (MR0_A) and the other collected further from shore and outside of the scum (MR0_B). Samples for algal pigment (chlorophyll a [Chl a]) quantification and detection of total microcystins (extracellular and intracellular) and other cyanotoxins including anatoxins, cylindrospermopsins, saxitoxins (PSTs), and BMAA were collected whole, stored on ice, and transported back to Bowling Green State University or the University of Toledo Lake Erie Center for processing.",False,False,False,

Cyanotoxins were identified and quantified from selected sites (see Results) on 25, 26, and 28 September 2017. Total microcystins (MC; expressed as microcystin-LR equivalents) were quantified from whole-water samples following the Ohio EPA Division of Environmental Services total (extracellular and intracellular) microcystins-ADDA protocol using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Microcystins/Nodularins [ADDA]; Abraxis) at UTLEC. Whole water samples (generally 250-500 mL) were also filtered (GF/F) for the detection of particulate anatoxins, saxitoxins (PSTs), cylindrospermopsins, and MC variants at State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry (SUNY-ESF). Filters were extracted in 50% methanol using probe ultrasound, clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g and the MCs determined using an untargeted reverse phase chromatography coupled with single quadrupole mass spectroscopy (LC-MS) screening method. Toxins were separated using an ACE C18 column (3.0 × 150 mm, MacMod Analytical, Chelmsford, PA) and a 30%-70% aqueous acetonitrile gradient containing 0.1% formic acid as the modifier (Boyer 2007). Individual toxins were identified on the basis of their retention time, their characteristic absorbance spectrum in the photodiode array detector, and their characteristic molecular ions. The LC-MS method described here used a Waters 2695 solvent delivery system coupled to a 2996 PDA detection and a ZQ4000 mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford MA). It specifically looks for the molecular ions (and/or their sodium adducts) of 22 common variants (RR, dRR, mRR, H4YR, hYR, YR, LR, mLR, zLR. dLR, meLR, AR, FR, WR, LA, dLA, mLA, LL, LY, LW, LF, WR) and argNOD (Spoof and Catherine 2017). In addition, the photodiode array spectrum was scanned for additional MCs that contained the diagnostic 232 nm/239 nm signature for MCs present in high concentration that may be missing from the above list. Method recoveries and the measurement of ion suppression were done on a subset of samples by the addition of three MCs that spanned the polarity range (RR, LR, and LF). Method recoveries and ionization efficiency were consistently greater than 90% and no correction was made for extraction efficiency or ion suppression. For many of these variants, validated reference standards do not exist, therefore the individual variants were quantified using a standard curve based on MC-LR (Abraxis Inc., Warminster, PA). This approach required the MS be tuned to give equal ionization efficiency across the polarity range of the different MCs (RR, LR, LA, and LF) and that RR be tuned to maximize the singly charged ion. Use of a singlevariant standard curve similar to that used in the ELISA assay introduces about the same level of error (AE 20%) when applied to the different variants. Detection limits were highly dependent on the sample volume provided (10-500 mL) and were individually calculated for each sample (median value: 0.03 μg L -1 ; range: 0.01-4 μg L -1 ); 85% of the samples had a method detection limit less than 0.3 μg L -1 total MCs, the US-EPA drinking water guideline for children, and 95% of the samples had a method detection limit less than 1.6 μg L -1 , the US-EPA drinking water guideline for adults (US-EPA 2015a).

Anatoxins and cylindrospermopsins were measured using a modification of EPA method 545 (US-EPA 2015b). BMAA was measured using a LC-MS/MS method that cleanly resolves BMAA from the isomeric compounds diamino butyrate (DAB) and amino ethyl glycine (AEG) modified from Lage et al. (2016).

Chl a was quantified for selected sites on 26 and 28 September 2017 (Table 1). Whole-water samples were filtered onto 0.2 μm PCTE membrane filters and stored at -20 C. Two methods were used for estimating Chl a concentration depending on the sampling location (Table 1). For the majority of samples, Chl a concentration was measured by fluorometry (TD-700, Turner Designs) following extraction in 90% (v/v) acetone at -20 C (Welschmeyer 1994). For the remaining samples, Chl a concentration was determined via fluorometery (Turner 10-AU) following extraction of filtered samples in dimethylformamide (Speziale et al. 1984). Golnick et al.

## Historical analysis of physical drivers of transport
Time series data for transport-related parameters (e.g., river discharge, water level, and wind direction) were analyzed from a range of observation platforms along the river and estuary to detect anomalous conditions during summer months (June through September) based on 10 years of observations from 2008 to 2017. These long-term seasonal mean values are as follows: river discharge (37.9 m 3 s -1 ; values ranged from 1.6 to 2668.6 m 3 s -1 ), seiche intensity (0.36 m; values ranged from 0.08 to 1.82 m), and the proportion of easterly winds (0.27; values ranged from 0 to 1). The episodic nature of these parameters (discharge, seiche intensity, and easterly winds) are readily apparent as anomalies during summer 2017 (Fig. 2). Above average daily discharge was primarily constrained to June and July, while daily rates of discharge after 1 August were below the seasonal mean. Seiche intensity alternated both above and below the long-term summer mean with a pronounced period of low intensity occurring from 10-27 September 2017. Seiche intensities from 8-10 Aug 2017 were the lowest during the 10-yr period. The proportion of easterly winds also exhibited temporal variability, typically oscillating over periods of days with two 8-day periods of more consistent easterly winds beginning on 8 September 2017.  A percentile-based approach was used to identify both conditions present during the bloom and their frequency during the summer over the past decade. A distinct period in which both discharge and seiche intensity were < 50th percentile while % daily easterly winds were > 50th percentile was identified preceding the bloom (Fig. 3); these concomitant conditions were identified in 190 out of 1205 total days (15.8%), ranging from 5-31 d per year. Occurring most commonly in August and September, (39.4% and 36.3%, respectively) and least in June (4.2%), these high-retention conditions were typically short events (defined as occurring ≥ 1 consecutive days), with 50% of the 84 total events lasting only 1 day, while two outlier events lasted 10 (26 July-5 August 2016) and 12 d (10-22 September 2017; Fig. 4).

Differences in the spatial structure of cyanobacterial blooms in the western basin of Lake Erie that coincided with the extended periods of high retention conditions in 2017 and 2016 were compared using satellite-based observations. During the 2017 event, an extensive CHAB was present in the region near the outset of the high-retention conditions on 11 September (Fig. 5A). During the subsequent days, the southern extension of the bloom appears to be advected to the west along the shore and cyanobacterial index (CI) values appeared to be increasing both within Maumee Bay and the Maumee River, most likely as surface scums.

Bacterioplankton community composition was determined via amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V3-V4 region)  using samples collected along the Maumee River and in Lake Erie on 26 September 2017 (n = 17). Amplicon reads were processed using the DADA2 pipeline (Callahan et al. 2016), which allows for the identification of unique amplicon sequencing variants (ASVs). A total of 789 ASVs were detected across the 17 study sites. The observed richness of bacterial ASVs varied across the study range and within regions, ranging from 140 to 378 at each site while minimal diversity values (H´) were found within the estuary (MR8 and MR0_A). Lower values of the Inverse Simpson's Diversity Index (1/D) indicate that fewer ASVs dominate the community (e.g., MR122, MR8, and MR7) while higher values reflect a more even taxonomic composition (e.g., MR15 and MR97; Fig. 7) at a given site.Bacterioplankton communities appeared to cluster geographically, though relationships were dependent on the dissimilarity/distance method used (Fig. 8). Based on presence/ absence of ASVs (Jaccard), sites clustered into upriver (MR159 and MR122), downriver (MR97, MR76, MR52, MR15), estuary (MR9, MR8, MR7, MR0), nearshore (WB1, WB8) and open water lake communities (WB3-8) at a distance of < 0.65 with upriver having greater dissimilarity from all other sites (Fig. 8A). These clusters suggest a gradient of change in community membership at river sites approaching the estuary as  well as between nearshore and offshore lake sites. When ASV relative abundances are taken into account (Bray-Curtis), similar clusters form at dissimilarities < 0.6 and estuarine communities (excluding MR15) showed a higher level of dissimilarity from all other sites (0.87) (Fig. 8B).

A total of 78 cyanobacterial ASVs were identified across the study sites with four genera accounting for > 2% of total 16S reads at a given site (Fig. 9B). At the genus level within Cyanobacteria, Microcystis (five ASVs) comprised the highest relative abundance despite exhibiting a non-uniform distribution; it was not detected at any sites upriver from the estuary.

## Physical drivers of bloom transport
Analyses of flow-related parameters suggest that the 2017 Maumee River estuary bloom was strongly correlated with conditions supporting high-retention within the estuary. During periods of low river discharge, seiches can exert a potentially strong lake-based influence on freshwater estuaries, as evidenced by observations of current reversals up to 15 km upstream from the mouth of the Maumee River (Limnotech 2013). On the opposite end of Lake Erie, particle tracking models in the lower reach of the Buffalo River have shown the potential for seiche-driven sediment transport ≥ 5 km upstream from the mouth of the river during low discharge, high-seiche conditions (Singer et al. 2008). However, the observed seiche intensity in September 2017 was likely far too low to transport cyanobacterial cells upriver beyond the estuary. Instead, low seiche intensity indicated decreased change in water volume, thereby increasing retention in the estuary due to a lack of exchange between the river and the lake. The predominantly eastward winds likely played a more important role via the advection of surface waters (containing the positively buoyant Microcystis colonies which can aggregate into surface scums) into the estuary during these low-flow conditions. A general relationship has been shown using ocean observational data in which surface transport velocity of the upper 1-2 m is ~10% of wind velocity (U 10 ) and driven predominantly by local winds (Clarke and Van Gorder 2018). The geographic orientation of the Maumee River estuary makes it especially susceptible to wind-driven transport via easterly winds. Further, median wind speeds were 1.9 m s -1 from 10 to 22 September 2017, low enough to limit wind-driven mixing and maintain surface scums of Microcystis colonies (Cao et al. 2006;Hunter et al. 2008;Qin et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
375,10.1002/lno.11558,20,True,"The historical analyses presented here suggest that highretention conditions are not rare within the Maumee River estuary, occurring on average ~19 d between June and September each year over the last 10 years. This is especially true during the latter months of summer, which correspond with peak cyanobacterial abundance in western Lake Erie (Stumpf et al. 2016;Davis et al. 2019). The atypical appearance of the 2017 Maumee River bloom was likely due to the long duration of these co-occurring conditions. The majority of riverine discharge in the Maumee River occurs early in the season in conjunction with spring and early summer rainfall, with low discharge typically occurring during August and September as rainfall tends to decrease during these months (Stow et al. 2015). While observations over the past 20 years suggests an increasing trend in high-discharge events in western Lake Erie drainages, low to moderate discharge events lack this trend with data from the Maumee River specifically displaying a negative trend (Choquette et al. 2019). However, while seasonal rainfall data for western Lake Erie typically show low accumulation leading to the aforementioned low riverine discharge during late summer/early fall, rainfall during summer 2017 was relatively low (mean cumulative daily precipitation from three airfields in the Toledo region from June 1 to Sept 30 was 9.8 cm) as compared to mean values ranging from 13.0 to 26.4 cm during the same seasonal period in the previous 3 yr (2014)(2015)(2016). Therefore, the more variable components (seiche and wind direction) likely play a more prominent role in the formation and duration of highretention conditions during this time period. Decadal shifts in summer wind direction have been previously shown in the Great Lakes region, likely driven by atmospheric variability and displacement of summer storm tracks (Waples and Klump 2002). Despite only two events lasting > 6 d over the previous 10-year period, it is possible that anthropogenic climate change could alter the frequency of these high-retention conditions in the coming years. Finally, the occurrence of high-retention conditions alone will not guarantee the formation of a bloom in the estuary. The 2017 high-retention event co-occurred with a dense cyanobacterial bloom, however a large cyanobacterial bloom was not present during the 2016 event. Climate change is expected to increase the duration, intensity, and toxin concentration of cyanobacterial blooms (O'Neil et al. 2012;Paerl and Paul 2012), leading to greater opportunities for these co-occurring conditions to occur as well as increasing the supply of propagules that could be delivered into a freshwater estuary, such as the Maumee River estuary.",False,False,False,

Whereas cylindrospermopsins and anatoxins have been infrequently measured (Boyer 2007;Carmichael and Boyer 2016;Almuhtaram et al. 2018) and saxitoxin-related genes were recently detected (Chaffin et al. 2019), to date there have been no detections of BMAA in Lake Erie. The detections of total MCs exceeding Ohio's no contact thresholds (20 μg L -1 ) were restricted to estuary sites and their magnitudes varied between analytical methods and across subsequent days. Levels of MCs observed within the estuary during the 2017 bloom (272 μg L -1 total MC) exceeded those observed in Lake Erie from 2012 to 2014 (maximums of 21 and 10.6 μg L -1 particulate MC, respectively; Gobler et al. 2016;Steffen et al. 2017) and during a bloom of Planktothrix agardhii that occurred upriver in the Maumee in 2016 (22.5 μg L -1 total MC; McKay et al. 2018). Relative proportions of the major MC variants (LR, RR, YR) were similar to those reported during the 2014 Lake Erie bloom event resulting in the Toledo Water Crisis (Steffen et al. 2017).",False,False,False,
377,10.1002/lno.11558,22,True,"Greater than 250 MC variants have been identified to date (Spoof and Catherine 2017) but commercial standards were only available for a limited number of variants ( 14) at the time of this study. Targeted methods such as LC-MS/MS (e.g., EPA method 544) require the specific MC be available for tuning purposes and only report those variants when standards are available (US-EPA 2015c). As a result, these targeted methods may underreport total MCs if alternative variants are present. Samples collected during 2016 and 2017 in the western basin of Lake Erie and analyzed using LC-MS/MS were positive for seven MC variants (MC-LR, MC-RR, MC-YR, MC-LA, MC-LF, MC-LW, and linear MC-LR) with an additional 20 variants tentatively identified using high resolution mass accuracies and ADDA (Palagama et al. 2020). In contrast, nontargeted methods such as the low resolution LC-MS techniques used here or high resolution LC-MS methods (Yilmaz et al. 2019) may better quantitate total MCs by detecting a wider range of toxin variants using more generic conditions. Both targeted and nontargeted analyses may suffer from the limitation that trace levels of minor variants may fall below the detection limit. Here we used an untargeted but low-resolution technique to show that three common MC variants (LR, RR, YR) were the most common contributors to the MC profiles. Alternate non-targeted methods such as MMPB (2-methyl-3-methoxy-4-phenylbutanoic acid) integrate these minor variants/ contributors to the toxin profile and may produce results more consistent with total MCs as measured by ELISA (Foss and Aubel 2015), however the MMPB method was not employed for this study.",False,False,False,

Identifying the cyanobacterial cells responsible for blooms and their source is important in understanding bloom dynamics. Previous studies in western Lake Erie have found evidence both for (Bridgeman et al. 2012;Conroy et al. 2014) and against (Kutovaya et al. 2012;Davis et al. 2014;Kitchens et al. 2018) fluvial seeding of cyanobacterial blooms, as well as re-suspension from sediments (Chaffin et al. 2014;Kitchens et al. 2018). Genetics-based approaches such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (Chaffin et al. 2014), phylogenetic analyses (Kutovaya et al. 2012;Davis et al. 2014), and oligotyping (Berry et al. 2017a) allow for the biological fingerprinting of cyanobacterial strains present in different regions and bloom events.",False,False,False,
379,10.1002/lno.11558,24,True,"Within the Maumee River estuary, the cyanobacterial communities were dominated by the MC-producing cyanobacterium Microcystis, which is commonly found within the open waters of western Lake Erie. 16S-based Microcystis ASVs found within the Maumee River estuary sites were also found in the Lake Erie sites but not in river sites, which is in agreement with the advection of surface water into the estuary from the lake. The two most abundant ASVs found in the bloom are consistent with 16S oligotypes commonly found in the western basin of Lake Erie (""CCG"" and ""CGT"" in Berry et al. 2017a). Two additional oligotypes (""CTT"" and ""TCG"") identified by Berry et al. (2017a) were also found in this study, though in much lower relative abundances and in greater prevalence in the Lake Erie sites. Reads assigned to two other potential toxinproducing genera, Pseudanabaena and Planktothrix (Christiansen et al. 2003;Rangel et al. 2014), were also found in higher relative abundances at sites within the estuary, though less abundant than Microcystis. However, none of these three genera were detected at appreciable levels of relative abundance upriver from the estuary (> 20 km upriver), despite previous observations of blooms of Microcystis and Planktothrix > 96 km upstream from the mouth of the Maumee River (Bridgeman et al. 2012;Kutovaya et al. 2012;Conroy et al. 2014;McKay et al. 2018). It is interesting to note the co-occurrence of the two dominant Pseudanabaena ASVs with one Microcystis ASV (type A) but not the other, as laboratory experiments have shown the direction of Pseudanabaena-Microcystis interactions to be highly strain specific (Agha et al. 2016). It is likely that the Cyanobium ASVs identified here are equivalent to the Synecoccocus OTUs detected by Berry et al. (2017b). In an opposite pattern to Berry et al. (2017b), this study found the relative abundance of Cyanobium ASVs to be inversely related to Microcystis as well as in greater relative abundance at nearshore vs. offshore lake sites. Though beyond the scope of this study, potential habitat differentiation between some Cyanobium ASVs suggests potential utility as biological tracers for riverine inputs, as has been suggested for freshwater flows into marine environments (Mason et al. 2016).",False,False,False,

These results highlight the need to broaden our understanding of physical drivers that influence cyanobacterial bloom development within freshwater estuaries, which represent the interface between riverine and lacustrine systems. This is particularly important in places where these estuaries fall within large metropolitan areas, such as Toledo, OH, and other large lakes and their tributaries (Larson et al. 2013). While nutrient inputs that fuel CHABs can be reduced by modifying human activity at local and regional scales, changes in physical forcing due to climate-related factors are beyond such control and may even undermine efforts to combat CHABs through nutrient management (Ho et al. 2019). Leveraging long-term physical datasets can assist in determining the likelihood of synergistic factors occurring that may enhance cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater estuaries, improving our ability to forecast events in these habitats. This would provide opportunities for compensatory mitigation at the local and regional scales, such as by physical removal of biomass or increased water column mixing and/or flushing (Stroom and Kardinaal 2016), as well as inform decisionmaking strategies for geomorphological modifications of estuarine habitats, which may select for distinct and potentially toxigenic phytoplankton assemblages (Feinpeng et al. 2013). Further, phytoplankton traits play an important role in how physical drivers may influence the presence of a bloom. While buoyancy control has been shown to infer a competitive advantage for some cyanobacterial taxa (e.g., Microcystis, Aphanizomenon) to form blooms during periods of low turbulence (Carey et al. 2011), it may also allow them to concentrate biomass within the surface mixed layer thereby increasing the potential for wind-driven transport. By improving our understanding of the physical drivers (e.g., discharge, wind) and biological characteristics (e.g., -omics and toxin surveys) within these estuarine environments, we can achieve a more holistic picture of the mechanisms driving cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms in western Lake Erie and other large lakes and their tributaries.### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1.

## Abstract
Biogenic silica (biogenic Si) is a bioactive component crucial for the biogeochemical cycling of Si in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Its formation and dissolution dynamics are intricately linked to carbon (C) cycling. However, knowledge about the source, composition, and factors controlling the distribution of biogenic Si in coastal wetland sedimentary environments is still limited. To address this lack of knowledge, we introduced a suite of geometric models for biogenic Si biovolume calculation and investigated biogenic Si assemblages, along with biogenic Si and biogenic Si-occluded C contents, in sediments from representative coastal wetlands along the west coast of Bohai Bay. Our analysis showed that sedimentary biogenic Si predominantly derived from phytoliths (78.1% AE 5.8%), diatoms (18.2% AE 4.8%), and sponge spicules (3.7% AE 2.9%). Notably, phytolith",False,False,False,

assemblages were primarily composed of forms derived from the Poaceae family. The biogenic Si-occluded C content (0.035-1.870 g kg À1 ) within these wetland sediments was consistent across both sites, accounting for 0.97-5.71% of the total organic C pool. Structural equation modeling indicated that total organic C, pH, and amorphous aluminum oxides either directly or indirectly influenced the biogenic Si content in coastal wetlands sediments. These results demonstrate the critical role that biogenic Si plays in the Si biogeochemical cycle and provide valuable information that advances our understanding of the biogeochemical interactions between Si and C in coastal wetland ecosystems.Coastal wetlands, influenced by both terrestrial and marine hydrology, represent globally unique ecosystems recognized for a range of critical functions and services (Murray et al. 2019). These ecosystems serve as vital biogeochemical interfaces where complex chemical processes modulate the transformation and movement of key biologically important elements, such as carbon (C), biogenic silica (biogenic Si), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P), thereby making them ""hotspots"" of biogeochemical activity (Carey and Fulweiler 2013;Ran et al. 2016;Xia et al. 2023). Indeed, Si has attracted significant attention over recent decades owing to its importance in supporting the functional integrity and sustainability of coastal wetland ecosystems (Müller et al. 2013;Tréguer et al. 2021).",True,False,True,"The context is studying **coastal wetlands**.

390,10.1002/lno.12717,2,True,"The weathering of silicate minerals, a process that consumes atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and releases Si in the form of dissolved Si (H 4 SiO 4 or Si [OH] 4 ), stands as the primary source of Si in the biosphere (Sommer et al. 2006). This dissolved Si can be accumulated by siliceous organisms, leading to the formation of biogenic Si (SiO 2 ÁnH 2 O). Diatoms, photosynthetic phytoplankton characterized by silica skeletons, are notable accumulators of biogenic Si whose productivity is affected by Si availability in aquatic ecosystems (Struyf et al. 2006). Furthermore, wetland plants, particularly efficient Si accumulators such as monocotyledonous Poaceae and Cyperaceae, absorb dissolved Si from soils and or water, resulting in the formation of biogenic Si (the so-called phytogenic Si including phytoliths) within plant tissues (Epstein 1999). It has been reported that the global storage of phytolith in plants, estimated at 60-200 Tmol yr À1 , is comparable to the amount of biogenic Si fixed by diatoms (255 Tmol yr À1 ) in the oceans (Conley 2002;Tréguer et al. 2021).",False,False,False,
391,10.1002/lno.12717,3,True,"The biogenic Si cycling in coastal wetland ecosystems is of great ecological and environmental importance. Cornelis and Delvaux (2016) described a biogenic Si feedback loop within soil-plant systems, encompassing dissolved Si uptake by plants, formation of biogenic Si, the return of biogenic Si to soils, and the dissolution of biogenic Si to replenish bioavailable Si pools. Given its predominantly amorphous nature, biogenic Si dissolves at rates 10 2 -10 4 times faster than crystalline silicates (Fraysse et al. 2006), thus serving as an important source of dissolved Si (Conley 2002;Ran et al. 2016). In addition, differences in biogenic Si composition, including the different forms of phytoliths and relative proportions of phytoliths and diatoms, may influence biogenic Si solubility (Bartoli and Wilding 1980). Coastal wetland ecosystems can act as an important source of biogenic Si to adjacent estuaries (Zhao et al. 2023), where biogenic Si could further dissolve providing bioavailable dissolved Si for diatom, and thus affecting phytoplankton community structure (Tréguer et al. 2021). Moreover, the buried and undissolved biogenic Si in soils or sediments represent a stable and substantial Si pool, contributing to the overall silicon cycling in these ecosystems. For example, the stable biogenic Si storage accounted for 19-55% of the vegetation biogenic Si input in different ecosystems (Alexandre et al. 2011;Zhao et al. 2024), while approximately 4% of diatomaceous biogenic Si was ultimately buried in marine ecosystem (Tréguer et al. 2021). Furthermore, the turnover of biogenic Si is a key part of the coupled Si-C biogeochemical cycling. It has been reported that about 0.2-5.8% of organic C produced by plant photosynthesis can be encapsulated within phytoliths (Song et al. 2022). These phytoliths, along with their occluded C, are returned to the soil or sediments as plants decay and annual litter decomposes. Due to the stability of phytolith-occluded C, it may contribute 15-37% of the global average annual rate of stable soil C pool accumulation over centennial to millennial timescales (Parr and Sullivan 2005). Furthermore, the contributions of diatoms to the biological C pump are increasingly recognized, with estimates suggesting that they fix about 1 billion tons of CO 2 annually (Roberts et al. 2007). Accordingly, biogenic Sioccluded C can accumulate and persist in soils and sediments over extended durations, because of the protective nature of the siliceous shells, thereby playing a critical role in the longterm C sink and contributing to the mitigation of global climate change.",False,False,False,
392,10.1002/lno.12717,4,True,"Coastal wetland sediments are important Si reservoirs, characteristically rich in biogenic Si, especially within the surface layers (Carey and Fulweiler 2013). The presence of biogenic Si in these surface sediments reflects the contributions from siliceous organisms, such as macrophytes and diatoms, toward the primary productivity within coastal wetlands (DeMaster 2002). The types of biogenic Si in the environment are complex, mainly derived from phytoliths, diatoms, and siliceous sponges, with phytoliths in particular exhibiting a tremendous range of morphologies (Clarke 2003). Therefore, the composition of biogenic Si in coastal wetland sediments depends mainly on primary production and exogenous inputs from the ecosystem. In addition, our previous studies have indicated that soil biogenic Si contents were controlled by the characteristics of the porewater chemistry and soil physiochemical properties (Zhao et al. 2024).However, the specific distribution, composition, and regulatory factors of biogenic Si within coastal wetland sediments, alongside its implications for C biogeochemical cycling, remains unexplored. Notably, the variability in biogenic Si particle proportions within coastal wetland sediments demands further investigation. In this context, we examined the biogenic Si assemblages, biogenic Si content, and biogenic Si-occluded C content within sediments from two typical coastal wetlands. The objectives of this study were to (i) characterize the morphological types and assemblages of biogenic Si in sediments; (ii) investigate the determinants influencing biogenic Si distribution within coastal wetland sediments; and (iii) highlight the significance of biogenic Si in the C biogeochemical cycles within coastal wetland ecosystems.

The Qilihai wetland, located to the northeast of Tianjin, is a lagoon type ecosystem that has evolved from a former bay over time. It is bisected by the Chaobaixin River, dividing the wetland into the Qilihai Reservoir to the east and the reed swamp to the west, with Phragmites australis as the prevalent vegetation. This region experiences a mean annual temperature of 12 C, mean annual precipitation and evaporation of 611 and 1200 mm, respectively. In contrast, the Beidagang wetland, is located southeast of Tianjin and was designated an internationally significant wetland in February 2020. It comprises areas including the Beidagang Reservoir, the lower reaches of the Duliujian River, and adjacent mudflats. The environmental conditions here include a mean annual temperature of 11.3 C, 550 mm of precipitation, and 1777 mm of evaporation. The dominant flora in the Beidagang wetland are P. australis and Suaeda salsa (Zhao et al. 2023). Both wetlands are characterized by a warm temperate semi-humid continental monsoon climate, receiving about 75% of their annual rainfall during the summer months (June-August).A total of 39 representative surface sediment samples (approximately 0-5 cm thick) were collected from the rivers and reservoirs within the Qilihai wetland (18 sites) and the Beidagang wetland (21 sites) using a grab sampler. Prior and subsequent to each sampling, the grab sampler was thoroughly rinsed with water on-site to remove any visible sludge.

The grain size distributions of sediment particles were determined by Mastersizer 3000 (Malvern Instruments), with the error of less than 1%. To measure total organic C (g kg À1 ) and total N (g kg À1 ), sediment samples were treated with 1 M HCl solution at room temperature for 24 h, followed by rinsing until neutral pH was achieved, drying, and grinding. Total organic C and total N were quantified using an elemental analyzer (Vario EL III, Elementar), with a precision of ≤ 0.01% (Xia et al. 2022). Contents of total P (g kg À1 ) were measured by molybdenum blue colorimetric method using an ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1800, Shimadzu), after being fused by Li-metaborate and dissolved in dilute nitric acid (Lu 2000). Amorphous iron oxides (Fe ox , g kg À1 ) and amorphous aluminum oxides (Al ox , g kg À1 ) were extracted by mixing 1.00 g sediment with 50 mL oxalic acid-ammonium oxalate solution (mol : mol = 4 : 5) under dark condition (Lacroix et al. 2022). The concentrations of Fe and Al in the extractants were measured calorimetrically using 1,10-phenanthroline monohydrate, chromeazurol methods, respectively, on a UV-1800 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu).

Biogenic Si particles were extracted from 5 g sediment samples using wet digestion and heavy liquid separation (Zuo et al. 2014;Song et al. 2022). Briefly, the steps entailed: (i) initial treatment involved mixing samples with H 2 O 2 (30%) at 50 C for about 3 d to oxidize organic matter until the reaction stopped; (ii) after removal of the supernatant, the residue was boiled in HCl (10%) for 30 min to eliminate carbonate and iron oxides; (iii) residual solid matter from the preceding step was resuspended in 5% Na-hexametaphosphate solution, followed by centrifugation at 600 rpm for 3-4 min, and the supernatant was decanted; (iv) after completely removing clay, the samples were separated via density gradient flotation using ZnBr 2 with a specific density of 2.36 g cm À3 , yielding purified biogenic Si samples. To ensure complete removal of extraneous organic material from the biogenic Si, the extracted samples were processed using the Walkley-Black method (Walkley and Black 1934;Li et al. 2013). The purified biogenic Si samples were then oven dried at 60 C for 24 h, cooled, and weighed to quantify biogenic Si contents (g kg À1 ).

For each replicate, more than 200 biogenic Si particles were recognized (Ran et al. 2016), which was considered a meaningful number in micropaleontology and ecology (Utermöhl 1958;Thorn 2004). When particles were very rich, approximately half of the counts were made along transects in the central area of the slide to avoid bias due to potential differences in the spatial spread of particles. Phytoliths were classified according to the classification of International Code for Phytolith Nomenclature 2.0 (International Committee for Phytolith Taxonomy 2019). To estimate biogenic Si biovolume, a group of 10 geometric models was proposed (refer to Table 1).While microscopy allows for measuring two dimensions (length and width), accurately determining the third dimension (thickness) of radially asymmetric units was challenging. In instances where biogenic Si particles are prevalent in microscopic samples, various views may be captured, allowing for a series of thickness measurements to approximate the third dimension for a specific biogenic Si particle type. To reduce potential biases, measurements of 25 or more individual particles were recommended (Hillebrand et al. 1999;Sun and Liu 2003). Based on the assumption that the density of each type of biogenic silica particle is the same, biovolume estimations were employed to assess the relative contributions of phytoliths, diatoms, and sponge spicules to the total biogenic Si content, determined through the extraction method (Ran et al. 2016).

Similarly, biogenic Si also linearly increased with Al ox with Beidagang wetland showing a larger slope than Qilihai wetland. The extent and significance of these correlations were further examined through statistical analyses. Within the Qilihai wetland, significant correlations were identified between biogenic Si and pH (p < 0.05), total organic C (p < 0.001), and Al ox (p < 0.05), whereas correlations with EC, Fe ox , and dissolved Si were statistically insignificant.

## Biogenic Si composition and source in sediments
Analysis of sediment samples from two coastal wetlands showed that phytolith significantly contribute to the biogenic Si content, with an average phytolith to biogenic Si ratio of 0.78. In contrast, diatoms have a smaller impact, contributing with a ratio of 0.18. Additionally, the presence of sponge spicules in the sediments, a finding not reported in our prior investigations (Zhao et al. 2023), contributed minimally with an average ratio of 0.04 to the total biogenic Si content. It is important to recognize that the diversity of biogenic Si in aquatic ecosystems extends beyond the identified categories to include not only dinoflagellates and Radiolaria but also bacterial and fungal biogenic Si commonly found in soil (Ehrlich et al. 2010).",False,False,False,
408,10.1002/lno.12717,20,True,"The production of biogenic Si (phytolith) by specific species remains stable across varied environments. This consistency allows us to use phytolith groups to trace their geographic origins (Ge et al. 2022). In our study of coastal wetlands, the main types of phytoliths found were form the Poaceae family (Table 3). Notably, shapes like bulliform, rectangular, lanceolate, saddle, and rondel phytoliths are linked to the P. australis species of the Poaceae family (Liu et al. 2016), reflecting the Poaceae-dominant flora within these wetlands. Among these, bulliform phytoliths were the most abundant, constituting approximately 22% and 20% of the total biogenic Si content in the Qilihai and Beidagang wetland sediments, respectively (Table 3). This dominance is attributable to the prevalence of the phytolith type known as bulliform in P. australis (Liu et al. 2016), which are the dominant plant species in the study areas. Moreover, rondel phytoliths were positively correlated with saddle phytoliths (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was a significant negative correlation with elongate granulate and triangular prismatic phytoliths (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Fig. S2). The rondel and saddle types likely originate from P. australis, while the elongate granulate and triangular prismatic forms are associated with broadleaved woody plants and general fern taxa (Ge et al. 2022;Liu et al. 2023). Interestingly, an analysis of sediment compositions revealed a significantly higher presence of elongated granulate phytolith in river sediments compared to reservoirs (Table 3). This pattern of distribution is likely due to fluvial transport mechanisms, where phytolith from broadleaved woody plants growing along upstream riverbanks are carried downstream. As they move, they are gradually deposited within the aquatic system. Conversely, the vegetation surrounding reservoirs exhibits greater homogeneity, resulting in fewer phytoliths from woody plants.",False,True,False,
409,10.1002/lno.12717,21,True,"Although diatom is one of the dominant algal types in the Qilihai and Beidagang wetlands (Pan et al. 2019), it only accounted for 17% and 19% of biogenic Si in sediments of the Qilihai wetland and the Beidagang wetland, respectively. In addition, we found that the proportion of diatom tended to be higher in reservoir sediments than in river sediments, especially in the Beidagang wetland (Table 3). This is mainly related to nutrient concentration in the water column and hydrodynamic conditions (Figueredo and Giani 2001). In rivers, algae in the lower sections are mainly due to the accumulation and transport of algae from the upper sections. If water discharge is low in the lower sections, planktonic algae can prevail and form aggregates (Hilton et al. 2006). These algae, such as diatom, will die and settle, accumulating in sediments. As a result, sediments in the lower reaches of the Duliujian River and Chaobaixin River typically contain high levels of diatomaceous biogenic Si.",False,True,False,
410,10.1002/lno.12717,22,True,"Recent studies have demonstrated that the dissolution of biogenic Si frequently represents a significant source of dissolved Si in aquatic environments (Derry et al. 2005;Williams et al. 2022). The dissolved Si contents in sediments were correlated positively ( p < 0.05) with the proportions of bulliform phytoliths, but negatively (p < 0.05) with the proportions of elongate smooth and elongate echinate (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that different forms of biogenic Si may have varying solubility. Phytoliths and diatoms had highly variable dissolution rates, influenced by pH, temperature, aluminum content, and specific surface areas (Fraysse et al. 2006). A previous study showed that fresh phytoliths dissolved three times faster than diatoms in freshwater environments (Loucaides et al. 2008). In addition, the solubility of phytolith may vary depending on its source. Controlled field and laboratory studies involving phytoliths from different plant species have shown that phytolith dissolution rates decrease in the order of Deciduous > Conifers > Poaceae (Bartoli and Wilding 1980). This trend is mainly related to the content of aluminum in phytoliths (Bartoli 1985).",False,False,False,
411,10.1002/lno.12717,23,True,"## Factors influencing the biogenic Si contents in sediments
The biogenic Si content in sediments of the studied coastal wetland (mean 11.6 g kg À1 ) was within the range reported in other studies (1.4-54.5 g kg À1 , Supplementary Table S4). In different ecosystems, the biogenic Si content in soils or sediments can vary widely. For example, the biogenic Si content of alpine wetland soils was higher than that in inland and coastal wetland soils (Supplementary Table S4), which probably due to the fact that prolonged flooding and low temperatures in alpine wetlands suppress microbial activity, favoring the accumulation of biogenic Si in the wetland system (Pu et al. 2021). The biogenic Si content in soil or sediment under wetland and grassland ecosystems was generally higher than that under forest (Hodson et al. 2005;Yang et al. 2018). This disparity could be elucidated by higher plant phytolith formation rates in wetland and grassland environments. Herbaceous plants, especially Poaceae and Cyperaceae, can accumulate more Si in their tissue than woody plants (Struyf et al. 2006). Therefore, vegetation cover type was an important controlling factor influencing the biogenic Si content in soil and sediment. Even in forest ecosystems, the soil biogenic Si content under bamboo forest could be 3-10 times higher than that under Broadleaf and conifer forests. One reason for this is that Bambusoideae plants have an exceptional ability to accumulate biogenic Si with content as high as 8.0-28% (Song et al. 2016). Cereal crops are known to be proficient silica accumulator plant (Parr and Sullivan 2011). Due to the high rates of biogenic Si production in wheat and rice (Song et al. 2014), the soils cultivated with these crops have high levels of biogenic Si content (Supplementary Table S4). Furthermore, degradation processes caused by natural or anthropogenic factors can also affect the accumulation of biogenic Si in soils (Song et al. 2022).",False,False,False,
412,10.1002/lno.12717,24,True,"Considering the similarities in vegetation types and climatic conditions between the Qilihai and Beidagang wetlands, variations in biogenic Si content are attributed to differences in hydrological processes and the intrinsic physicochemical properties of the sediments. Our analysis revealed a significant and positive correlation ( p < 0.001) between total organic C and biogenic Si content in the sediments of both wetlands (Fig. 4b). Structural equation modeling further highlighted total organic C as exerting the most substantial standardized total effect on biogenic Si content in both the Qilihai (0.80) and Beidagang (1.11) wetlands (Fig. 5). This relationship highlights the integral role of plant and diatom activity in up taking dissolved Si, forming biogenic Si, and enriching sedimentary organic matter upon decomposition (Xia et al. 2023). Wetland sediments, typically rich in organic matter (Zhao et al. 2024), may impede biogenic Si recycling in sediments by inhibiting SiO 2 hydrolysis (Nguyen et al. 2014). Elevated levels of total organic C observed in the Beidagang Reservoir sediments (Supplementary Table S1) emerge as a critical factor in enhancing biogenic Si preservation compared to other locations (Table 1). Our findings indicate a significant negative impact of pH on biogenic Si concentrations within these coastal wetland sediments (Fig. 3a), corroborating the findings of Fraysse et al. (2009), who noted the pH-sensitive dissolution behavior of biogenic Si. This pH-effect is related to the destabilization of Si O bonds at high pH levels, facilitating the release of Si from biogenic Si (Ehrlich et al. 2010;Nguyen et al. 2014). Furthermore, Al ox significantly influences biogenic Si content, promoting biogenic Si accumulation within the sediments of both coastal wetlands (Fig. 5). This phenomenon is explained by the chemisorption of Al 3+ ions onto deprotonated Si O À sites from Al ox , which hinders the hydrolytic cleavage of siloxane bonds (Bartoli 1985;Nguyen et al. 2014). Liu et al. (2019) further showed that aluminum's potential to integrate into the internal structure of biogenic Sii, adopting a fourfold coordination, markedly reduces biogenic Si dissolution.",False,True,True,
413,10.1002/lno.12717,25,True,"Structural equation modeling results revealed that the factors regulating sedimentary biogenic Si content were different in the Beidagang and the Qilihai wetlands. Besides total organic C, pH, and Al ox , the biogenic Si content was closely related to both EC value and Fe ox content in the Beidagang wetland, while the biogenic Si content tended to be related to total P content in the Qilihai wetland (Fig. 5). Our correlation analysis showed that biogenic Si was positively (p < 0.001) correlated with Fe ox for samples from the Beidagang wetland, whereas less clear evidence of its correlation (p > 0.05) with Fe ox was found for samples from the Qilihai wetland (Fig. 4d). Previous studies have indicated that Fe ions released from the dissolution of Fe ox can form a Fe (III) oxide coating on the surface of the biogenic Si, leading to surface passivation of biogenic Si, which in turn can reduce its dissolution (Mortlock and Frohlich 1987;Koebernick et al. 2022). In addition, we found that the positive effect of EC value on sediment biogenic Si content was second only to total organic C in the Beidagang wetland (Fig. 5b). Typically, cations in an aqueous solution can neutralize deprotonated Si O À sites, speeding up the polymerization between bonds and ultimately reducing the solubility of biogenic Si (Nguyen et al. 2014). Therefore, the surfaces of colloidal and particulate biogenic Si could be stabilized to resist dissolution under high EC conditions. The biologic Si content in Beidagang Reservoir sediments was significantly higher than that in other study areas (Table 1), which may be caused by the higher Fe ox content and EC value in its sediments (Supplementary Table S1).",False,True,True,
414,10.1002/lno.12717,26,True,"In the Qilihai wetland, total P had a significant (p < 0.001) negative effect on sediment biogenic Si content (Fig. 5c,d). We found a higher total P content of the sediment in the Qilihai wetland compared to the Beidagang wetland, especially in the Chaobaixin River (p < 0.01) (Supplementary Table S1). Phosphorus is an essential nutrient that potentially limits diatom growth. Elevated dissolved P or phosphate levels can promote diatom blooms and the consumption of dissolved Si in the water column (Klamt et al. 2019). Much of this dissolved Si is regenerated from biogenic Si dissolution in sediments (Baronas et al. 2018), resulting in the reduction of biogenic Si in river and lake sediments during a short time scale. However, when the pools of the P are exhausted by diatoms in the water, the sediment biogenic Si content will be raised due to the deposition of diatomaceous biogenic Si. The bloom and settlement of diatoms will change the nutrient ratio and structure of the water column, causing Si limitation in the river and reservoir (Wang 2020).",False,True,False,
415,10.1002/lno.12717,27,True,"## Implications for C biogeochemical cycling
The biogenic Si-occluded C contents observed in this study (0.035-1.870 g kg À1 ) were within the range of values reported in the literature (0.017-3.870 g kg À1 ; Supplementary Table S4). Carbon sequestered by biogenic Si (stable organic C with a long C turnover time) is determined in part by the ability to occlude C during biogenic Si formation (Song et al. 2016). The C content within biogenic Si of the sediments ranged from 1.0% to 10.8%, lying in the range of values reported in the literature (0.2-19.0%) and was higher than that of the C in fresh phytoliths (0.2-5.8%, Parr and Sullivan 2005), implying that phytoliths particles had undergone varying corrosion after entering sediment. By contrast, after the diatoms died and settled into the sediment, the active organic C in the ""micropore"" space on the shell and occluded in the diatom frustules would rapidly decompose (Struyf et al. 2006). After weathering and decomposition, the organic C occluded in diatom frustules may be less than 5% (Reka et al. 2021). In fact, biogenic Si would experience various degrees of dissolution and passivation after entering soil or sediment environments, resulting in a noticeable difference in chemical composition and activity compared to ""fresh"" biogenic Si (Wickramasinghe and Rowell 2006). In addition, direct, specific references to the exact percentage of organic C in siliceous sponge spicules are relatively rare, typically < 5% of the total mass (Maldonado, et al. 2005), with organic C being primarily found in their axial filaments (Shimizu et al. 1998). Therefore, considering the proportions of the three types (phytoliths, diatoms, and sponge spicules) of biogenic Si in sediments (Table 3), it can be concluded that phytolith-occluded C were the main contributors to biogenic Si-occluded C pool in coastal wetland sediments, followed by diatoms and sponge spicules. On the other hand, ""aged"" biogenic Si particles are difficult to dissolve due to the passivation process, which is conducive to the deposition and burial of occluded C in soils or sediments (Kamatani and Oku 2000). In total, biogenic Si-occluded C comprised 0.97-5.71% of total organic C within sediment. This specific C pool is significant, as biogenic Si-occluded C serves as a vital mechanism for biogeochemical C sequestration and offers insights into C stability that cannot be overlooked (Zuo et al. 2014;Song et al. 2022).",False,True,True,
416,10.1002/lno.12717,28,True,"Determining the sources of organic C is crucial for further understanding of C biogeochemical cycling processes in coastal wetlands (Zhou et al. 2023). If the biogenic elements in the sediment are all derived from diatom, then the C : Si : N : P ratio in the sediment should be close to the Redfield-Brzezinski ratio (C : Si : N : P = 106 : 15 : 16 : 1; from Redfield 1958;Brzezinski 1985). However, we found that the total organic C/biogenic Si ratios in sediment at many sites were higher than those reported for Redfield-Brzezinski ratio of diatoms, especially in the Beidagang Reservoir (Supplementary Fig. S3). In addition, phytolith in the sediments were mainly derived from the input of terrestrial higher plants, while diatoms were from the input of local phytoplankton. Thus, high total organic C/biogenic Si ratios in sediments may be partly due to inputs of higher plants from coastal wetlands. These results indicated that organic C in the study area contained both autochthonous and allochthonous sources. In fact, autochthonous materials include not only diatoms but also other phytoplankton such as green algae and dinoflagellates, while terrestrial or anthropogenic organic C, which belongs to the allochthonous source, also contributes significantly to sedimentary organic C. The input of terrestrial organic C can be attributed to the processes of soil erosion and river transport, carrying the terrestrial organic C into the sediments, especially during the rainy season (Drake et al. 2018). It should be noted that anthropogenic organic C such as aquaculture and agriculture activities are also an important component of allochthonous organic C. Although the area of aquaculture in Beidagang Reservoir has been greatly reduced (Gao et al. 2021), it may still be an important source of sediment organic C, as reflected by the high total organic C contents (Table 2) and N : P ratios in the sediments of the Beidagang Reservoir (Supplementary Fig. S3). Additional, higher levels of total organic C and total N contents in the Beidagang Reservoir are also associated with sediment texture and hydrologic conditions. On one hand, high salinity (higher EC value, Supplementary Table S1) and poor sediment structure (lower clay content, Supplementary Table S1) in the Beidagang Reservoir inhibited microbial utilization of organic matter, favoring the preservation of sedimentary organic C and total nitrogen. On the other hand, compared with the Qilihai wetland, the Beidagang wetland is closer to the Bohai Sea and is prone to seawater intrusion, resulting in a relatively high contribution of marine organic C to the Beidagang Reservoir (Zhang et al. 2024). The average percentage of diatomaceous biogenic Si (particularly Centricae) in the sediments of the Beidagang Reservoir was the highest among all sampled areas (Table 3), indicating that its overlying water had high primary production, which in turn promoted nutrient cycling and the accumulation of organic matter in the sediments (Lewitus et al. 1998). While, the total organic C/biogenic Si ratios in sediments at some sites were below the Redfield-Brzezinski ratio (106 : 15, Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that the decomposition rate of organic matter was much higher than the dissolution rate of biogenic Si under the same conditions.",False,True,True,
417,10.1002/lno.12717,29,True,"The biogenic Si pool is typically the major contributor of labile Si in soils or sediments (Zhao et al. 2023) and may play a key role in coupling with C biogeochemical cycles (Fig. 6). Macrophytes and siliceous organisms (diatoms, sponges, etc.) can form biogenic Si such as phytoliths, diatom frustules, and sponge spicules in their tissues or cells following uptake of dissolved Si. After plant apoptosis, some fresh biogenic Si particles with relatively weakly stability are dissolved in the water column or sediments during burial processes, re-released as dissolved Si in the form of Si(OH) 4 (Fraysse et al. 2009). While some biogenic Si is highly resistant to degradation after a passivation process, its occluded C can be stably sequestered in sediments over long periods of time (Parr and Sullivan 2005;Fig. 6.

In addition, dissolved Si released from biogenic Si dissolution can be taken up by macrophytes and siliceous organisms, consequently increasing their C biomass (Song et al. 2016). This process also influences the uptake and cycling of N and P, thereby regulating their ecological stoichiometry (Xia et al. 2023).",False,False,False,

In this study, biovolume calculations were applied to assess the relative contributions of phytoliths, diatoms, and sponge spicules to the total biogenic Si in the sediments from the Qilihai and Beidagang coastal wetlands. The sediment biogenic Si pool was dominated by phytoliths, comprising 67.7-90.8% of the total sedimentary biogenic Si. Phytoliths, predominantly of the bulliform form, accounted for nearly 21% of biogenic Si in both coastal wetland sediments. Diatomaceous biogenic Si accounted for nearly 18% of the total biogenic Si. The proportion of diatoms tended to be higher in reservoir sediments than in river sediments, especially in the Beidagang wetland.The biogenic Si contents were correlated positively with total organic C, EC, Fe ox , and Al ox but negatively correlated with increasing pH. Total organic C was the most important factor in regulating the biogenic Si content in both coastal wetlands. After biogenic Si was buried in sediments, 1-11% of the organic C was sequestered within biogenic Si to form biogenic Si-occluded C (blue C), which can be stabilized for long periods. Phytolith-occluded C were the main contributors to biogenic Si-occluded C pool in coastal wetland sediments. In conclusion, we suggest that the biogenic Si geometric models for biovolume calculations should be applied to more representative areas in the future based on our results, which will be important for exploring the contribution of different types of biogenic Si to the C/Si cycle in coastal wetland systems and the role of biogenic Si in the C and Si biogeochemical cycles.### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1.

## Abstract
Coral reef metabolism underpins ecosystem function and is defined by the processes of photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and calcium carbonate dissolution. However, the relationships between these physiological processes at the organismal level and their interactions with light remain unclear. We examined metabolic rates across a range of photosynthesising calcifiers in the Caribbean: the scleractinian corals Acropora cervicornis, Orbicella faveolata, Porites astreoides, and Siderastrea siderea, and crustose coralline algae (CCA) under varying natural light conditions. Net photosynthesis and calcification showed a parabolic response to light across all species, with differences among massive corals, branching corals, and CCA that reflect their relative functional roles on the reef. At night, all organisms were net respiring, and most were net calcifying, although some incubations demonstrated instances of net calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) dissolution. Peak metabolic rates at light-saturation (maximum photosynthesis and calcification) and average dark rates (respiration and dark calcification) were positively correlated across species. Interspecies relationships among photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification indicate that calcification rates are linked to energy production at the organismal level in calcifying reef organisms. The species-specific ratios of net calcification to photosynthesis varied with light over a diurnal cycle. The dynamic nature of calcification/photosynthesis ratios over a diurnal cycle questions the use of this metric as an indicator for reef function and health at the ecosystem scale unless temporal variability is accounted for, and a new metric is proposed. The complex light-driven dynamics of metabolic processes in coral reef organisms indicate that a more comprehensive understanding of reef metabolism is needed for predicting the future impacts of global change.",False,False,False,

Coral reefs are highly productive ecosystems that build some of the largest living structures on Earth. The services obtained from the coral reef ecosystem include coastal protection, habitat provision, fisheries, and tourism (Hoegh-Guldberg et al. 2019). These services ultimately rely on biogenic calcification; the process by which a diverse community of framework-building corals, crustose coralline algae (CCA), and other calcifying organisms contribute to the calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) reef structure. Global climate change threatens the survival of important frameworkbuilding coral species, primarily through increasing seawater temperature and ocean acidification, both of which have been shown to directly impede coral growth and negatively impact coral reef-dwelling organisms and ecosystems (Kleypas and Yates 2009;Comeau et al. 2013). Exposed CaCO 3 structures and sediments are vulnerable to dissolution exacerbated by ocean acidification (Cyronak et al. 2013;Eyre et al. 2014), and it is expected that reef structure could be lost at a pace faster than it is constructed in the near future (Eyre et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
427,10.1002/lno.12002,2,True,"A positive relationship between photosynthesis and calcification has been observed across cellular, organismal, and community scales in coral reefs (Gattuso et al. 1999;Allemand et al. 2011). At the ecosystem scale, the balance of photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and dissolution, collectively known as coral reef metabolism, controls the coral reef carbon cycle (Albright et al. 2015;Cyronak et al. 2018). Net ecosystem calcification is defined as the rate of CaCO 3 precipitation offset by dissolution, while net ecosystem production is defined as the difference between photosynthesis and respiration (Smith and Kinsey 1978). Reef metabolism is often measured through changes in the carbonate chemistry of sea water as it flows over a coral reef ecosystem, which requires detailed knowledge of the local hydrodynamics (Marsh and Smith 1978). The ratio of net calcification to net production has been proposed as a proxy for monitoring reef function, which can be calculated from carbonate chemistry data (Cyronak et al. 2018;Takeshita et al. 2018). This metric provides useful insight into reef biogeochemistry as a simple, effective tool for monitoring change in coral reef metabolism over space and time (Cyronak et al. 2018). However, the success of the calcification/production ratio metric depends on a strong mechanistic understanding of how photosynthesis and calcification are linked from the organism to the ecosystem.",False,False,False,
428,10.1002/lno.12002,3,True,"At the organismal level, connectivity between photosynthesis and calcification is reflected in the phenomena known as light-enhanced calcification, or the observation of increased calcification rates during the day compared to night (Goreau 1959;Gattuso et al. 1999). Research into the mechanisms behind light-enhanced calcification have not yet reached a consensus, and it is possible that more than one process is taking place for the different species and functional groups exhibiting light-enhanced calcification, for example, corals, calcifying algae, foraminifera (Cohen et al. 2016). One hypothesis is that higher rates of photosynthesis associated with optimal light conditions provide the coral with more energy for calcification (Chalker and Taylor 1975). Other studies show that metabolic CO 2 production through respiration is an important source of carbon for calcification (Furla et al. 2000). Another hypothesis is that photosynthesis influences carbonate chemistry equilibrium at the site of calcification through the uptake of CO 2 , which enhances CaCO 3 precipitation (McConnaughey and Whelan 1997;Allison et al. 2014). However, it is important to note that calcification and photosynthesis take place in different tissue layers (Jokiel 1978). Cohen et al. (2016) demonstrated that calcification can be decoupled from photosynthesis by providing corals with different wavelengths of light, indicating that both processes are independently linked to sunlight. To make accurate predictions about the impact of climate change on coral reefs, we must understand the mechanistic relationships between calcification and photosynthesis at the organismal scale before we can fully understand their interactions at community or ecosystem scales (Edmunds et al. 2016).",False,False,False,
429,10.1002/lno.12002,4,True,"Shifting benthic community compositions are expected to alter the metabolism and carbon cycle of coral reef ecosystems (Hughes et al. 2018). In the Caribbean, coral reefs historically built by the skeletal calcium carbonate of reef-building corals, primarily branching Acropora spp. and massive Orbicella spp., have experienced unprecedented losses of coral cover and proliferation of macroalgal cover in recent decades (Jackson et al. 2014;Toth et al. 2019). Contemporary coral populations have lower species diversity and are dominated by resilient, weedy corals, such as Porites astreoides (Green et al. 2008), which lack reef-building life-history traits (Darling et al. 2012). As a result of these phase shifts, rugosity and carbonate accretion rates in the Caribbean have decreased over the past decades (Perry and Alvarez-Filip 2018), impacting the maintenance of reef structure and habitat function (Muehllehner et al. 2016;Yates et al. 2017;Kuffner et al. 2019). Quantifying organismal metabolic rates and understanding the dynamic interactions between metabolic processes is critical for predicting the impact of changing coral reef ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide.In this study, we measured the metabolic rates of key Caribbean coral reef calcifiers to determine the interaction among photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification over natural diurnal light cycles. We provide a comparison between species with distinct ecological functions, chosen to reflect past and present species dominance: (1) branching, rapid-growth Acropora cervicornis; (2) framework-building Orbicella faveolata;
(3) resilient, weedy Porites astreoides; (4) framework-building, stress-tolerant Siderastrea siderea; and (5) abundant, low-profile, crustose coralline algae (CCA).

All corals originated from Mote's restoration nurseries, where they had been either sexually produced and/or micro-fragmented from field-collected colonies between 2010 and 2017 (Supporting Information Table S2). In addition, crustose coralline algae growing on the base of two of the Mote restoration raceways were chiseled off and glued to clean ceramic tiles 3 weeks prior to the study.

While water flow has been shown to modulate coral metabolism and their response to environmental change (Comeau et al. 2014(Comeau et al. , 2019)), the goal of this study was to maintain a constant flow to compare the metabolism between calcifying functional groups. Sea water parameters of pH (Seven2Go Pro S8, Mettler Toledo), temperature, and salinity (YSI Professional Plus) were monitored twice per day. For pH, electrodes were calibrated against National Bureau of Standards scale buffers of 4.01, 7.00, and 10.00 at 25 C and validated using other carbonate chemistry parameters (e.g., total alkalinity [TA] and dissolved inorganic carbon [DIC]). Water temperature was controlled by an automated dual exchange heater and chiller, and, to maintain pH and salinity within each tank, water inflow was adjusted and changed as necessary.

One fragment per species was randomly selected each day and placed into an incubation chamber for $ 1 h at the following times: 2 h after sunrise (AM), during the solar peak (PEAK), and 2 h after sunset (DARK). On 3 of the 12 d, an additional incubation between the solar peak and the sunset was included (PM). Separate readings of PAR were taken for each chamber position at the start and end of incubations with Li-cor model LI-1500G and an underwater quantum sensor (LI-192SA), oriented horizontally. Average PAR light values (mean of start and end) were calculated for individual chambers and varied from 67 to 595 μmol m À2 s À2 between the three daylight incubation periods (8:00-10:00, 12:00-14:00, and 15:00-17:00; Fig. 2).Incubation chambers were set up in a dry raceway tank adjacent to holding tanks for consistent light conditions. Incubations consisted of four double-walled transparent acrylic incubation chambers (300 mL) sealed with a transparent acrylic lid, with a rubber O-ring closure (Fig. 1g). A thermocycler (VWR MX7LR-20) recirculated water through the transparent cooling jackets of the incubators at 26.5 C AE 0.5 C to maintain water inside the chambers at 27.6 C AE 1.5 C.

Dissolved oxygen (DO) fiber-optic oxygen sensors (Firesting O 2, Pyroscience) were inserted in each chamber to $ 1 cm above the coral 3-5 min prior to the incubation start time, to allow for acclimation of the sensor and adjustment of its position. The oxygen sensors were calibrated to 0% and 100% O 2 saturation using air-saturated water prior to each incubation. Real-time measurements of DO (μmol l À1 ) were recorded each second during the incubation. To calculate oxygen fluxes, start and end values were calculated as the mean values over the first and last minute of the 1-h incubations. The fluxes derived from the start and end values were similar to fluxes derived from linear slopes between time and DO during each incubation (Supporting Information Figs. S1-S6). Start and end fluxes were used for a more direct comparison to fluxes derived from the carbonate chemistry data.Water samples for carbonate chemistry analysis were taken at the start and end of incubations using a 100-mL plastic syringe; immediately filtered (0.45 μm), poisoned with 200 μL of saturated mercuric chloride, and stored in 250-mL amber borosilicate glass bottles at the Mote Ocean Acidification Laboratory until they were processed.

The Tidyverse (Wickham 2019) was used for data organization and synthesis, and data visualization was conducted with base-R functions and ggplot/ggpubr (Wickham 2016). Shapiro-Wilkes tests were combined with visual assessments of density and Q-Q plots to evaluate approximately normal distributions for individual species. Repeated measures two-way ANOVA tests were used to test differences between treatments and pairwise comparisons. Post hoc Bonferroni-corrected t tests were used to compare differences between all possible pairs of species at each time of day and for each parameter. Models were fitted using R linear and nonlinear least squares functions of the Stats package. Model fit was assessed by residuals plots generated using the nlstools package (Baty et al. 2015).

The initial slope (α) of the photosynthesis-irradiance curves was highest for the massive corals. Photosynthetic-irradiance saturation (E K ) was highest in A. cervicornis (P DIC E K = 356), and in calcification-irradiance models light saturation (E K ) was highest for P. astreoides (G net E K = 448 μmol s À1 m À2 ) and S. siderea (G net E K = 544 μmol s À1 m À2 ).",False,True,False,

This study aimed to determine the relationships among production, calcification, and light in a variety of calcifying coral reef organisms from the Caribbean. Differences were found in metabolism among morning, afternoon, and night incubations and were species specific; however, linearity between metabolic-irradiance model coefficients demonstrated that photosynthesis and calcification are correlated across species (Fig. 7). The results from this study confirm that photosynthesis and calcification rates of tropical benthic calcifiers exhibit a hyperbolic response to diurnal light cycles (Chalker and Taylor 1978;Cohen et al. 2016). Our analyses revisit the current understanding of relationships between organismal-level metabolism and irradiance in benthic coral reef calcifiers, and we interpret these findings in the context of ecosystem scale estimates of metabolism and predicted changes due to ongoing anthropogenic change.",False,False,False,

From the results of the incubations, three general groupings were apparent: (1) massive coral species O. faveolata, P. astreoides, and S. siderea; (2) A. cervicornis; and (3) crustose coralline algae. The highest metabolic rates were observed in massive coral species under all conditions (Figs. 3, 4). The metabolic rates of A. cervicornis and CCA were relatively similar, but they were grouped separately due to distinctions between the mechanisms by which coralline algae and corals calcify, and to reflect differences in the ecosystem function they provide. We discuss differences and similarities between the three groups in relation to their ecological function below. net Fig. 6.

444,10.1002/lno.12002,19,True,"Metabolic rates were highest in the massive corals demonstrating that per area of live tissue, they produce more oxygen and calcium carbonate. Despite their higher metabolic rates, it is unlikely that massive corals have a stronger influence on community metabolism than branching A. cervicornis and encrusting CCA because of the relative benthic cover and architectural complexity of each species found in nature. Given the distinct ecological function and life-history traits within the massive coral grouping (Darling et al. 2012), the similarity in their metabolic rates was unexpected (Fig. 4). P. astreoides is considered a weedy species of the Caribbean due to its fast growth, low-relief morphology, and ability to thrive in suboptimal conditions, whereas O. faveolata and S. siderea are key, framework-building corals (Darling et al. 2012). As Caribbean benthic communities undergo phase shifts, P. astreoides is colonizing space once dominated by massive, framework building corals to become one of the most abundant scleractinian corals on Caribbean coral reefs (Green et al. 2008). Our results show that the contribution of P. astreoides to community reef metabolism is at the same scale as that of traditional reef-building corals; however, the similarity in biogeochemical signal does not confer the same ecological traits, as P. astreoides does not provide habitat or architectural complexity to the reef (Green et al. 2008). Therefore, while shifts toward weedy species dominance may not be detectable via changes in reef metabolism, the changes in benthic composition will still impact reef carbon cycles and accretion through changes in calcium carbonate morphology and composition (Perry and Alvarez-Filip 2018). The third massive coral, S. siderea, is generally considered a slow-growing species. However, its calcification rates were also high, and the observed slow growth despite high calcification rates could be related to the high density of S. siderea skeletons (Hughes 1987). Fast-growing A. cervicornis had the lowest calcification rates of the corals in this study, but they can also have relatively lower skeletal densities than the massive corals (Kuffner et al. 2017). Historically, A. cervicornis was a primary reef-building coral species and occupied more space on shallow water tropical reefs in the Caribbean than any other scleractinian coral (Rodríguez-Martínez et al. 2014;Toth et al. 2019); however, it and Acropora palmata have declined by over 80% over recent decades in the Caribbean (Jackson et al. 2014;Rodríguez-Martínez et al. 2014). It is possible that the lower rates of calcification observed in A. cervicornis were influenced by the relatively low flow induced within the mesocosm setting, as higher wave action may stimulate growth in this species (Jokiel 1978); however, our calcification rates agree with previous estimates (Chalker and Taylor 1975;Chalker and Taylor 1978). Colonies of A. cervicornis have a complex, branching structure with high surface area and they contribute different ecosystem functions compared to massive corals (Alvarez-Filip et al. 2011;Darling et al. 2012), which is reflected in the lower metabolic rates observed in our study. In general, A. cervicornis has low calcification yet high accretion rates, although skeletal density shows plasticity based on growing conditions (Kuffner et al. 2017). The life-history trait of lower density skeletons could promote asexual reproduction when high energy wave action fragments branches of larger colonies, allowing for the rapid proliferation of Acropora spp. (Tunnicliffe 1981;Lirman 2000). Despite having calcification rates than the massive corals, A. cervicornis provides a unique habitat for the biodiversity of species which reside in the dense thickets formed by this branching coral (Tunnicliffe 1981;Precht et al. 2002). The lowest metabolic rates were recorded for crustose coralline algae; biogenic calcifiers which reinforce and strengthen the calcium carbonate matrix to cover otherwise exposed coral skeleton (Littler and Littler 2013). In addition, they promote calcification by scleractinian corals (Chisholm 2000) via inducing larval settlement and providing substrate for juvenile corals to grow (Heyward and Negri 1999). Due to their encrusting morphology, crustose coralline algae are often overlooked in quantification of coral reef calcification and accretion based on visual surveys. We report rates of calcification and photosynthesis in CCA in line with framework building A. cervicornis (Figs. 3, 4). This demonstrates the important contribution that crustose coralline algae can play in coral reef ecosystem metabolism beyond their other ecological functions. The two crustose coralline algal types were the closest to displaying net dissolution, indicating calcification slows or stops at night within this functional group, potentially due to dependence on light. Crustose coralline algae are expected to be more heavily impacted by ocean acidification than corals due to the higher proportion of high magnesium calcite in their skeletons, which could disproportionately impact the role of these organisms as important benthic calcifiers (Diaz-Pulido et al. 2012).",False,False,False,
445,10.1002/lno.12002,20,True,"## Impact of light on species-specific metabolism
Coral reefs encompass diverse and dynamic light environments over hourly, daily, and seasonal scales (Edmunds et al. 2018). However, most reef-wide estimates of community metabolism are conducted on timescales that do not incorporate instantaneous changes in light, even though community metabolism can change on sub-hourly timescales (Takeshita et al. 2016). Applying metabolic-light models to highresolution time series of light could provide more complete estimates of community level metabolism. Studies have shown that scaling up to community and ecosystem levels from organismal studies can be complicated in coral reef ecosystems (Edmunds et al. 2016); however, the comparisons in our study add important insight into coral reef metabolism research. In this study, net metabolic rates (both photosynthesis and calcification) fit a commonly used hyperbolic function with light (Figs. 5, 6) (Jassby and Platt 1976), supporting the idea that both photosynthesis and calcification are driven by light (Falkowski et al. 1984;Cohen et al. 2016).Photosynthesis-irradiance models fitted with both oxygen and carbon data sets (e.g., P DO and P DIC ) demonstrated that photosynthetic efficiency (α), modeled maxima (P max ), and average respiration were greatest in the massive corals, highlighting that these species are drivers of coral reef production (Fig. 5; Supporting Information Fig. S8). Light saturation (E K ) was higher in A. cervicornis and CCA, potentially reflecting their ability to thrive in the shallowest and most sunlit areas of the reef (i.e., lagoon and crest). For calcification-irradiance models, the massive species group had the highest maximum and dark rates (G max and G dark ), while estimates of calcification efficiency (α) were mixed across species. The differences between metabolic-light models support previous work showing that photosynthesis and calcification have species-specific and independent relationships with light (Gattuso et al. 2000;Sawall et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
446,10.1002/lno.12002,21,True,"Relationships among photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification have been shown to exist across a wide range of marine calcifiers, and in the current study, we demonstrate that a strong relationship exists across different species, genera, and functional groups (Fig. 7). The strong positive linear relationship between G max and P max indicates that maximum net daytime photosynthesis and calcification rates are linked (Fig. 7b). We also found a strong negative linear relationship between average respiration and dark calcification across all species at night, indicating that dark calcification is linked to energy produced from respiration (Fig. 7a). Linear relationships also existed during the day and night for measured values of calcification and photosynthesis across all species (light R 2 = 0.46, p < 0.0005, dark R 2 = 0.15, p = 0.005; Fig. 7c). However, relationships between calcification and photosynthesis were less clear within each individual species (Fig. 8). This could be due to lower replicates within each species and smaller ranges in dark rates that made it difficult to detect a clear relationship by species. While our study shows that photosynthesis and calcification are linked across benthic calcifiers, we also saw differences at the species level (Fig. 8), likely related to ecological function (Gonz alez-Barrios and Alvarez-Filip 2018). For example, P. astreoides has a strong linear relationship between calcification and photosynthesis (light R 2 = 0.39, dark R 2 = 0.78, p ≤ 0.005, Fig. 8), whereas other species such as A. cervicornis did not. Calcification of different species of corals has been shown to respond to global change differently (Kornder et al. 2018), which may reflect the interaction of these two processes at the cellular or organismal level. Light has also been shown to modulate the response of calcification to ocean acidification (Suggett et al. 2013). Therefore, developing species level metabolic irradiance curves under current and predicted ocean chemistry is important for understanding future impacts of global change.",False,False,False,

We demonstrate a positive linear relationship between modeled metabolic maxima (G max and P max ), indicating that energy from photosynthesis and respiration drive calcification. It is clear that coral metabolic processes are tightly coupled (Gattuso et al. 1999). However, recent research indicates that photosynthesis and calcification are parallel but independent light-driven processes (Cohen et al. 2016). The link between photosynthesis and calcification (i.e., light-enhanced calcification) at the organismal scale may be related to these processes co-evolving to occur at similar times due to increased energy supply for calcification (Sorek et al. 2014). If that is the case, then the relationships between photosynthesis and calcification found at the organismal level may not be as intimately linked within cells as previously thought. Further research is needed to define the functional relationships among light, photosynthesis, and calcification from the cell to the organism to better predict the impacts of global change on coral ecosystems.",False,False,False,
448,10.1002/lno.12002,23,True,"Knowing instantaneous relationships between light and metabolism at the organismal scale (Figs. 5, 6; Supporting Information Fig. S8) could help scale metabolism rates up to the community and ecosystem at finer temporal scales. Direct measurements of coral reef net ecosystem metabolic rates are time consuming, expensive, and often require specific environmental conditions (Gattuso et al. 1999). Newer technology is being developed that can estimate community benthic metabolism rates over high-resolution temporal scales (< 1 h) using boundary layer techniques (i.e., eddy correlation and BEAMS) that measure oxygen and pH (Barnes and Devereux 1984;Long et al. 2013;Takeshita et al. 2016). These techniques require that we know the ratio of carbon and oxygen uptake and removal during the processes of photosynthesis and respiration (e.g., ΔDIC/ΔDO). For an organism, these values are usually seperated between day and night and known as the gross photosynthetic (PQ) and respiratory quotients (RQ), respectively. However, over daily cycles across organisms, communities, and ecosystems, the net metabolic quotient (Q) is needed for calculating metabolic rates from oxygen and pH measurements (Barnes and Devereux 1984;Takeshita et al. 2016). By measuring both oxygen and carbon fluxes, we were able to determine the net metabolic quotient for the different species in this study (Fig. 9). The net metabolic quotient (Q) was higher for crustose coralline algae (1.55 AE 0.49) than coral species (1.24 AE 0.38), which reflects elevated carbon assimilation compared to oxygen production. For corals, the metabolic quotient was similar across species (1.1-1.2), and closer to a 1 : 1 ratio, although the values still indicated a greater assimilation of carbon compared to DO production. Overall, the net metabolic quotient (Q) was 1.18 for all species and incubations combined. Interestingly, there was a trend of increasing Q with light when all corals were grouped together, indicating that the metabolic quotient may be more variable over short time scales than previously assumed (Supporting Information Fig. S10). Further understanding the influence of light on the balance of carbon assimilation to dissolved oxygen production will help to build our understanding of the reef net metabolic quotient and how it changes with light variability over hourly, daily, and seasonal cycles. More estimates of species-specific metabolic quotients for coral reef organisms will help in efforts aimed at using readily available pH and oxygen sensors to monitor the metabolism of coral communities at a greater resolution in both space and time.",False,False,False,
449,10.1002/lno.12002,24,True,"## Ratios of organic and inorganic carbon cycling in coral reef organisms
Ratios of net calcification to photosynthesis (G net /P net ) quantify the relative balance between these two processes and have been proposed to be a useful metric for reef biogeochemical function and health (Cyronak et al. 2018). Previous studies have shown that G net to P net ratios range from À8 to 17 on the organismal scale and from 0 to 0.7 on an ecosystem scale (Gattuso et al. 1999;Cyronak et al. 2018). In this study, we calculated absolute ratios of net calcification to the sum of net calcification and net photosynthesis (G net /M tot ) according to Eq. 7. We chose this metric because both calcification and production can be negative, which results in unreliable values as either the denominator or numerator approach 0. Also, we believe thatG net /M tot is more intuitive than G net /P net as it represents the relative proportion of total carbon metabolism due to calcification and ranges between 0 and 1. In all of the incubations, G net /M tot ranged from 0.03 to 0.66, which indicates that when both calcification and production are occurring production tends to dominate (Fig. 10). However, when the ratios were calculated using the metabolism-irradiance curves, G net /M tot ranged from 0 to 1 and all organisms exhibited a strong peak at the irradiance level where net photosynthesis crosses 0. This is because as net photosynthesis approaches 0 the absolute ratio comes closer to jG net j/jG net j. Ratios calculated using the model coefficients for maximum calcification and photosynthesis (i.e., net G max and net P max ) and night calcification to respiration (i.e., G dark and R) ranged from 0.11 to 0.23 and 0.06 to 0.36, respectively (Fig. 10).",False,False,False,

In fact, the highly dynamic nature of G net /M tot related to light brings into question the use of G net to P net ratios as a single, determinant value of reef function and health at the ecosystem scale (Cyronak et al. 2018). If G net /M tot do not stabilize to one consistent value on an organismal scale, it is difficult to imagine that these ratios stabilize over varying light regimes across reef communities and ecosystems made up of many calcifying and non-calcifying organisms. Future work into determining the importance and usefulness of G net /M tot as a metric for reef biogeochemical cycling is needed.",False,False,False,
451,10.1002/lno.12002,26,True,"## Conclusions
We identified patterns in the metabolism of six Caribbean benthic calcifiers under natural diurnal light cycles. Our findings support previous work showing that photosynthesis and calcification are parallel processes driven by irradiance (Gattuso et al. 2000;Cohen et al. 2016), highlighting the importance of considering natural variations in light for all reef metabolism studies. Some metabolic rates of individual species could be generalized to larger categorical groupings such as the ""massive coral"" species. However, both A. cervicornis and crustose coralline algae had similar metabolic rates despite occupying very different functional niches in coral reef accretion. While calcification and photosynthesis both fit traditional hyperbolic tangent functions with light, coefficients of the metabolism-irradiance models varied between species. Interestingly, the modeled metabolic maxima (G max and P max ) and dark calcification and respiration (G dark and R) were correlated across all photosynthesising calcifiers in this study. These correlations support the idea that energy provided by photosynthesis and respiration may be an important control on organismal calcification across different calcifying functional groups. However, mechanistic studies are needed to further address this. Understanding the dynamic species-specific balance of calcification and production could provide useful insights into estimates of community-and reefwide carbon cycles. For example, our results demonstrate that benthic surveys with simple groupings of calcifying and noncalcifying organisms could give important insights into coral reef carbon cycles. Finally, we established dynamic relationships between calcification and photosynthesis over diurnal light cycles that bring into question the application of calcification to photosynthesis ratios to monitor biogeochemical function on an ecosystem scale. Overall, the carbon cycle of coral reefs is highly dynamic at the organismal scale, driven by complex relationships between photosynthesis, respiration, calcification, and light. These relationships likely scale up and interact with other biogeochemical and hydrodynamic processes to create the intense variations in carbon chemistry observed on modern coral reefs.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
The effect of mesoscale features on the distribution of planktonic organisms are well documented. Yet, the interaction between these spatial features and the temporal scale, which can result in sudden increases of the planktonic biomass, is less known and not described at high resolution. A permanent mesoscale front in the Ligurian Sea (north-western Mediterranean) was repeatedly sampled between January and June 2021 using a SeaExplorer glider equipped with an Underwater Vision Profiler 6 (UVP6), a versatile in situ imager. Both plankton and particle distributions were resolved throughout the spring bloom to assess whether the front was a location of increased zooplankton concentration and whether it constrained particle distribution. Over the 5 months, the glider performed more than 5000 dives and the UVP6 collected 1.1 million images. We focused our analysis on shallow (300 m) transects, which gave a horizontal resolution of 900 m. About 13,000 images of planktonic organisms were retained. Ordination methods applied to particles and plankton concentrations revealed strong temporal variations during the bloom, with a succession of various zooplankton communities. Changes in particle abundance and size could be explained by changes in the plankton community. The front had a strong influence on particle distribution, while the signal was not as clear for plankton, probably because of the relatively small number of imaged organisms. This work confirms the need to sample both plankton and particles at fine scale to understand their interactions, a task for which automated in situ imaging is particularly adapted.",False,False,False,

As drifters, planktonic organisms are strongly affected by the conditions of their surrounding water mass (Hays et al. 2005). Fluctuations in phytoplankton and zooplankton concentrations occur as water conditions change over time (e.g., seasons) and space (e.g., with water displacement). More specifically, strong increases in productivity and plankton concentration are referred to as ""blooms"" (Behrenfeld and Boss 2014). Phytoplankton blooms typically occur in temperate and polar regions at the end of winter, coinciding with the cessation of deep convection and the onset of thermal stratification, which replenishes surface water nutrients (Winder and Cloern 2010;Behrenfeld 2014). Zooplankton blooms may follow through aggregation or favorable conditions enabling an increased growth rate (Graham et al. 2001). In the latter case, the zooplankton bloom takes place slightly later than the phytoplankton bloom (Heinrich 1962). Plankton blooms also impact the concentration, composition and morphology of marine snow particles (Trudnowska et al. 2021), formed through a combination of physical coagulation and zooplanktonmediated processes (Kiørboe 2001;Burd and Jackson 2009).Physical coagulation involves particle collision due to Brownian motion, differences in sinking velocity, or fluid shear; while zooplankton-mediated processes include fecal pellets production and mucus feeding webs (e.g., Appendicularia houses). Hence, both plankton and particle distributions are affected by temporal processes, often interacting with mesoscale ($ 10-100 km in space, $ 1-100 d in time) physical structures like eddies and fronts.",False,False,False,
459,10.1002/lno.12566,2,True,"Physical processes operate across various scales in the oceans, from centimeters to thousands of kilometers (Legendre and Demers 1984;Dickey 1991), shaping planktonic ecosystems structure (Haury et al. 1978;Denman and Powell 1984;Legendre and Demers 1984). Fronts and eddies, in particular, play crucial roles in plankton and particles distributions (Pinca and Dallot 1995;Turner 2015). Fronts, which separate water masses with different properties, vary widely in spatiotemporal scales: from a few hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers and from ephemeral to permanent (Owen 1981;Ferrari 2011;Lévy et al. 2018). These frontal zones are oceanic hotspots of productivity and biomass across all trophic levels (Owen 1981;McClatchie et al. 2012;Lévy et al. 2018).In a frontal-jet system, characterized by a steady geostrophic current associated with an along-current frontal structure and horizontal density gradients (Niewiadomska et al. 2008), the frontal structure can generate a submesoscale cross-frontal ageostrophic circulation directed in the sense of flattening the isopycnals (i.e., downwelling on the dense side of the front, upwelling on the light side of the front, Lévy et al. 2018). Submesoscale processes occur below the mesoscale, typically around the kilometer scale (Lévy et al. 2018). Thus, enhanced plankton biomass at the front can result either from passive organisms aggregation (Graham et al. 2001) or active mechanisms taking place after a few days, such as an increased growth rate caused by the redistribution of nutrients by the cross-frontal recirculation (Lévy et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
460,10.1002/lno.12566,3,True,"This study focuses on the northern frontal-jet system of the Ligurian Sea (north-western Mediterranean). The northern current is a geostrophic jet flowing along the coast from north-west to south-east, located about 20 km offshore and stronger between the surface and 150 m, with an average speed of 30-50 cm s À1 (Millot 1999;Niewiadomska et al. 2008;Prieur et al. 2020). Associated with this current is a permanent mesoscale front-the Ligurian front-delimited by the 38.2 and 38.8 isohalines (Boucher 1984) and going as deep as 200 m (Niewiadomska et al. 2008). This front separates offshore colder and saltier waters from coastal warmer and fresher water, delineating three distinct zones: coastal, frontal and central (Prieur et al. 2020). The Ligurian front and jet meander between 15 and 50 km away from the coast, moving at approximately 8 km per day (Piterbarg et al. 2014). Since planktonic organisms are unable to swim against currents, their distribution should be impacted by these physical features. Resolving such mesoscale distribution of planktonic organisms and physical properties during the plankton bloom requires high-resolution spatial sampling over several months, which is not achievable with ship-based sampling. Autonomous underwater vehicles, such as gliders, can be deployed to sample continuously for weeks, resolve submesoscale hydrologic features and integrate diverse miniaturized sensors (Rudnick et al. 2004), meeting the requirements of such studies. Numerous studies have examined plankton distribution across the Ligurian frontal-jet system. Early studies highlighted the relation between the spatial distribution of planktonic organisms and the physical structure of the front (Boucher 1984;Boucher et al. 1987). More specifically, the front seems to act as a barrier, constraining organisms whether in coastal or offshore waters (Pedrotti and Fenaux 1992;Molinero et al. 2008;Faillettaz et al. 2016). The front also affected the distribution of marine snow aggregates, constraining their distribution on the coastal side of the front (Gorsky et al. 2000;Stemmann et al. 2008). Finally, regarding vertical distributions, copepod communities strongly vary between stratum (Gasser et al. 1998); and the distribution of pelagic tunicates may reflect the junction of frontal convection cells (Gorsky et al. 1991). Within the Mediterranean Sea, the Ligurian Sea is one of the locations experiencing a phytoplankton spring bloom (and occasionally, a less intense autumn bloom, D'Ortenzio and Ribera d'Alcalà 2009; Mayot et al. 2017;Mayot et al. 2020), which subsequently propagates to higher trophic levels, resulting in increased concentrations of zooplankton such as copepods (Dolan and Raybaud 2020) or salps (Nival et al. 2020).",False,False,False,
461,10.1002/lno.12566,4,True,"Evidence suggests that phytoplankton blooms are influenced by the previously described frontal features. Goffart et al. (1995) observed a more intense bloom at the front, with phytoplankton transported downward by the frontal convergence following the isopycnals. As described above, submesoscale frontal features can influence phytoplankton distribution and growth (Lévy et al. 2018). Glider surveys of the Ligurian front detected vertical transport of surface waters enriched in chlorophyll, highlighting such effect (Niewiadomska et al. 2008). Investigating how these effects propagate to higher trophic levels (e.g., zooplankton, larval fish) thus requires studying their distribution at the same resolution as phytoplankton. This fine-scale resolution captures interactions between planktonic organisms, as well as interactions with their physicochemical environment. Several studies already targeted zooplankton distribution at such scales: Luo et al. (2014) showed that the distribution of various gelatinous organisms across a mesoscale front was driven by temperature, depth, oxygen, or chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration depending on the taxonomic group. Similarly, Greer et al. (2015) showed increased abundance of both zooplankton and larval fish on the shelf side of a shelf-slope front. Finally, Greer et al. (2013) revealed the interaction between phytoplankton fine layers and zooplanktonic grazers. The common denominator between these studies is that they rely on in situ imaging.",False,False,False,
462,10.1002/lno.12566,5,True,"Traditional plankton sampling instruments (nets and pumps) are inadequate for resolving the fine-scale distribution of planktonic organisms in relation to their immediate environment. They lack spatiotemporal resolution because they integrate organisms over tow distance and/or depth. Furthermore, plankton sampling is often performed separately from environmental data recording (Cowen and Guigand 2008;Lombard et al. 2019). In addition, fragile organisms can be damaged during sampling, resulting in underestimated concentrations (Remsen et al. 2004). The development of in situ imaging instruments overcame some of these limitations: they resolve the fine-scale distribution of planktonic organisms within their environment and allow the detection of physicobiological relationships, while preserving organisms and enabling in situ behavior observation (Mars Brisbin et al. 2020;Orenstein et al. 2021;Vilgrain et al. 2021). However, this comes at the cost of some taxonomic resolution and of a large data processing effort. The Underwater Vision Profiler 6 (UVP6) (Picheral et al. 2021) is one of these in situ imagers, targeting mostly zooplankton and large phytoplankton colonies. Compared to the previous generation (UVP5) (Picheral et al. 2010), the UVP6 is smaller and can be deployed on autonomous platforms (e.g., float, glider).In this work, we leverage in situ imaging collected by a glider to tackle the following questions: what are the physical and biological properties of the Ligurian front; what are the dynamics of particles and plankton distribution across the front during the spring bloom of 2021?",False,False,False,

## Glider and UVP6
Sampling was performed with a Seaexplorer (Alseamar) glider, an autonomous underwater vehicle taking advantage of buoyancy variations to glide forward through the water in a sawtooth-like pattern, surfacing periodically to ensure data transmission and GPS positioning. The glider was fitted with a set of sensors to record temperature, salinity, fluorescence, particles backscattering at 700 nm (BB700), color dissolved organic matter (CDOM) and dissolved oxygen concentration. The glider was also equipped with a UVP6-LP, consisting of a main camera and a light unit illuminating a slice of water for an image volume of 0.67 liter, with an adaptable imaging rate of up to 1.3 Hz (Picheral et al. 2021). With a pixel size of 73 μm, it captures images of plankton and marine snow above 600 μm and counts particles above 80 μm in equivalent spherical diameter (ESD). When embedded on a Seaexplorer glider, the UVP6-LP is deployed in supervised mode and is controlled by the glider using a preset configuration (out of 10 possible), with the ability to update settings remotely. While the UVP6 operated both during downcasts and upcasts, sunlight interference is possible below the surface during daily and very sunny upcasts. To mitigate this, black images were regularly recorded to identify increased noise levels caused by sunlight. Images acquired in such conditions were discarded, resulting in the absence of data above $40 m during daytime upcasts. Finally, depth-averaged current was estimated using navigation data from the glider: by comparing its estimated position with GPS fixes upon surfacing, any deviation was attributed to the depth-averaged current affecting the glider navigation.",False,False,False,

The glider was deployed outside of Villefranche Bay (43 39 0 18 00 N, 7 17 0 24 00 E, referred as to ""coast""), heading towards the Dyfamed point (43 22 0 02 00 N, 7 55 0 59 00 E). Sampling consisted of repeated transects, crossing nearly perpendicularly the Ligurian front. The glider performed round-trips between the coast and Dyfamed, conduction 10 missions from before (28 January 2021) to after (28 June 2021) the spring bloom (Fig. 1). Each mission (12-14 d each) consisting of two round trips from the coast. During outbound journeys, the glider's trajectory slightly adjusted into the current and it dove down to 600 m to avoid the strong surface (< 150 m depth) jet. On return trips, the target depth was reduced to 300 m to increase horizontal resolution, with a median distance of 900 m between surfacing events. The UVP6 acquisition rate was set to 0.2 Hz below 220 m and to 0.5 Hz above (1.3 Hz for the last two missions), resulting in a sampling rate between## Panaïotis et al.Plankton across a mesoscale front 0.14 and 0.91 L s À1 . During the 10 missions, the glider spent 2790 h at sea, the UVP6 capturing a total of 1,123,123 images. However, 30% of these images were captured near the coast when the glider was in virtual mooring (i.e., performing dives but staying in a designated location, heading against the current) before recovery.",False,False,False,

Positional data First, each transect was separated into ""out"" and ""back"" parts based on surfacing position and only back parts (with higher horizontal resolution) were retained. The resolution of ""out"" parts of transects ($ 2 km between surfacing events) was too low to investigate the effects of the front on plankton distribution. This resulted in a total of 20 transects (Fig. 1). As each transect lasted more than 24 h, it is not always possible to clearly determine whether a given signal is due to space (e.g., frontal zone) or time (e.g., daytime vs. nighttime). GPS positioning being available only when the glider was surfacing, geographical coordinates were linearly interpolated during dives, each consisting of a down and an upcast. Latitude and longitude were then used to compute the distance from shore (reference point at Nice cape, 43 41 0 9 00 N, 7 18 0 17 00 E).",False,False,False,
466,10.1002/lno.12566,9,True,"## Plankton images
Images captured by the UVP6 during cruising (n = 785,405) were first imported into the Morphocluster application (Schröder et al. 2020) to quickly detect large clusters of similar objects. This allowed sorting more than 400,000 objects, mostly detritus, in a few hours. In a 2 nd step, images collected during back transects (the focus of this study, n = 434,129), were imported onto the EcoTaxa web application (Picheral et al. 2017) with their Morphocluster label in order to be sorted into finer taxonomic or morphological groups (marine snow, artifact, badfocus, reflection, or unidentifiable) with the help of supervised machine learning. Still, sorting all 400k+ images would have required a multiple-month effort and we instead decided to rely on the predictions of a Random Forest (RF) classifier fed with both handcrafted and deep (i.e., generated by the feature extractor part of a convolutional neural network [CNN]) features generated by a MobileNet V2 (Sandler et al. 2019) feature extractor previously finetuned on UVP6 data. We selected a RF classifier because they tend to produce good classification probability estimates (Niculescu-Mizil and Caruana 2005), are faster to train than a full CNN stack and perform as well as a full CNN when trained with deep features (E. Amblard pers. comm.).",False,False,False,
467,10.1002/lno.12566,10,True,"Classification performance was assessed on an independent test set (n = 42,595) not used for training. This test set was built to be representative of the whole dataset by selecting 1 out of 10 profiles, equally distributed across the mission. Unsurprisingly, the test set was dominated by detritus (n > 40,000) but still contained around 100 objects or more per category for a few taxonomic groups (Copepoda, Appendicularia, Rhizaria, Salpida), allowing to compute reliable classification performance metrics. This revealed relatively poor precision performance for a few groups, including Appendicularia and Rhizaria (Supporting Information Table S2). To improve precision, at the expense of recall, and ensure that observed patterns were genuine, we applied a probability threshold (Faillettaz et al. 2016) on classification scores. This threshold, set independently for each class, ensured that objects predicted in a given class with a score above the threshold actually belonged to this class for at least 75% of them (i.e., targeting a precision of 75%, Supporting Information Table S3), discarding images with a prediction score below the threshold. However, this approach strongly decreased recall for Appendicularia and Rhizaria, impeding the detection of any distribution pattern. Consequently, the probability threshold was not applied to these classes, that were instead fully inspected and manually validated (n = 1500), resulting in 100% precision (all objects assigned to one of these classes do belong to the assigned class) without decreasing recall. Counts of objects per taxonomic group and per particle size class were divided by water volumes sampled to compute concentrations (# m À3 ) within 5 m bins along the glider trajectory.",False,False,False,

First, abnormal values (e.g., negative fluorescence) were discarded. Density was computed from temperature and salinity using the ""gsw"" R package version 1.1.1. For each variable, outliers were detected according to deviation around the median (Leys et al. 2013) and removed. Oxygen concentrations were adjusted by subtracting a 52 μmol kg À1 offset, derived from comparisons with values recorded simultaneously at Dyfamed. Data were linearly interpolated at 1 m resolution to fill in missing values. Each variable was smoothed using a moving average within a window size of 25 m. Data were then binned over 5 m to match the plankton and particles data bins.## Data analysis Particles
First, particle concentrations for 13 size classes between 102 μm (the 1 st class entirely above the detection threshold of 80 μm) and 2.05 mm (larger classes contained too few particles and were thus noisy) were averaged onto 10 m Â 1 km bins to reduce noise and normalized with log-transformation to avoid very high values. A principal component analysis (PCA) was then performed to summarize these concentrations, scaled to unit variance so that each size class equally contributed to the construction of the factorial space. Supplementary variables (biogeochemical variables and metadata)-not used to compute the PCA space-were projected onto the PCA space to help with the interpretation. Finally, scores of objects were visualized on transects.",False,False,False,
469,10.1002/lno.12566,12,True,"## Plankton
A PCA was also performed to synthesize plankton concentrations. Because of the scarcity of the plankton compared to the > 80 μm particles, plankton concentrations were first averaged across 30 m Â 5 km bins, resulting in a median water volume of 373 liters (Q1 = 183 liters, Q3 = 573 liters) per bin.Still, many bins lacked plankton, resulting in a zero-inflated distribution. To address this, only bins where plankton was present were considered, and the average value for each variable (i.e., concentrations of plankton groups) was assigned to empty bins to ensure they did not distort PCA space. All concentrations were log(n + 1)-transformed to normalize them and standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation (Legendre and Legendre 2012), so that each taxon contributed equally to the construction of the PCA space.This PCA (Supporting Information Fig. S8) highlighted the importance of a few taxonomic groups: Copepoda and Eumalacostraca emerged on PC1, Salpida, Mollusca and Appendicularia on PC2, and multiple Rhizaria subgroups on PC3. We decided to focus our analyses on four groups based on their abundance (Supporting Information Fig. S7) and their importance in the PCA: Copepoda, Appendicularia, Salpida, and Rhizaria other than Collodaria and Foraminifera (since this group of other Rhizaria taxa was the most abundant and was representative of all three Rhizaria groups, since they had close projections in the PCA space).## Visualization
Four transect representatives of the dynamics of the bloom (Fig. 1) were chosen from the available 20 to offer a condensed view in the main manuscript. However, supplementary material includes all 20 transects (Supporting Information Fig. S1, S5, S8, S9, and S10).All analyses were conducted with R version 4.1.2.

Transect maps (Fig. 2) show that the Ligurian current was stronger in late winter and early spring, and weakened later in the spring. Although globally oriented NE to SW, changes in current direction on 20 March 2021 (top-left panel in Fig. 2) highlights the presence of a meander. The first presented transect (starting on 27 February) revealed a rather homogeneous temperature over the water column (Fig. 3; Supporting Information Fig. S1). At the surface, the front was located between 20 and 30 km offshore, and separated fresher waters inshore from saltier waters offshore, as expected. Fluorescence highlighted an intense bloom at the surface in offshore waters. Chlorophyll-enriched water was detected down to 300 m, well below the photic zone, thus corresponding to a downwelling of water enriched in chlorophyll that seemed to follow the front. This feature was also clearly visible on salinity, oxygen and CDOM, strongly suggesting a movement of a whole water mass. Finally, inshore waters were well oxygenated down to 300 m. The 2 nd transect (20 March) displayed similar features except for fluorescence: an important mixing event was detected, down to 200 m, where no photosynthesis can take place. This event was also visible on oxygen and CDOM concentrations. This mixing event was likely caused by strong winds the day before (Supporting Information Fig. S3). On the 3 rd transect (22 April), a weak stratification appeared in coastal waters and the 38.2 and 38.3 isohalines delimiting the front became more horizontal. Fluorescence was lower at the very surface than in the waters below, hinting at the formation of a deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM). A lens of colder and fresher water was located 50 km offshore, between 150 and 300 m depth, and was also characterized by higher oxygen and lower CDOM. Finally, on 24 June, the water column was well stratified, with sharp thermocline and pycnocline. The isohalines, and thus the front, were nearly horizontal. The DCM was well established between 50 and 100 m (also visible on BB700), with higher chlorophyll concentration and higher chlorophyll to BB700 ratio offshore, indicating a higher concentration of phytoplankton cells. Oxygenated waters were restricted to the surface, above the DCM. These features are emblematic of the oligotrophic environment during summer in the Ligurian Sea.",False,False,False,

For particles, the first two axes of the PCA captured 83.9% of variance, most of it (60.2%) being on the 1 st axis (Fig. 4A). This axis separated high particle concentrations, associated with coastal waters characterized by high BB700, oxygen and fluorescence, from low particle concentrations, associated with offshore, deep, salty, and dense waters. The 2 nd axis discriminated between size classes. PC1 projections (Fig. 4B) highlighted a decrease in particle concentration decrease over time, while PC2 projections (Fig. 4C) revealed contrasted patterns in particle size. On 27 February and 20 March, coastal areas exhibited greater particles abundance, with larger particles correlating with the downwelling event detected on fluorescence (Fig. 3). Particles were larger offshore than inshore (Fig. 4C). On 22 April, particle concentration was much lower, except in very coastal waters, highlighting the near absence of particle export. Large particles were present in the 0-100 m depth layer, around the forming DCM, but not below. Finally, on 24 June, the DCM was associated with abundant small particles, likely phytoplankton cells or particles produced through biological activity; while a rain of larger particles was detected offshore, below the DCM. The circadian cycle did not seem to affect neither particle distribution nor size in any transect.## Plankton distribution
Concentration plots for the selected taxa highlighted changes in the zooplankton community (Fig. 5; Supporting Information Fig. S10). Copepods and appendicularians dominated close to the surface in February, especially offshore. In March, copepod abundance intensified, while appendicularians declined, replaced by salps at the top of the water column on the offshore side of the front. A 2 nd peak in Appendicularia abundance occurred in April, while salps were still present. In June, rhizarians became more abundant in the entire water column while copepods, appendicularians and salps were less abundant.

473,10.1002/lno.12566,16,True,"## Discussion
## Plankton and sampled volumes
Due to the low sampling rate (≤ 0.9 L s À1 ), very few planktonic organisms were imaged, with just 13,000 being confidently predicted for analysis. Thus, many sampled bins lacked, resulting in a weaker signal compared to particles data. Overall, only 17,000 objects were predicted as plankton, such that manual validation of all plankton groups would have only added 4000 organisms (+30%), likely not affecting our results. Still, we cannot exclude that planktonic organisms were predicted as detritus, necessitating the inspection of > 400,000 images. Despite an increased sampling rate towards the end of the mission (from 0.35 to 0.91 L s À1 , the maximum achievable for the UVP6-LP) in the 0-220-m layer, this was still insufficient to investigate fine scale plankton distribution. To resolve such scales, the UVP6-LP would need to be run at its highest rate of 1.3 Hz instead of 0.2 and 0.5 Hz during this experiment (the last two deployments were indeed run at a sampling rate of 1.3 Hz); or a UVP6-HF (high frequency, Picheral et al. 2021) capable of sampling at 20 Hz, albeit with higher energy consumption and reduced glider autonomy (e.g., only one round-trip per deployment). Still, our work confirms the effectiveness of autonomous underwater vehicle such as glider fitted with in situ imager to sample both the environment, particles and plankton at fine scale over extended durations. Nonetheless, as mentioned above, attention to sampling resolution, particularly that of the imager, is crucial for achieving research objectives.",False,False,False,

475,10.1002/lno.12566,18,True,"## Challenges posed by temporal and spatial variabilities
Overall, the data collected by the glider consist of repeated $ 50 km transects over several months. However, these transects, averaging 51 h, do not always allow clear differentiation between spatial and temporal features, for example, whether a signal is caused by the diel cycle or by location relative to the front. To detect purely spatial effects, transects should be sampled as snapshots, as permitted by towed instruments such as the In Situ Ichthyoplankton Imaging System (ISIIS) (Cowen and Guigand 2008), which can cover several dozen kilometers in a few hours. Furthermore, such instruments are little affected by water movement, whereas gliders can be strongly affected by currents, leading us to reconsider our original sampling strategy of sampling 0-200 m during backward transects. However, continuous sampling for 5 months is not feasible with a towed instrument, while gliders offer reasonable human costs. Conversely, for purely temporal effects, fixed-positions timeseries are required. Glider sampling lies between these two extremes views (space vs time), offering better spatial resolution than timeseries but falling short of snapshot transects' spatial resolution. Nevertheless, repeated transects offer temporal insight of observed features, which is much more difficult with single-transect approaches (Niewiadomska et al. 2008). External clues also aid interpretation (e.g., relating the downwelling observed on 20 March to preceding wind event).Moreover, spatial features also evolve temporally: the intensity of the Ligurian current varies seasonally (more intense in winter) while meandering induces variability (Millot 1999). Finally, another difficulty arises from the short-lived nature (usually < 1 d) of targeted submesoscale features. Although we detect two submesoscale coherent vortices (SCV, discussed below), including one that was sampled twice, such events are sporadic, likely missing many other opportunities. The same goes for plankton and particle distribution, we did capture some spatial and temporal features but presumably missed many others.",False,False,False,
476,10.1002/lno.12566,19,True,"## Effects of the diel cycle
Space and time variations could not be disentangled. However, the PC projections did not seem affected by day/night variations, indicating little influence from the diel cycle. Two tests were performed to assess this hypothesis. First, average plankton concentrations along glider yos were computed, and differences between day and night yos were investigated with a Wilcoxon test. This highlighted day/night differences in average concentration over 0-300 m for several taxa (Supporting Information Fig. S11A). Then, average vertical distributions on 30-m bins were computed for day and night and compared with a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, revealing significant differences for Foraminifera only (Supporting Information Fig. S11B). The UVP6 (former version of the sensor) being dazzled by the sunlight in the upper part of the water column (depth < 40 m) when ascending, no concentration of particle or plankton were computed in this zone. As no data are available to compare with night values at these depths, even though many taxa are known to migrate within this depth range, we tested the relative effect of both environmental variables and a binary day/night variable on plankton concentration in the 30-60 m depth range, using a nonlinear model (Boosted Regression Trees). For each of the four taxa, the day/night effect explained less than 8% of total variance. Overall, the little effect of the diel cycle on plankton distributions likely results from the low number of detected organisms and the averaging across relatively large bins.",False,False,False,

Surface Chl a data in the area covered by the glider show a sudden increase on 23 February (Supporting Information Fig. S2), likely corresponding to the beginning of the phytoplankton bloom. UVP6 data indicate that the zooplankton bloom began somewhere between 20 February and 27 February, although precision is limited by our data, but the zooplankton bloom typically following the phytoplankton bloom, the latter part of this interval is more likely. Nonetheless, a physical aggregation of zooplankton could have occurred earlier than the start of the ""true"" bloom, that is, increased growth rate. As described below, variations observed in particle abundance and size seems to indicate that particulate organic carbon (POC) export was affected by the composition of the plankton community, as previously reported by numerous studies (Boyd andNewton 1995, 1999;Guidi et al. 2009Guidi et al. , 2016)). Indeed, zooplanktonic organisms are directly involved in POC production (Turner 2015;Steinberg and Landry 2017). Four phases emerged from the analysis particle and plankton distribution and are discussed below.",False,False,False,
478,10.1002/lno.12566,21,True,"## Early bloom-February
In February, the early phase of the zooplankton bloom was characterized by the presence of Appendicularia, including both inhabited and discarded houses, mostly in the 0-200-m layer. Appendicularia-filter-feeding pelagic tunicates-grow a mucopolysaccharides and cellulose house used as an external mucous filter to collect food particles (Alldredge and Madin 1982). The house is disposable: when filters obstruct, it is discarded and renewed (up to several times a day, Sato et al. 2003), contributing significantly to marine snow aggregates (Alldredge and Silver 1988). These large (3 mm ESD on average) particles have a relatively low sinking velocity (20-50 m d À1 ) during the 1 st hour, which then increases to 100 m per day after their initial deflation (Lombard and Kiørboe 2010). High Appendicularia abundance was previously linked to increased export of large particles, mostly through discarded houses (Alldredge et al. 2005). Thus, the displacement event of large particles, along the isopycnals (Fig. 3) could correspond to these discarded houses, or fecal pellets, from Appendicularia.## Mid bloom-March
In a 2 nd phase, copepods dominated the 0-200-m layer while salps occupied the 0-100-m layer. Large particles, though fewer than in February, were primarily offshore. Strong wind was recorded a few days before this transect (Supporting Information Fig. S3), causing a mixing of the water column and a redistribution of phytoplankton (likely responsible for the lower Chl a concentration than in February, through dilution effect), particles (Figs. 1DG, 3BC) and possibly zooplankton (see pattern of copepods in Fig. 4A). Such events have previously been reported during spring and can result in community changes both for phytoplankton (Thyssen et al. 2014) and zooplankton (Romagnan et al. 2015).",False,False,False,
479,10.1002/lno.12566,22,True,"## Late bloom-April
In April, the concentration of appendicularians increased, while that of copepods decreased. This gelatinous bloom could be the result of favorable conditions following the wind gust 2 weeks earlier (20 March), aligning with findings by Ménard et al. (1994) who found that wind promoted blooms of salps, although this result could not be confirmed by Licandro et al. (2006). Concurrently, stratification began in coastal waters and the DCM started to form. The water column was mostly depleted in particles (except for very coastal waters). Particles present in the 0-100-m layer were rather big, a result of a decline in small particles concentration (Supporting Information Fig. S6). Further analyses showed that only 10% of objects in the 1-2 mm size range were living organisms, confirming that these large objects are indeed particles and not planktonic organisms such as appendicularians, more abundant in the same depth range. These large particles, distributed along the isopycnals, raised questions regarding particle dynamics. A 1 st hypothesis could be a lack of aggregation, so that organic matter would remain in the form of small particles (< 80 μm) undetected by the UVP6. However, backscattering measurements (targeting particles around 10 μm), also show low abundance in the water column on 22 April 22 (Fig. 2; Supporting Information Fig. S1), challenging this explanation. Alternatively, the decrease in small particles might be caused filter-feeding tunicates such as salps and appendicularians in the water column. Both taxa contribute to particles (1 μm to 1 mm) removal (Alldredge and Madin 1982) and aggregation into larger sinking particles, explaining the relative dominance of large particles. While fecal pellets produced by salps are relatively large ($ 5 mm) and fast sinking ($ 2000 m d À1 , Bruland and Silver 1981), recently discarded houses of appendicularians (containing fecal pellets) sink very slowly (< 50 m d À1 , Lombard and Kiørboe 2010). These particles are thus much likely to reside in the water column, by sitting on density gradients.",False,False,False,
480,10.1002/lno.12566,23,True,"## After bloom-June
Finally, both stratification and DCM intensified while zooplankton concentration decreased (Fig. 2). Rhizaria dominated the zooplankton community, with some of them being mixotrophic and typical of oligotrophic environments (Biard et al. 2016). We mostly detected small unidentifiable Rhizaria and solitary Collodaria. The analysis of a time series of the complete plankton assemblage from net samples collected in Villefranche Bay highlighted a peak of Rhizaria in July (Romagnan et al. 2015), in oligotrophic conditions that are comparable with our transect at the end of June. The fine-scale distribution of these organisms during the oligotrophic summer was previously studied across the Ligurian front, using the ISIIS, an in situ imager with very high sampling rate (> 100 L s À1 ) (Cowen and Guigand 2008). Solitary Collodaria precisely followed the DCM, while Acantharia were mostly found on the coastal side in the upper 50 m of the water column (Faillettaz et al. 2016). Such patterns could not be resolved with the UVP6, mostly because of its lower sampling rate (< 1 L s À1 ), which required to aggregate observations into broader taxonomic groups and onto a much coarser spatial grid. Particle distribution revealed more abundant and smaller particles around the DCM, which could correspond to large phytoplanktonic cells (> 100 μm) or the accumulation of particles related to biological activity.",False,False,False,

Previous studies reported a strong influence of the front on the distribution of particles with small aggregates being more abundant in coastal waters while large aggregates were more abundant in the frontal zone, likely formed through physical coagulation or biological transformation (Gorsky et al. 2002;Stemmann et al. 2008). Moreover, large particles being more abundant in surface waters suggests local formation before downward export (Stemmann et al. 2002). Our study corroborates these findings, with small aggregates more abundant in coastal waters and the front acting as a barrier to particles spreading offshore, a consistent pattern throughout the blooming phase. Furthermore, mean aggregate concentrations (0.75 L À1 in 512 μm to 1.02 mm; 0.09 L À1 in 1.02-2.05 mm) closely matched previous observations (Stemmann et al. 2002).

Many studies detected an effect of the front on planktonic organisms distribution, either an increase in abundance or biomass at the front (Boucher 1984;Boucher et al. 1987;Molinero et al. 2008;Licandro and Icardi 2009) or different concentrations of certain taxa on either side of the front (Pedrotti and Fenaux 1992;Molinero et al. 2008;Faillettaz et al. 2016). Such effects were less evident in our data. First, the coarse spatial resolution imposed by the UVP6-LP sampling rate made it difficult to identify processes ""at the front."" As mentioned above, the use of a UVP6-HF with a higher sampling rate could have enhanced the detection of front-related effects on plankton distribution. Second, the coarse taxonomic resolution may have hidden some underlying differences within broad taxonomic groups (e.g., copepods). Finally, the proximity of the current to the coast for most of the study period resulted in limited sampling of coastal communities, making them difficult to contrast with offshore ones. Still, the concentration of several taxa was higher in the offshore region than in the current or in the coastal one: copepods in February and March, appendicularians in February and April, salps in March and April (Fig. 4), which is compatible with a potential barrier effect of the front.",False,False,False,

During the back transect on 22 April, a SCV (referred hereafter as L3) was identified. Spanning 9 km Â 200 m, located between 46 and 55 km offshore and at depths from 130 to $ 300 m, it consisted of cold, freshwater with high oxygen and low CDOM concentrations, but was barely visible on density and BB700 (Fig. 3). Similar structures were looked for in the whole dataset, including outgoing transects. The same structure, albeit smaller (5 km width, labeled L2 in Supporting Information Fig. S4), was crossed 17 h earlier on the outgoing transect on 20 April. Another similar structure (L1), closer to the coast, was detected on the same outgoing transect but not captured before during the previous back transect, performed 25 h before. This provides insight into its drift speed, estimated at 5-10 cm s À1 , assuming the same dimension in x and y axes. Previous detection of SCV in the area (Bosse et al. 2017) highlighted differences in physico-biogeochemical properties (more oxygen, less nutrients) compared to surrounding waters, affecting the phytoplankton community and highlighting reduced lateral exchanges between the core of the SCV and the surroundings (Bosse et al. 2017). However, no significant effect of the SCV on particle concentration or size was detected (Supporting Information Fig. S5), suggesting a limited barrier effect for particles.

On 27 February, a water mass with high chlorophyll, high oxygen, low salinity, low temperature and low CDOM was recorded down to a depth of 300 m (Fig. 2; Supporting Information S1). This layer, about 3.8 km in width and 20 m in height, was sinking toward the coast, following the isopycnals along the front. This is coherent with a convergence event (Boucher et al. 1987) and was already observed by Niewiadomska et al. (2008) from glider data collected on a similar transect across the Ligurian front in January. They detected a similar water mass, 4 km wide, subducting to 180 m depth. Analogous features were reported during spring in the Corsican side of the Ligurian current: phytoplankton produced in the surface layer was carried downward along the isopycnals, forming a plume of chlorophyll down to 100 m (Goffart et al. 1995). Here, we additionally demonstrate that this instability-driven sinking water mass also carried more and bigger particles from the surface toward the depth, while it was previously only suggested that particles could be transported downward by the frontal circulation along the isopycnals (Gorsky et al. 1991).",False,False,False,

In conclusion, repeated sections across the Ligurian front conducted with a glider allowed us to resolve submesoscale Panaïotis et al.Plankton across a mesoscale front hydrological features. A clear link emerged between the environment, the distribution of particles and, to some extent, that of planktonic organisms, for example, in a subducting water mass and during a mixing event. Moreover, the accumulation along isopycnals creates the DCM in April and July, reflected in the distribution of particles. Strong changes were detected in plankton distribution during the blooming period, with a succession of different zooplankton communities throughout the bloom. These changes were also related to changes in the abundance and size of marine snow particles.Although the front exhibited a consistent influence on marine snow particle distribution throughout the sampling period, the signal was coarser for planktonic organisms, probably due to the low sampling rate, resulting in a limited number of imaged organisms. Overall, these results confirm the need to study physics, biogeochemistry and biology at the same scale, by sampling both the environment, particles and plankton at fine scale using in situ imaging. This approach should allow to better understand the biological responses to submesoscale hydrological forcings.### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1. Schedule of the 10 glider missions.

## Abstract
Heatwaves affect tidal flat ecosystems by altering the bioturbating behavior of benthic species, with potential consequences for sediment oxygenation, particle mixing, and erodibility. Although the frequency and duration of heatwaves are expected to increase under global warming scenarios, we lack insights into how heatwaves' temporal dynamics affect bioturbating behaviors. Using the widely distributed bioturbator Cerastoderma edule as model species, we quantified how heatwaves with identical heat-sum but different temporal dynamics (i.e., 3-vs. 6-d heating and normal temperature cycles) affect bioturbating behaviors and the sediment mixing processes in tidal mesocosms. Our results show that short but frequent 3-d heatwave cycles increased the magnitude of bioturbating behaviors, thereby resulting in more bio-mixed sediment than observed under infrequent prolonged 6-d heatwave cycles. This unexpected result could be ascribed to the weakening health condition indicated by a high death rate (47.37%) under 6-d heatwave cycles than in 3-d and no-heatwave control cycles. Present findings reveal that the impact of heatwaves on sediment bioturbation will strongly depend on the temporal dynamics of future heatwaves: bioturbation will be enhanced unless the heatwave duration exceeds species resistance and increases mortality.",False,False,False,
492,10.1002/lno.12332,1,True,"## Untitled Section
Bioturbation is the process of sediment reworking by living organisms (Darwin 1881). Bioturbators are classified as ecosystem engineers (Jones et al. 1997;Wright and Jones 2006) because they can excessively modify the physical properties of sediments (e.g., compaction, bulk density, and particle distribution) and the diffusion rate of chemical compounds (Braeckman et al. 2010;Kristensen et al. 2012;Cozzoli et al. 2021) via foraging (Wrede et al. 2018) and building behaviors (Borsje et al. 2014). From terrestrial fields to deepsea sediments, bioturbation plays a significant role in changing the surface landscape of our planet (Meysman et al. 2006). Across the globe, tidal flats are one of the most renowned ecosystems dominated by a wide range of bioturbating benthic species (Teal et al. 2008;van der Wal et al. 2017), and hence the focus of the present study.",True,False,False,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **tidal flats**. 

They are defined by being **dominated by a wide range of bioturbating benthic species**. The context does not mention any specific *quantitative* attributes, only a descriptive characteristic of species composition."
493,10.1002/lno.12332,2,True,"The physical conditions for living on tidal flats are typically harsh in that they constantly change due to tidal cycles of drying and inundation. By interacting with physical forces from currents and waves, some bioturbators actively flush their burrows to refill oxygen and nutrients (Mermillod-Blondin and Rosenberg 2006;Hedman et al. 2011). These burrows thus become networks to promote chemical exchange at watersediment interfaces (i.e., benthic-pelagic coupling). Moreover, bioturbators loosen the sediment and increase the surface roughness (Widdows and Brinsley 2002;Li et al. 2017). Hydrodynamic forces may reshape these biologically induced topographies during tidal inundation, resulting in enhanced sediment resuspension and erosion (Montserrat et al. 2009;Cozzoli et al. 2019;Dairain et al. 2020). For example, the common cockle Cerestoderma edule can affect sediment stability through vertical and horizontal movements such as shell shaking, adductions, and excreting feces. These bioturbating activities can lead to more erosion in cohesive sediment (Widdows et al. 2000;Le Hir et al. 2007;Li et al. 2017). Understanding the effect of benthic bioturbators on sediment erodibility is essential, as short-term transitions between erosion and accretion may affect the longterm stability of tidal flat ecosystems (e.g., see Bouma et al. 2016;Shi et al. 2021).",False,False,False,
494,10.1002/lno.12332,3,True,"Tidal flat ecosystems worldwide are declining and may be increasingly threatened by global change processes (Murray et al. 2019). Recent studies show that 50% of the ocean surface water may suffer from marine heatwaves by the late 21 st century (Holbrook et al. 2019). Tidal flat ecosystems are expected to be much more prone to such heatwaves since the surface sediments can experience a daily temperature difference of more than 10 C during the low-tide emersion time (Johnson 1965;Bouchet et al. 2007;Li et al. 2019), despite that the seasonal variation can be more than 30 C from summer to winter (Murphy and Reidenbach 2016). Goulletquer et al. (1998) even measure a daily temperature increment of 23 C in the oyster reef. Bioturbators living on tidal flats are prone to extreme temperature fluctuations, particularly those inhabiting higher intertidal areas (Pansch et al. 2018). Occasional exposure to heatwaves can decrease the health conditions of the benthic bioturbators living on tidal flats (Coma et al. 2009;Pairaud et al. 2014;Rivetti et al. 2014). Thermal stress typically promotes the bioturbators' metabolic rates (Anestis et al. 2007;Vinagre et al. 2016), which positively relates to their moving behavior (Cozzoli et al. 2019). More movements may increase sediment bio-mixing and a reduced critical erosion threshold on the tidal flat scale (Cozzoli et al. 2020). Thus, to predict the future fate of tidal flat ecosystems, it is necessary to better understand how future heatwaves affect benthos' bioturbation behaviors.",False,False,False,
495,10.1002/lno.12332,4,True,"Like most abiotic stresses and disturbances in the natural environment, the effect of heatwaves may be expected to depend on their magnitude, duration, and frequency (Donohue et al. 2016).

For example, Seuront et al. (2019) show that 100% mortality for the mussel Mytilus edulis occurred at lower temperatures with increasing duration of exposure to heatwaves. Global warming not only leads to a higher heatwave intensity, but also amplifies the temporal dynamics of heatwaves.

A mesocosm experiment was performed in a climate room to simulate natural heatwaves on tidal flats.

The upper tank was filled with 30-cm-high sand (SD50 = 265.02 μm) as a basement that contained the experimental treatments; the lower tank was used as a water reservoir for simulations of tidal cycles (for details, see Zhou et al. 2022). The experimental treatments created a high tide by pumping water from the lower reservoir tank into the upper tank. The water height was adjusted by a return-flow pipe (30 cm height), transporting the overflow water back to the lower tank. Low tide was created by turning off the pump to drain all water into the lower reservoir tank.

Four mesocosms were placed in the same climate room, of which two were used for simulated heatwave treatments and the other two as ambient temperature controls. According to temperature measurements in the field during the 2020 summertime heatwaves (see Supporting Information Appendix S1, Fig. SA1a), we set the maximal temperature of the sediment surface at 35 C and the ambient temperature at a constant 20 C. Terrace heaters (Frico, EZ212) were used to mimic solar irradiation during low tide. A thermal probe was placed on top of the sediment to control the heater temperature by real-time measurements: when the temperature of the sediment surface reached 35 C, the heater was turned off; when it dropped below 35 C, it was turned on again.Due to delays in the control system, the actual mean temperature was 32.23 AE 1.61 C (see Supporting Information Appendix S1, Fig. SA1b, red lines); the actual mean ambient temperature was 16.42 AE 0.35 C (Fig. SA1b, blue lines).

The heaters were turned off during the night.To measure the temperature profiles in each tank, two extra PVC pots (no cockles inside) were made to hold the temperature sensors (PT-100 sensors, TC Direct). These sensors were deployed at fixed depths of 0, 3, and 6 cm to record the perminute temperature profiles in the PVC pots, and they were used to represent the temperature profiles of all pots in the same tank. All temperature sensors were connected to a CR10X datalogger (Campbell Scientific Inc.), and the data was transferred via LoggerNet software (Campbell Scientific Inc.).

The common cockle C. edule is widely distributed along the European Atlantic coastline. The cockles used in this experiment were collected from Oesterdam, the Netherlands, in late September 2020. They were transported to a temperaturecontrolled climate room set at 20 C and left in a tank filled with aerated seawater for 120 h acclimation. Then, living cockles were transferred into PVC pots filled with sediment and placed in the tidal mesocosms, allowing them to acclimate to the new environment for another 72 h before starting the heatwave treatments.

Onethird of the seawater in the reservoir tanks was replaced every week to guarantee good water quality throughout the experiment. Dead cockles on the sediment surface were removed every day.

The median grain size (SD50) of the luminophores was 41 μm. The color of the luminophores was ""magenta red"" under normal ambient light, with shining luminosity in a dark environment under UV light. Sieved (Ø = 1000 μm) ambient sediment (SD50 = 158 μm) and luminophores were mixed at a volume ratio of 10 : 1 with water (i.e., water weight was determined by the bulk density of ambient sediment). Then, the sediment-luminophore-water mixture was poured into PVC molds of 70 Â 70 Â 0.5 mm (i.e., inner diameter = 67 mm) and froze at À20 C to make luminophore ""tablets"".Luminophore tablets were placed on top of each PVC pot during low tide for all treatments, namely, ""heatwaves (i.e., FS 3 and IL 6 ),"" ""control,"" and ""blank."" After this deployment, a final 3-d heatwave treatment was applied to both the FS 3 and IL 6 ""heatwave"" pots, but not to the no-heatwave ""control"" and ""blank"" pots (Fig. 1b). When the experiment ended, the PVC pots with luminophores were horizontally sliced using a metal spade along depth gradients (i.e., every 0.5 cm till 3.0 cm, then 1.0 cm per slice till 5.0 cm).

These images were processed using a custom script of ImageJ2 and R 4.0.0 software. First, the images were subdivided into RGB stacks, and the brightness threshold of red 128-255 was used to distinguish the image pixels in red luminophores and sediment. Then, the total number of luminophore pixels in each slice was counted (S bioturb-depth , cm 2 ). Only pixels within the circular region in the center frame of the photo (within the PVC tube) were analyzed. A buffer margin of 5 mm from the edge within the tube was also excluded to minimize edge effects due to the cutting process.Since luminophores were applied on top of the sediment, the luminophore counts in photographs taken from the top view of below-ground sediment slices provide a quantitative indicator of the bioturbation activity in an individual PVC core. Due to limitations of the slicing tool, in all cores, the first two sediment slices taken at a depth of 0.5 cm and 1 cm were disturbed by edge effects and thus neglected. As < 1% luminophore pixels were observed in slices taken below 3 cm (i.e., at 4 and 5 cm depth), these slices were also neglected.

We used luminophore tests to get quantitative proxies for bioturbation activities.

## Cockles' response to thermal stress: Mortality and behavior
Repeated exposure to heatwaves (defined as temperatures ≥ 35 C) can lead to the death of cockles. The 3-d cycle heatwaves (FS 3 ) resulted in a 72.73% survival rate (see Supporting Information Appendix S3, Fig. SA2). Even though the total number of heating days was the same, the 6-d cycle heatwaves (IL 6 ) resulted in a lower survival rate at 47.37% (Fig. SA2). The same applies when comparing the survival rate of IL 6 to the survival rate in the absence of any thermal stress (no-heatwave controls, 100% survival). The method of behavioral measurement can detect significant differences in the burrowing depth under different heatwave settings (significance levels are shown in Fig. 2). The burrowing behavior of cockles was affected by thermal stress (Fig. 2). During low tide, the cockles burrowed deeper into the sediment when exposed to heatwave conditions (Fig. 2b). Upon the return of the high tide, the cockles then moved toward the surface. On ambient temperature days between heatwaves, the behavior of cockles that had earlier experienced heatwaves returned to movement patterns similar to those seen in cockles in the permanently ambient temperature treatments (Fig. 2a).",False,False,False,

Cockles' activities always introduced the surface particles into up to 3 cm sediment layers, resulting in similar overarching patterns as shown in Fig. 3.

This trend was consistent from 1.0 to 2.5 cm depth (Fig. 3). The statistical results for Fig. 3 are shown in Tables S4, S5 in Supporting Information Appendix S5.The heatwave duration significantly impacted the amount of biodisturbed sediments (Table 4, ANCOVA, F = 12.01, df treatments = 2, p < 0.01).

Studying bioturbation under heatwaves is essential to understand the effects of global warming on the tidal flat sedimentary environment, as bioturbation is known to affect both the sediment mixing and the erodibility of tidal flats. In the present study, we show for the first time that bioturbation effects under global warming strongly depend on the frequency and duration of the heatwaves. That is, repeated short heatwaves can increase bioturbation activity while not causing much mortality. In contrast, the less frequent long-duration heatwaves decrease the overall bioturbation activity as it increases bioturbators' mortality, thereby causing less sediment mixing. Predicting climate-change effects on tidal flat functioning requires insights into the frequency and duration of future heatwaves and in-depth studies on the behavioral responses and mortality consequences of key bioturbating species, as demonstrated in the current study.",False,False,False,
510,10.1002/lno.12332,19,True,"## Thermal tolerance of organisms in the face of climate change
In our experiment, cockles that suffered from 3-d repetitions of heating treatments showed more vertical movement than those under ambient temperatures. This response can be seen as a strategy in which bioturbators adjust their burial depth and use the sediment as a thermal refuge during the heatwave (Payette and McGaw 2003;Munguia et al. 2017). Other bivalve species also adapt their burial depth to elevated temperatures. For example, a mesocosm experiment showed that Ruditapes decussatus burrowed deeper into the sediment under simulated heat stress of 29 C to 8 cm depth (Domínguez et al. 2021). Compared with C. edule, R. decussatus typically buries deeper into the sediment, potentially down to 20 cm (Macho et al. 2016). Therefore, we summarize the response strategies by which benthic organisms cope with extreme temperatures with the following two strategies: (1) either employing more horizontal movements to search for locations with less stressful temperature conditions; or (2) burrowing deeper to use deep layers of the sediment as a shelter to escape the extreme heat stress. The trade-offs between these two strategies will likely depend on a species' physiological limitations and energy consumption. For example, the maximal burrowing depth of bioturbating bivalves is mainly limited by their siphon size (i.e., physiological limitation) (Zwarts and Wanink 1989). However, higher filtration costs due to enhanced movements will typically increase the energy consumption of these bivalves (Sobral and Widdows 2000). When the heatwave duration does not pass the critical point of bioturbators' thermal tolerance thresholds, the bioturbation can be enhanced due to more movements (status ""a"" to ""b""). After the heatwaves, bioturbators' condition may still recover (as indicated by the blue arrow on ""b""). When the heatwave duration lasts too long, bioturbators' health conditions are reduced, leading to reduced bioturbation effects (status ""a"" to ""c""). In the worst case, the bioturbator may no longer be able to recover (as indicated by the blue arrow on ""c""), resulting in mass mortality (status ""d"").",False,False,False,
511,10.1002/lno.12332,20,True,"These strategies can be regarded as regulatory behaviors that are stimulated by the environmental conditions of microhabitats. Microhabitats are usually local habitats with less harsh environmental conditions than those at larger spatial scales. Many intertidal ectotherms have developed a range of behavioral strategies to search for suitable microhabitats and adapt to temperature variations (Williams 1984;Muñoz et al. 2005). In cooler environments, most freshwater insect larvae avoid freezing by actively staying in the water body that will not freeze; lizards will shuttle between the sun and shade to maintain their body temperature in an optimal range (Lencioni 2004;Diaz and Cabezas-Diaz 2004). In a warmer environment, snails may actively search for sheltered microhabitats on rocky shores to escape direct sunlight and stabilize their body temperatures during daytime emersion; capitellids may burrow deeper to escape warm temperatures that exist in natural soft sediments (Tsubokura et al. 1997;Lardies et al. 2001). The movement behaviors demonstrated by cockles in our experiments could be considered an example of the wide range of thermoregulatory movement responses commonly practiced by ectotherms.",False,False,False,
512,10.1002/lno.12332,21,True,"Tidal flat invertebrates may cope temporarily with thermal stress through thermoregulatory behaviors such as burrowing. However, when the thermal stress (e.g., magnitude, duration, etc.) surpasses critical thresholds, these response strategies may fail and lead to severe physiological stress or even mass mortality (Fig. 4b). The findings by Deldicq et al. (2021) also support the conceptual summary shown in Fig. 4b, in that foraminifera reduced their activity by up to 80% under hightemperature regimes (i.e., 36 C) and the photosynthetic activity of their sequestered chloroplasts significantly decreased. When the heatwave duration is long enough to create mass mortality (50% death rate in this experiment), organisms cannot escape from the continuous accumulation of heat stress via different behavioral strategies. The resulting mass mortality can potentially cause large-scale species distribution shifts (Fiori and Cazzaniga 1999;Wernberg et al. 2013;Pairaud et al. 2014). Due to the mass mortality of adult individuals, the age structure of native species tends to be younger in the following year (Magalhães et al. 2016;Beukema and Dekker 2020). This implies that if the duration of heatwaves strongly increases under climate-change scenarios, there will not be enough adults to produce larvae. As a result, native species with poor temperature tolerance will not persist, thereby giving up their niche to more heat-tolerant invasive species (Molnar et al. 2008). Both native species depletion and invasive species replacement can result in functioning shifts of the whole tidal flat ecosystems.",False,False,False,
513,10.1002/lno.12332,22,True,"## Implications for bioturbation in tidal flat ecosystems
Our experiment provides novel insights into the effects of heatwaves on tidal flats by demonstrating that the temporal scale of heatwaves is a key factor in driving the overall bioturbation outcome (Fig. 4b). High temperature promotes bioturbation rates via increased metabolism (Ouellette et al. 2004;Pörtner and Farrell 2008;Cozzoli et al. 2019). In this experiment, repeated short-duration heatwaves increased cockles' burrowing activities, as shown in their daily burrowing depth change. Studies have shown that bioturbation activities result in higher erodibility dependent on sediment type and suspended particle content (Willows et al. 1998;Li et al. 2017). Thus, more erosion can be expected under short-duration heatwaves. Moreover, bioturbating activities promote sediment mixing and chemical resource exchange (Mermillod-Blondin and Rosenberg 2006; Sturdivant and Shimizu 2017). To our surprise, the luminophore tests yielded a similar bioturbation effect between the control and FS 3 heatwaves. This similarity might be due to the relatively long 3-d action duration before slicing and the limited volume of the PVC pots. Cockles living in the small PVC pots thus had sufficient time to disturb most of the sediments. Nevertheless, previous studies indicated that enhanced burrowing activities under short-duration heatwaves potentially resulted in a deeper oxygen penetration (Weissberger et al. 2009;Sturdivant et al. 2012), which will further change the bottom chemical conditions for microbial communities and other organisms (Jørgensen and Des Marais 1990).",False,False,False,
514,10.1002/lno.12332,23,True,"However, temperature regimes beyond physiological thresholds can impede bioturbators' activities to reduce the animals' energy consumption (Pörtner 2001;Wu et al. 2017;da Silva Vianna et al. 2020). For example, the mudflat foraminifera Haynesina germanica can contribute most to sediment reworking under moderate temperatures between 6 C and 30 C, yet significantly reduce activities by 75% under extremely high temperatures (i.e., 32-36 C, Deldicq et al. 2021). The opportunistic deposit-feeding polychaete Capitella sp. burrowed significantly deeper at 21 C than at 15 C; however, they suffer from mortality at 32 C (Przeslawski et al. 2009). Similar responses were observed in our experiment: the biodisturbed area under the IL 6 heatwave was significantly lower than the ambient control temperature, though cockles' burrowing depth varied during the heatwaves.",False,False,False,
515,10.1002/lno.12332,24,True,"Heatwaves are usually fragmented by mild temperature periods, during which the organisms may recover from the thermal stress (Woodin et al. 2013;Pansch et al. 2018). The tolerance landscape theory by Rezende et al. (2014) states that species-specific tolerance thresholds are determined by the stress event's intensity and duration. In addition, our study revealed the importance of the heatwave temporal dynamics in determining bioturbators' thermal tolerance thresholds. Present findings are conceptualized in a generic schematization as Fig. 4b. Although our experiment settings indicate significant effects of heatwave duration and frequency in soft sediments, the current conceptualizations can be enlarged to other species and broader habitats. For example, the study by Seuront et al. (2019) showed that the mussel M. edulis living on rocky shores suffered a 100% mortality when exposed only once to 41 C for 6 h, while they also suffered a 100% mortality when exposed five times to 32 C for 6 h. Moreover, another rocky-shore species Littorina littorea also showed a similar response pattern to heatwaves that the temperature at which its heat coma occurred declined significantly with repeated daily exposures (Clarke et al. 2000). These results together indicate that the temporal dynamics of the heatwaves are one of the determining factors for the species sustainability in tidal flat ecosystems, especially under the current global change scenarios featured by increasing frequency and duration of heatwaves.The present novel findings show that it is the combination of heatwave frequency and duration that determines the outcome of ecosystem functioning like bioturbation. We thus call for action to gain a broader knowledge based on how key bioturbating species respond to the interaction between heatwave frequency and duration, and its meaning for multiple other key species inhabiting tidal flats. This is the only way toward quantifying in detail the conceptualized relationship (Fig. 4b) at the community level.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Choline and glycine betaine (GBT) are utilized as osmolytes to counteract osmotic stress, but also constitute important nutrient sources for many marine microbes. Bacterial catabolism of these substrates can then lead to the production of climate active trace gases such as methylamine and methane. Using radiotracers, we investigated prokaryotic choline/GBT uptake and determined biotic and abiotic factors driving these processes in the Western English Channel, UK. Kinetic uptake parameters indicated high affinity (nM range) for both osmolytes and showed a seasonal pattern for choline uptake. Generalized linear modeling of uptake parameters suggested a significant influence of sea surface temperature and salinity on prokaryotic uptake of both osmolytes. The presence of diatoms significantly influenced prokaryotic choline/GBT uptake dynamics. Choline uptake was further related to the occurrence of Phaeocystis spp., which were highly abundant in the phytoplankton community during spring, and dinoflagellates abundance during summer. While Rhodobacteraceae were the most important bacterial drivers for prokaryotic choline uptake, prokaryotic GBT uptake was associated with various groups such as SAR11 (Pelagibacterales) and Gammaproteobacteria, suggesting a wider capacity for GBT catabolism than previously recognized. Furthermore, using a newly developed approach we determined the first available data for dissolved GBT concentrations in seawater and found both osmolytes to be at the sub-nanomolar range. Together, this study improves our understanding of the biogeochemical cycling of these environmentally important osmolytes and highlights how their cycles may be affected by a changing climate.",False,False,False,

Marine organisms accumulate organic solutes (osmolytes) within their cells in order to maintain favorable osmotic pressure (Yancey 2005). These include, but are not limited to, glycine betaine (GBT), choline, and dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Noteworthy, the cation choline potently alleviates osmotic stress in some bacteria (Csonka and Hanson 1991 and references within), but also acts as a precursor to the zwitterionic GBT. Choline can be oxidized to GBT which accumulates inside cells (Abee et al. 1990;Kiene 1998). As environmental conditions change, for example, fluctuations in osmolarity or changes in sea surface temperature, osmolytes are then released into the environment and serve as important sources of nutrients for marine microorganisms. Microbial metabolism of the sulfur-containing DMSP has received much attention over the past few decades because it is the precursor of the climate-active gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS) (Charlson et al. 1987;Quinn and Bates 2011). However, there is an increasing body of evidence suggesting that the degradation of nitrogen-containing osmolytes (N-osmolytes) may also contribute to the release of climate-active gases, for example, methylated amines which are important for aerosol nucleation in the marine atmosphere (Almeida et al. 2013;Schobesberger et al. 2013). Furthermore, it is known that Nosmolytes can be readily utilized by the marine microbial community to produce the greenhouse gas methane (Welsh 2000;Jameson et al. 2019;Jones et al. 2019).Methanogenic Archaea capable of methanogenesis directly from GBT and choline have also been recently isolated (reviewed by Kurth et al. 2020). Hence, there is a pressing need to better understand the GBT and choline cycle in marine waters.",False,False,False,
532,10.1002/lno.12056,2,True,"Unfortunately, microbial uptake and catabolism of nitrogen-containing osmolytes (e.g., GBT, choline) in oxygenated waters is poorly understood (King 1988;Mausz and Chen 2019). This is somewhat surprising given that not only are N-osmolytes ubiquitous in marine organisms, but also their standing concentrations in surface marine waters and in phytoplankton particles are comparable to, if not greater than, that of DMSP and DMS (Keller et al. 2004;Airs and Archer 2010;Beale and Airs 2016). Despite their abundance, while detectable in phytoplankton particles (Airs and Archer 2010;Beale and Airs 2016), no reliable method exists to directly measure in situ GBT and choline concentrations in seawater. So far, only an enzymatic assay exploiting the fact that choline can be oxidized via choline oxidase to produce H 2 O 2 provides an indirect means to detect choline and puts its concentration in the 0-45 nM range for coastal seawater (Roulier et al. 1990).",False,False,False,

We and others have shown that cosmopolitan marine heterotrophic bacteria can grow on choline/GBT as sole carbon and nitrogen sources (Sun et al. 2011;Lidbury et al. 2015), thereby enabling them to better adapt to oligotrophic marine surface waters. Recent estimates using cultures of SAR11 bacteria have shown that SAR11 clade isolates have high-affinity membrane transporters with an affinity for GBT of approximately 1 nM (Noell and Giovannoni 2019). This agrees with early radiotracer experiments using 14 C-GBT, showing that once released, GBT is turned over rapidly (a few hours) in coastal seawater, indicating that free-living marine bacteria in surface waters serve as a major sink for GBT (Kiene et al. 1998).In this study, we set out to determine the uptake of choline and GBT by coastal marine microbes, particularly the freeliving fraction among prokaryotes, using 14 C-radioisotopes in order to better understand the seasonality and key environmental drivers for N-osmolyte uptake. Using amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes, flow-cytometry and microscopy, we determined the key microbial and phytoplankton groups that are strongly associated with choline and GBT dynamics in surface coastal waters.

## Sample collection
Seawater samples used for this study were sampled between April 2015 and April 2017 at the long-term monitoring Station L4 (50 15.00 0 N, 4 13.02 0 W) of the Western Channel Observatory (https://www.westernchannelobservatory.org.uk).

For both uptake experiments and community analysis, two aliquots of 10 L seawater were immediately transferred into acid-rinsed 10 L carboys (polypropylene, Nalgene).

## Choline and GBT uptake kinetics and seasonality
We performed a 2-yr seasonal study (April 2015-April 2017) of prokaryotic uptake of choline and GBT from Station L4 of the Western Channel Observatory, UK. We observed Michaelis-Menten-like uptake kinetics for both substrates, suggesting that these transporters likely possess a singlesubstrate binding site (reviewed by Diallinas 2014) (Fig. 1b,c). Wright and Hobbie transformation (Wright and Hobbie 1966) allowed determination of kinetic parameters of prokaryotic uptake (Fig. 1d,e), K t + S n , with K t representing the transport constant and S n representing the natural substrate concentration in seawater, and V max representing the maximum uptake velocity. K t + S n values for choline ranged between 1.9 and 5.3 nM with lowest values observed in August and October 2015 and during the spring bloom in 2016 (Fig. 2a). V max (the ""uptake rate"") ranged between 0.2 and 3.4 nM h À1 with the largest value coinciding with the shortest turnover time (t turnover ) for S n of 0.54 AE 0.14 h determined for August 2015 (Fig. 2b,c). These values are similar to choline kinetic parameters reported from coastal waters of Mobile Bay (Kiene 1998).

Salinity ranged from 34.78 to 35.31 PSU and was mostly high on sampling dates in 2015, while in 2016 values were low in winter and spring increasing toward summer and autumn. Sea surface temperature (SST) followed a seasonal trend being lowest in the winter and first spring sample (< 10 C) and reaching its maximum of ~16 C in the August summer samples (Supporting Information Table S2).

Environmental factors significantly affected prokaryote communities both at the family or RSV level on dates sampled for choline (p-value: 0.0065, and 0.0105, respectively) and GBT uptake (p-values: 0.0001) (Supporting Information Table S7), suggesting that uptake of choline/GBT is strongly influenced by bacterial abundance.Environmental factors explained ~57% of the variability of functional groups of the phytoplankton and microzooplankton community, but only ~35% of the variability of plankton species by the first two axes constituting a SST gradient and a nutrient gradient (Supporting Information Fig. S6). For prokaryotes at the family level (Supporting Information Fig. S7a,c), nutrients, salinity, and Chl a (as a proxy for biomass) structured the first axis, while the second axis was best described by a SST gradient. SST exerted strong effects on prokaryote families irrespective of the N-osmolyte sampled: Rhodobacteraceae, Haliaceae, and Cyanophyceae correlated positively and SAR11 Clades I and II, Cryomorphaceae, and uncultured Marinimicrobia negatively (Supporting Information Tables S8, S9). This complements previous reports (Gilbert et al. 2012;Sargeant et al. 2016) which showed that Rhodobacterales dominated surface waters of Station L4 during warmer water conditions, while SAR11 was highly abundant in winter. Interestingly, the nutrient gradient of the first axis seemed to also separate sampling dates: samples taken in late spring and summer correlated with salinity, POC, PON, and Chl a, while autumn, winter, and early spring samples aligned with N and PO 3À 4 (Supporting Information Fig. S7). The db-RDAs suggest that SST, salinity, and a combination of N and PO 3À 4 together strongly influenced both plankton and prokaryote community structure, which also affected choline and GBT uptake kinetics by the Station L4 microbial community.",False,True,False,

This supported our selection of short incubations (10-20 min) for determining uptake kinetics. Interestingly, we observed seasonal variations in the percentage of labeled substrates taken up by the prokaryote community, with lower uptake in the autumn and winter. GBT was generally taken up faster compared to choline (Supporting Information Table S10). Only about 20% of choline/GBT was oxidized to 14 CO 2 in 24 h in spring samples in 2016, suggesting that these compounds may be taken up primarily for osmolyte function (Supporting Information Table S10).

To verify our approach, we performed uptake kinetics of samples spiked with a known concentration of choline/ GBT and carried out threefold dilution experiments at three  1.sampling dates (Supporting Information Table S11). In general, calculated S n values largely agreed with substrate concentrations that were spiked into those samples.

554,10.1002/lno.12056,24,True,"## Discussion
In this study, we carried out the first seasonal measurements of choline/GBT uptake kinetics in coastal seawater. Our data showed that bacteria possessed high-affinity uptake systems (low nM) for these N-osmolytes throughout the 2-yr study period (2015)(2016)(2017), with kinetic parameters (K t + S n , V max , t turnover ) largely in agreement with the few uptake values available from previous studies in temperate waters (Kiene 1998;Kiene and Hoffmann Williams 1998). Previous choline uptake affinity values from estuarine waters in Mobile Bay (Gulf of Mexico) were 2.9 and 1.7 nM for samples taken in December 1996 and September 1997, respectively (Kiene 1998). Similarly, estuarine and shelf waters off the US east coast had GBT affinity values ranging between 1.2 to 49 nM (Kiene and Hoffmann Williams 1998). These earlier data as well as the measurements we present here suggest that low standing concentrations of these osmolytes in surface seawater necessitate high-affinity transport for uptake and subsequent catabolism of these substrates. Indeed, the half saturation constant for the SAR11 GBT transporter is ~1 nM (Noell and Giovannoni 2019).",False,False,False,
555,10.1002/lno.12056,25,True,"Our radiotracer uptake approach, besides providing uptake kinetics, also allowed an approximation of the in situ standing concentration of these solutes, that is, S n , albeit values cannot be separated from the value of the transport constant, K t (i.e., values are K t + S n ). Nevertheless, uptake kinetic data derived from bacterial communities have previously been used to estimate the boundaries of choline concentrations (from the K t + S n value) in Arctic sea-ice brines to be 50-100 nM (Firth et al. 2016), values far above the sub-nanomolar concentrations reported here. This large difference is potentially related to release from sea-ice diatoms, which have high intracellular choline and GBT concentrations (Torstensson et al. 2019), following strong temperature-driven osmolarity fluctuations in the brines (Firth et al. 2016). Our data showed high prokaryotic uptake with rapid turnover resulting in low S n irrespective of release rates from phytoplankton at an osmolarity much lower than in sea-ice brines. In contrast to those boundary estimates by Firth et al. (2016), actually measuring S n for choline/GBT is a challenge for oceanographers and the only reported concentrations for choline in coastal seawater (0-45 nM) were quantified from an indirect measurement of hydrogen peroxide formation from choline oxidation (Roulier et al. 1990). Hence, the approach we developed using dilution bioassays to directly determine S n according to Wright and Hobbie (1966) and validated by spiking with substrate of known concentration should constitute a direct approach with theoretically more accurate results for S n . The high error in the present data set though, indicates that further methodological improvement is warranted. However, this approach has the potential to provide a useful and sensitive tool for quantifying sub-nanomolar concentrations of solutes in natural seawater. The data we report here represent the first known data set for in situ concentrations of dissolved GBT in seawater.",False,False,False,
556,10.1002/lno.12056,26,True,"GLMs showed a significant influence of several environmental factors on prokaryotic uptake of these osmolytes, particularly SST and salinity. The influence of salinity is perhaps not surprising, since it induces osmotic stress and GBT is a well-known compatible solute for marine organisms (Yancey et al. 1982). Previous radiotracer studies already showed that increasing salinity resulted in accumulation of intracellular choline/GBT and favored the conversion of choline to GBT, which was subsequently retained by cells as an osmolyte (Kiene 1998;Kiene and Hoffmann Williams 1998;Firth et al. 2016), while a salinity decrease facilitated respiration of choline to 14 CO 2 (Firth et al. 2016). It is also known that the optimum temperature for GBT uptake is near to the in situ temperature (Kiene and Hoffmann Williams 1998), supporting our finding that SST significantly influenced microbial choline and GBT uptake at Station L4. In addition, the nutrients nitrogen (in the forms of nitrite, nitrate and ammonium) as well as PO 3À 4 significantly influenced prokaryotic uptake of GBT based on our GLM analysis, although apparently with opposite effects (positive for N, negative for PO 3À 4 ). Indeed, it is well known that GBT can be utilized as a carbon and nitrogen source by marine bacteria (Welsh 2000), which includes widely distributed bacterial taxa such as Rhodobacterales and Pelagibacterales that are abundant at Station L4 (Sun et al. 2011;Gilbert et al. 2012;Lidbury et al. 2015;Sargeant et al. 2016). Accordingly, our db-RDA showed that SST and macronutrients (N, PO 3À 4 ) were the main drivers for community composition and hence also determined microbial choline and GBT uptake kinetics. Overall, our data support the hypothesis of Kiene and co-workers (Kiene et al. 1998), that the extent osmolytes are retained or catabolized depends on the level of stress either in the form of salinity, nutrient availability, or temperature that a microorganism is exposed to.",False,False,False,
557,10.1002/lno.12056,27,True,"The significant correlation of several phytoplankton and microzooplankton groups with microbial uptake of choline and GBT, as found by our multivariate analysis, may seem obvious considering that many marine organisms accumulate and actively produce choline/GBT for osmoprotection (Yancey 2005;Kageyama et al. 2018). Nevertheless, current knowledge of N-osmolyte production in plankton groups is limited and lies beyond the perspective of this study. Only a few cultivated groups have ever been tested for their particulate GBT concentration (Keller et al. 1999;Spielmeyer et al. 2011) and reports for choline are limited to sea-ice diatoms (Torstensson et al. 2019). Both choline and GBT have been found at low fmol cell À1 concentrations in sea-ice diatoms (Torstensson et al. 2019) and intracellular GBT has been reported from a couple of diatom cultures (Spielmeyer et al. 2011), supporting the affiliation of diatoms to prokaryotic uptake of N-osmolytes. However, in the few available studies intracellular osmolyte concentrations depend on culture growth phase (Keller et al. 1999) and are influenced by culture conditions, increasing with higher temperature while decreasing at elevated carbon dioxide (Spielmeyer and Pohnert 2012). This could hence explain the differences between reported concentrations and associations observed here. It can further be expected that the phytoplankton and microzooplankton intracellular choline/GBT pool is not immediately available for microbial uptake, because of a delayed release from cells to the DOM pool depending on, for example, cell degradation, sloppy feeding, or viral lysis. Thus, an alternative explanation for the observed correlation pattern might lie in a recent study suggesting that cross-feeding of ammonium between Rhodobacteraceae bacteria and their associated diatoms constitutes a widespread metabolic interaction (Zecher et al. 2020) explaining their co-occurrence. To support this hypothesis, further research would be required, though.",False,False,False,
558,10.1002/lno.12056,28,True,"Analysis of correlations between prokaryote community dynamics and choline/GBT uptake offers interesting insights into the cycling of these osmolytes. Choline uptake seemed to be solely driven by the presence of Rhodobacteraceae, which dominate the bacterial community at Station L4 during the spring and summer months (Gilbert et al. 2012;Sargeant et al. 2016). Accordingly, we also observed seasonality in choline uptake parameters (V max , t turnover ), which were most explicit between spring/summer and autumn samples. Thus, choline uptake might be structured by seasonal dynamics of those bacteria catabolizing choline, a trait prevalent in marine Roseobacter clade bacteria (Lidbury et al. 2015). While Roseobacter genera are also known to degrade GBT (Lidbury et al. 2015), prokaryotic GBT uptake correlated with other groups instead, among them Gammaproteobacteria and SAR11 (Pelagibacterales) clade I. Pelagibacterales oxidize GBT to CO 2 (Sun et al. 2011). In addition, GBT can be catabolized via GBT demethylation by a GBT demethylase (GbcAB) (Wargo et al. 2008). The presence of multiple bacterial catabolic pathways might explain the observed correlation between several members of the prokaryote community and GBT uptake. If multiple taxa are able to take up and catabolize GBT, this might have implications for seasonality. With different GBT consumer populations present in different seasons, prokaryotic GBT uptake would be less prone to seasonal patterns. Indeed, we found no seasonal pattern of GBT uptake parameters K t + S n and V max . Accordingly, while Pelagibacterales apparently dominate at Sta. L4 during the winter, the abundance of Gammaproteobacteria, which showed multiple correlations with prokaryotic GBT uptake, varied throughout the year, independent of temperature and day length (see also Gilbert et al. 2012). Our data thus indicate the existence of yet more overlooked key players in marine GBT uptake and degradation such as the Gammaproteobacteria.",False,False,False,

Rhodobacteraceae are known for their interaction with phytoplankton, especially diatoms (Zecher et al. 2020). Similarly, prokaryotic GBT uptake was influenced mainly by SST, salinity, and macronutrients (nitrogen, PO 3À  4 ). Critically, our data suggest that prokaryotic choline/GBT uptake provides an effective alternative nutrient source for prokaryotes in marine systems and the ability for choline/GBT uptake by marine microbes might be more widespread than previously thought. Given that we are at a tipping point in the climate change crisis (e.g., sea surface warming, expansion of gyres and nutrient depletion in surface waters), more research into the fate of choline/GBT is required, especially since their degradation leads to the formation of climate active trace gases such as methylamine and methane.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
In this study, we show that the deep-sea meiofauna community at the Brazilian Equatorial Margin (BEM) is strongly influenced by the Amazon River. Our comparison across four deep ocean basins including Amazon, Par a-Maranhão, Barreirinhas, and Cear a showed that the former supports a completely distinct meiofaunal community. Meiofaunal richness increased with increasing distance from the Amazon, reflecting changes in sediment proprieties among basins. Total phytopigment content at Amazon sediments was threefold higher than at other basins. The chlorophyll a/Phaeo mean ratio, however, was lower than 1, suggesting a predominant degraded bulk organic matter derived from the Amazon River discharge. Nematode assemblages from Amazon strongly differed from the other basins mostly due to higher genus richness, trophic diversity, and variations in the abundance of Sabatieria, which in turn led into higher dissimilarity values and turnover rate. Furthermore, the bathymetric distribution of nematode assemblages at Amazon and Cear a basins differed significantly among depth zones, especially due to the higher abundance and diversity at Amazon basin. Our findings show that the Amazon River plays a critical role in structuring and shaping the deep-sea meiofauna and nematode biodiversity at the BEM. Increasing impacts on the Amazon rainforest will certainly affect the amount of freshwater discharge, and the quantity and quality of organic material transported to the Atlantic Ocean, which in turn will have effects on the deep-sea communities.",False,False,False,

The Amazon River (6300-7000 km in maximal length) and its watershed of 6.1 million km 2 comprise the most complex and largest network of river channels on Earth (Junk 2013). It flows from the Cordillera Rumi Cruz (Mantaro River) in Peru throughout northern Brazil, draining one-third of the South American continent (Coles et al. 2013;Contos and Tripcevich 2014). The Amazon River discharges on average 175,000 m 3 s À1 of freshwater ($6930 km 3 yr À1 ) into the adjacent Atlantic Ocean in northeastern Brazil. This represents 15-20% of the total global riverine discharge into the oceans, the equivalent to the freshwater input of the next eight largest rivers in the world combined (Coles et al. 2013;Medeiros et al. 2015). Large amounts of sediment, organic matter, and nutrients are also transported by the Amazon River (Aller et al. 1991;Goes et al. 2014;Medeiros et al. 2015), greatly contributing to the primary production along the northern region of the Brazilian Equatorial Margin (BEM). Although the effects of riverine plumes are largely felt on continental shelves, major rivers such as the Amazon can also influence the biogeochemistry and hydrography of larger areas including deep-sea habitats (Aller et al. 1991;Baguley et al. 2006;Goes et al. 2014;Medeiros et al. 2015).",False,False,False,

Conversely, this ecosystem is also the least explored with only $0.01% of its area investigated so far (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2010;Danovaro et al. 2014). Due to the lack of comprehensive studies, the deep sea was once considered to be a desertic and homogenous environment, with no seasonality (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2010). Our views, however, have drastically changed as our understanding of patterns and processes taking place in this ecosystem improved over the years. Currently, the deep sea is seen as a highly heterogeneous environment, with spatial variation occurring at various scales, which in turn influences the deep-sea biodiversity (Ramirez-Llodra et al. 2010;Sevastou et al. 2013;Danovaro et al. 2014). Furthermore, the deep sea is currently under serious threats due to climate change and other anthropogenic activities (e.g., exploration of gas, oil, mining, and fisheries) that can largely impact its biodiversity (Almada and Bernardino 2017;Danovaro et al. 2017;Niner et al. 2018).",False,False,False,

The meiofauna plays key ecological roles on benthic systems including the remineralization of nutrients in the sediment, thus stimulating microbial activity, and serving as a food source to higher trophic groups (Ingels et al. 2021). Moreover, these organisms, especially free-living nematodes, are highly diverse, abundant, and widely spread in the deep sea (Rosli et al. 2018), and therefore ideal candidates for testing well-established ecological hypotheses.Numerous studies have supported a negative relationship between ocean depth and meiofauna abundance and diversity (Soltwedel 2000;Sevastou et al. 2013;dos Santos et al. 2020), often related to the low productivity and flux of organic matter toward deeper ocean regions (Soltwedel 2000;Rosli et al. 2018;dos Santos et al. 2020). However, the unique discharge of freshwater by the Amazon River into the BEM may provide a substantial increase of food supply to deep-sea communities, and possibly supporting a higher meiofaunal abundance (Soltwedel 2000;Goes et al. 2014;Medeiros et al. 2015).",False,False,False,

Specifically, we compared the meiofauna across four deep ocean basins of the BEM: Amazon, Par a-Maranhão, Barreirinhas, and Cear a.

## Meiofauna distribution among deep ocean basins
At the BEM, the deep-sea meiofauna was composed of 12 major taxa, with densities ranging from 9 to 514 ind. 10 cm À2 . Nematodes numerically dominated meiofaunal communities at all four deep basins (Supporting Information Table S1), representing on average 71% of all the identified specimens (from 50% at Barreirinhas to $100% at Amazon), whereas copepods and polychaetes represented 19% and 6% of all the identified taxa, respectively. Copepods and polychaetes were more frequent at Barreirinhas (75% and 50%, respectively) and Par a-Maranhão (67% and 17%). Meiofaunal richness differed among BEM basins and was significantly lower at Amazon (Supporting Information Fig. S1 and Table S2). The highest meiofaunal richness was found at Cear a (farther away from the river mouth), although not significantly different from Barreirinhas and Par a-Maranhão. Meiofauna density, however, was almost four times higher at Amazon (mean of 197 ind. 10 cm À2 ) than at other basins (mean of ind. 10 cm À2 across all three basins, Supporting Information Fig. S1 and Table S2).",False,True,False,

Nematode genera Sabatieria (Comesomatidae) and Syringolaimus (Ironidae) occurred in all four deep basins, whereas 40% of all other genera were singletons (Supporting Information Table S1). Nematode genus dominance varied according to ocean basin. For example, Laimella (Comesomatidae) was most abundant at Cear a (19%), whereas Acantholaimus (Chromadoridae) dominated at both Par a-Maranhão and Barreirinhas (14% and 13%, respectively). Yet, Sabatieria was the dominant genus (17%) at Amazon basin (Table 2).All structural univariate descriptors of nematode assemblages including density, richness, H 0 , ES51, and J were significantly higher at Amazon basin (Fig. 2  S3, S4 for significant statistical differences).Information Table S2).

Consequently, the ITD reflected the differences in the proportions of nematode feeding types across deep basins, being significantly higher at Amazon basin.

The abundance of deposit feeder nematodes (both 1A and 1B) decreased with increasing depth at both basins (Fig. 5A). They represented around 70% of the nematodes at mid bathyal, 64% at lower bathyal, and 42% at upper bathyal.

More specifically, at the mid and lower bathyal zones, the ITD did not differ significantly between basins, while at the upper abyssal zone it was significantly higher at Amazon.

584,10.1002/lno.12197,20,True,"## Discussion
The massive input of terrigenous debris, organic material, and sediments and the highly transient fluid muds that are extensively reworked and remobilized along the Amazon continental shelf have led to a poor benthic community, and consequently to a bathymetric displacement of such communities from the inner shelf to offshore and deeper waters (e.g., Kempf 1970;Aller and Aller 1986;Aller and Stupakoff 1996). The present study shows that the deep-sea meiofauna at Amazon is characterized by a higher nematode richness, trophic diversity, and density than other ocean deep basins located farther southeast of the Amazon River mouth.Sedimentary variation resulting of a complex interplay between short-and long-term processes seems to play a key role in structuring the deep-sea meiofauna along the BEM. While the Amazon basin experienced an interruption of carbonate sedimentation during the Upper Miocene due to the contribution of siliciclastics from the Amazon, southwards the tectonic stability and low siliciclastic contribution allowed a continuous deposition of carbonates until the Recent (Silva et al. 1998). Indeed, the Amazon was characterized by muddy sediments with low carbonate content, whereas the other basins by sand muddy bottoms with high carbonate content (Supporting Information Fig. S2).At the Amazon basin, significantly higher OM, TOC, Al, and Fe indicate that these eroded materials were transported to the deep sea. The sediment carried by the Amazon River is also rich in reactive oxides (e.g., Fe, Mn, Al, and Si) that are incorporated into the ocean floor, thus affecting the biogeochemical processes (e.g., OM decomposition) as well as deep-sea benthic communities (Aller et al. 1991). In fact, the structure of the deep-sea meiofauna at Amazon basin was positively correlated with the high levels of Fe and Al, even when considering the effects of ocean depth (Fig. 6A,B).",False,False,True,
585,10.1002/lno.12197,21,True,"The Amazon has the largest discharge of any other river in the world, affecting the salinity and sea-level variations in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, especially during the rainy season (Giffard et al. 2019). The river plume may extend through the entire water column along the continental shelf and gradually attenuates with increasing depth, with a limited penetration (up to 50 m; Coles et al. 2013). Although salinity per se seem not to affect the deep-sea environment, the plume plays an important role in enhancing primary production far beyond the continental shelf, fueling the deep-sea biodiversity. The great differentiation of the Amazon from all other basins suggests that the Amazon discharge greatly influences the deep-sea meiofauna (see results section, Fig. 6A). To our knowledge, only a few studies, and all restricted to coastal sites or to the inner continental shelf (i.e., <100 m), have characterized the benthic communities of the BEM near the Amazon mouth (Kempf 1970;Aller and Aller 1986;Aller and Stupakoff 1996;Aller and Todorov 1997). These coastal studies revealed that the abundance, size distribution, functional diversity, and burrowing capacity of the benthic infauna are highly connected to the massive sediment deposition by the Amazon River and erosion of such terrigenous material along the continental shelf, which together creates a scenario of high physical disturbance (Aller and Stupakoff 1996;Aller and Todorov 1997).",False,False,False,
586,10.1002/lno.12197,22,True,"Our comparison among four deep basins at the BEM showed a significant increase in meiofaunal richness with increasing distance from the Amazon (i.e., highest at Cear a). The overall meiofaunal richness observed in this study (i.e., 12 groups) is similar to other studies on the deep sea (e.g., Schmidt et al. 2018;Sevastou et al. 2020). At the Amazon basin, however, differently from coastal (Christine et al. 2015;Venekey et al. 2019;Baia et al. 2021) and continental shelf (Aller and Aller 1986;Aller and Stupakoff 1996), the deep-sea meiofauna is almost entirely represented by nematodes. At the other basins (e.g., Cear a), increasing carbonate and sand percentages lead to a more heterogeneous benthic system, which in turn can support a higher meiofaunal richness (e.g., positively correlated with carbonate, Fig. 6A). Habitat heterogeneity can also increase food partitioning and therefore has been largely associated with higher meiofauna diversity (Netto et al. 2005;Levin et al. 2010;Rosli et al. 2016).For nematode assemblages, we observed an inverse pattern, with higher abundance and diversity, including trophic diversity at Amazon basin. Nematodes often flourish in fine sediments with higher OM content, which in this case are transported by the Amazon River to the adjacent shelf and deep sea. In the Gulf of Mexico, high nematode abundance and diversity, particularly in silt-dominated sediments and canyon areas, were also associated with the Mississippi River discharge (Baguley et al. 2006). River plumes are also known to increase the accumulation of phytodetritus and bacterial densities, positively affecting nematode biodiversity at coastal waters (Danovaro et al. 2000) and deep-sea habitats (Dessandier et al. 2016).",False,False,False,

Carbon of fresh and degraded algal origin is typically associated with the organic matter fraction enzymatically digestible by consumers, and often supports higher density and diversity of nematodes (Pusceddu et al. 2003;Dessandier et al. 2016).

Nematode studies along the Amazon continental shelf (Aller and Aller 1986;Aller and Stupakoff 1996) are limited to major taxa, although high abundance of the genus Theristus (Xyalidae) was pointed out by Aller and Aller (1986). Apart from the higher richness, which is associated with high nematode abundance and high resource availability, the assemblages at Amazon also exhibited higher dissimilarity values, thus indicating a higher turnover (Amazon: mean of 14%; other basins: mean of 34%). This pattern may reflect the high variability of the Amazon seasonal outflow (i.e., amount and quality of materials), likely increasing deep-sea heterogeneity and resource distribution, leading to patchiness of nematode assemblages (Ingels et al. 2009;Bianchelli et al. 2013).",False,True,False,

While Laimella is relatively uncommon at the deep sea (e.g., Chen and Vincx 2000;Rosli et al. 2018), Acantholaimus is a typical nematode of deep-sea habitats with a worldwide distribution (e.g., Muthumbi et al. 1997;Netto et al. 2005;Miljutin and Miljutina 2016). For the Amazon basin, Sabatieria was largely the dominant genus. This genus is considered one of the most common nematode taxa in shallow waters (Warwick and Gee 1984), shelf break, and upper slope (Netto et al. 2005), but normally absent or with reduced abundance in abyssal plains (Vanreusel et al. 2010).

590,10.1002/lno.12197,26,True,"The regional and bathymetric patterns observed in the present study, although highly significant, are a snapshot of an extremely dynamic region. The outflow of the Amazon River is known to have a high seasonal variability (Aller and Stupakoff 1996;Liang et al. 2020). Thus, future investigations evaluating the impact of the Amazon River on deep-sea communities should consider these seasonal changes. Our findings revealed a strong linkage between the Amazon River and the deep-sea meiofauna and nematode assemblages. Therefore, deep-sea benthic communities can be highly sensitive to changes in the composition and amount of terrigenous material discharged by the Amazon River. Deforestation and degradation of the Amazon Forest have result in decline of rainfall and atmospheric moisture transport (Bush et al. 2011). In addition, climate projections of a warmer Northern Tropical Atlantic Ocean and Equatorial Pacific foresee extreme droughts in the Amazon region, thus considerably reducing the outflow of the Amazon River (Jahfer et al. 2017). Therefore, this study brings awareness to the importance of the Amazon rainforest in controlling the flux of the Amazon River, which has a critical role in supporting biodiversity at the deep sea.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Fluctuations in the population abundances of interacting species are widespread. Such fluctuations could be a response to abiotic factors, biotic interactions, or a combination of the two. Correctly identifying the drivers is critical for effective population management. However, such effects are not always static in nature. Nonlinear relationships between abiotic factors and biotic interactions make it difficult to parse true effects. We used a type of nonlinear forecasting, empirical dynamic modeling, to investigate the context-dependent species interaction between a common fish (three-spine stickleback) and an endangered one (northern tidewater goby) in a fluctuating environment: a central California bar-built estuary. We found little evidence for competition, instead both species largely responded independently to abiotic conditions. Stickleback were negatively affected by sandbar breaching. The strongest predictor of tidewater goby abundance was stickleback abundance; however, this effect was not a uniform negative effect of stickleback on goby as would be hypothesized under interspecific competition. The effect of stickleback on gobies was positive, though it was temporally restricted. Tidewater goby abundance in the summer was strongly positively correlated to stickleback abundance in the spring, which represents an offset in the reproductive and recruitment peaks in the two species that may help minimize competition and promote coexistence. Our study demonstrates how empirical dynamic modeling can be applied to understand drivers of population abundance in putative competitors and inform management for endangered species.",False,False,False,

Both abiotic and biotic factors can drive population fluctuations (Grant et al. 2016;Šipoš et al. 2017;Morris et al. 2020). Understanding which drivers are acting on a given population is important for understanding resilience, estimating population viability, and managing endangered species (Sinclair and Byrom 2006;Traill et al. 2010). Abiotic factors such as climate and habitat degradation may limit population abundance or cause fluctuations in population size (Chavez et al. 2003;Lemoine et al. 2007;Kearney et al. 2010). Alternating population cycles of pairs of species may be taken as evidence for alternative responses to abiotic forcing variables such as climate (Chavez et al. 2003). Alternating cycles may be due to populations having different optimal values of fluctuating environmental variables, different seasonal patterns, or a combination thereof.Biotic interactions, such as competition, predation, or parasitism may also influence the abundance of a focal population (Bardsley and Beebee 2001;McGraw and Furedi 2005;Rogowski and Stockwell 2006). However, disentangling abiotic and biotic drivers, especially when those potential drivers fluctuate, can be challenging (Sugihara et al. 2012;Gabald on et al. 2019). Mirage correlations can occur when the relationship between predictor and population response is state dependent (Deyle et al. 2013). For example, determining whether abiotic conditions or biotic interactions are driving population fluctuations may be difficult if the presence of an interacting species depends on certain abiotic conditions (Rogowski and Stockwell 2006) or if interaction strength changes as a function of those abiotic conditions (Alcaraz et al. 2008;Jiao 2009;Deyle et al. 2016a).",False,False,False,
603,10.1002/lno.12042,2,True,"The magnitude of interaction strengths such as competition coefficients, and even the identity of the dominant competitor can change as a function of the environment (Stewart and Levin 1973;Dunson and Travis 1991;Muench and Elsey-Quirk 2019). Coexistence may depend on changes in the identity of the competitive dominant under fluctuations in environmental conditions (Hutchinson 1961). Typically, understanding such context-dependent species interactions requires conducting manipulative experiments under diverse environmental conditions which may be impractical when threatened and endangered species are concerned (Costanzo et al. 2005;Muench and Elsey-Quirk 2019).Empirical dynamic modeling, a type of nonlinear state space reconstruction, can be used to overcome these challenges using time series data (Sugihara et al. 2012). Such time series of abundance data is regularly collected for monitoring of some threatened and endangered species. Multivariate smap projection, a type of empirical dynamic modeling analysis, sequentially estimates the partial derivatives of the response variable with respect to each predictor variable over time. When response and predictors are the abundance of two species, these partial derivatives can be interpreted as a measure of time-varying interaction strength such as competition coefficients (Sugihara 1994;Deyle et al. 2016b). Such measures of interaction strength can be used to assess numerical population responses to competition. For the purposes of this study, competition is defined as a numerical response of one population's growth rate as a function of the other species' density.",False,False,False,
604,10.1002/lno.12042,3,True,"The habitat and abiotic conditions in bar-built estuaries in central California undergo dramatic seasonal fluctuations leading to episodic opening and closure (Williams and Stacey 2016). Bar-built estuaries, or lagoons, are intermittently connect to the ocean during the wet seasons but will dry up when the rains stop and the runoff runs out; then a sandbar or berm will form, disconnecting the estuary from the open ocean (Behrens et al. 2009(Behrens et al. , 2013;;Rich and Keller 2013). The bathymetry can change extensively during cycles of breaching and closing (Webb et al. 1991;Elwany et al. 1998;Orescanin and Scooler 2018). These physical changes to the shape of the estuary basin, from flowing and river-like during the winter to still and pond-like during the summer are accompanied by changes in the physicochemical properties of the estuary such as temperature, dissolved oxygen, and temperature and may include changes to stratification (Williams and Stacey 2016). Dissolved oxygen can reach anoxic conditions during the summer dry period.Northern tidewater goby (Eucyclogobius newberryi) are a federally threatened species that is a habitat specialist adapted to living in bar-built estuaries (Swenson 1999). Such specialization does not mean they are immune from mortality during extreme environmental conditions such as hypoxia or breaching (Williams and Stacey 2016;Swift et al. 2018). Tidewater goby populations fluctuate dramatically (Swenson 1999).Three-spine stickleback (TSS; Gasterosteus aculeatus) may function as competitors for tidewater gobies. In bar-built estuary habitats both species primarily consume benthic macroinvertebrates (Swenson and McCray 1996;S anchez-Gonz ales et al. 2001). In laboratory experiments stickleback presence negatively affected tidewater goby survival, but only when food resources were limiting (Chase et al. 2016;Chase and Todgham 2016). TSS are a common and widespread species, not restricted to bar-built estuary habitats (Bell and Foster 1994).",True,False,False,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **bar-built estuaries** (also referred to as **lagoons**).

*   **Dynamic bathymetry:** The shape of the estuary basin changes extensively with cycles of breaching and closing.

Second, we ask whether environmental conditions can cause changes in the interaction strength between stickleback and gobies. For example, the relationship between stickleback and goby abundance may depend on a third value, such as temperature, with competition stronger during warm weather, but weaker during cool weather.",False,False,False,

We surveyed fish in Younger Lagoon monthly from February 2014 through September 2020. Younger Lagoon is a 10-ha bar-built estuary, which is noteworthy in being unimpeded by habitat alteration such as channelization or anthropogenic breaching (Clark and O'Connor 2019). Younger Lagoon experiences annual breaching cycles as described above. In addition, during the dry, warm summer conditions, the lagoon is often densely populated by a primary producer. In many years, that is the submerged vegetation Ruppia, but other years a phytoplankton bloom occurs. Anoxic conditions may occur in the late summer as the producer biomass begins to senesce and decay, especially overnight.We placed 12 unbaited minnow traps (40.5 cm long, 22.9 cm diameter at the center, with 3 mm mesh, and openings with a diameter of 22 mm) along the eastern shore of the lagoon in the evening and retrieved them the next morning. Minnow traps were allowed to sink to the substrate. We did not place minnow traps in fixed locations. Instead, location was allowed to vary along the shoreline to prevent fish mortality since fluctuating water levels led to seasonal changes in habitat and anoxia risk. The front of the lagoon (the channel on the beach) was generally the deepest, the large central basin was less shallow, and the two upstream arms were the most shallow. When conditions warranted (warm temperatures and the potential for low oxygen), we varied the depth of water we set out traps in. As such we often moved them away from shore into deeper water. In the extreme, during hot summers and fall months, our traps in the central basin were placed along the thalweg (the deepest channel), and few if any traps were placed in the upstream arms because they were too shallow for the traps to even remain submerged. We counted the number of each species of fish encountered in each trap and report the average catch per unit effort for each survey.Starting in September 2014, we measured the surface water temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen (percent saturation) using a YSI Pro2030 at a subset of the trap locations, usually every other trap. We used linear interpolation to fill in missing data due to equipment failure (1 salinity measurement and 2 dissolved oxygen measurements).",False,False,False,

608,10.1002/lno.12042,7,True,"## Drivers of fish abundance
To understand which environmental drivers influence stickleback and goby abundances, we used empirical dynamic modeling, a set of tools for understanding nonlinear processes from time series data (Sugihara and May 1990;Sugihara 1994;Sugihara et al. 2012;Ye and Sugihara 2016). Empirical dynamic modeling uses time-lagged values of the measured variables to reconstruct the attractor of the underlying dynamic system based on generalized Taken's theorem (Sugihara and May 1990;Deyle and Sugihara 2011). We can then use this graphical model to make predictions and use measures of cross-validated prediction accuracy (rho, R 2 ) to compare alternative models (Deyle et al. 2013). For empirical dynamic modeling analysis we used a time series from September 2014 to September 2020. Our focal variables were the mean number of stickleback and tidewater goby caught per trap. Potential environmental drivers included the total amount of precipitation that had fallen (rain), the total number of days the lagoon was documented as open (breach) since the last survey, and the mean of temperature, dissolved oxygen, and salinity weighted by the number of traps associated with each measurement. We normalized all variables to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 to compare the relative importance of drivers measured on very different scales.",False,False,False,
609,10.1002/lno.12042,8,True,"We used convergent cross-mapping to identify which, if any, of the environmental variables, including the abundance of the other species, influence the abundance of the two focal species (Sugihara et al. 2012). In convergent cross-mapping, lags of the focal variable are used to make predictions about the state of a hypothesized driver (target variable) via simplex projection. If that target variable's states can be predicted by using lags of the focal variable then we say the focal variable cross-maps onto the target and that is evidence that the target variable exerts causal influence on the focal variable (Sugihara et al. 2012). We used this procedure to evaluate which target variables causally influence the abundance of each fish species. The embedding dimension (number of lags we used) for each species was the optimal embedding dimension for predicting the abundance of that species using a univariate simplex projection model (Sugihara and May 1990). To test whether the cross-mapping was significant, we compared the forecast accuracy for the target variable (cross-map skill, measured as rho, the Pearson correlation between predicted and observed values) from the model to cross-map skills derived from a null distribution (Deyle et al. 2016a). We created the null distribution of cross-map skills from 1000 surrogate time series by extracting a mean seasonal trend with a smoothing spline and then shuffling the residuals.If the abundance of a focal species (e.g., gobies) is driven primarily by abiotic factors, then we would expect it to only cross-map onto abiotic factors (e.g., temperature or dissolved oxygen). Alternatively, if competition is important in driving focal species abundance, then we would expect it to significantly cross-map onto the abundance of the other species (e.g., stickleback). If the focal species abundance significantly cross-maps to both abiotic factors and biotic factors then both are important for driving the abundance of the focal species and we can use s-map regression to determine whether those effects are merely additive, or whether they are interactive (i.e., context-dependent competition) (Deyle et al. 2016b).",False,False,False,
610,10.1002/lno.12042,9,True,"## Drivers of interaction strength
To test whether interaction strength between the two fish species varies with environmental conditions, we used another empirical dynamic modeling technique, s-map regression (Sugihara 1994). Multivariate s-map projection sequentially estimates the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives of the response variable with respect to each predictor variable over time and can be interpreted as a measure of time-varying interaction strength (May 1973; Deyle et al. 2016b). For each species we ran a number of multivariate s-map projections to predict species abundance at time t + 1. All models included two ""seasonal predictors"": s t and s tÀ3 , to account for seasonal variation (Rogers et al. 2020). The seasonal predictors were two sine functions (mean 0, variance 1) offset by 3 months, with a period of 1 yr and a timestep of 1 d, which used the sample date and the sample date from three samples earlier as input variables (e.g., if s t was the date of the April sample, then s tÀ3 was the date of the January sample). We then searched through a set of candidate models that included all possible combinations of those two seasonal predictors, lags of the two species abundance, and lags of any other predictors variables that the focal species was found to significantly cross-map to. We ran all possible combinations of lags for each predictor up to E, the univariate embedding dimension for the focal species (e.g., with two variables, we could have 2 + 3E predictors: 2 seasonal variables, and E lags of two variables + E lags of the species itself). S-map projection requires a nonlinear tuning parameter, θ, which indicates the

A value of θ = 0 represents an unweighted global model where all points contribute equally to predictions, whereas a larger value of θ means points nearby in predictor space are more heavily weighted.

We used an ANOVA to determine if either of the season variables or any of the environmental variables we measured were associated with the interaction strengths between the two species.

Stickleback and tidewater goby catch per unit effort fluctuated by three orders of magnitude (Fig. 1a,b), generally increasing in the spring and summer and crashing in the late summer, fall, or winter. No stickleback were encountered for 6 months from September 2018 through March 2019. It is not possible to distinguish whether the population persisted at low levels or whether it truly went extinct in fall of 2018 and was recolonized during the open phase of winter 2018-2019. In the spring of 2019, after several months with no stickleback captures, tadpoles of two species of amphibians, Pacific Chorus Frogs (Pseudacris regilla) and California Red-legged Frogs (Rana draytonii) were captured and swarming cladocerans (Daphnia magna) were observed in the shallows but were not observed at any other time during this survey.Rainfall varied seasonally as expected (Fig. 1f). Winters were characterized by rainfall that led to decreased salinity, and temperature, and eventually led to one or more breaching events (Fig. 1). Dry summer seasons were characterized by increased temperature, increased salinity as water evaporated from the isolated lagoon, and, in some cases, anoxia (Fig. 1c-f). Our fish surveys span most of the range of variation in annual rainfall at Younger Lagoon; they ranged from the 4 th wettest to the very driest years in the 25 years with sufficient data (Fig. S1a). In addition, drought monitor data reveal that of the 20 water years since 2001, our fish surveys ranged from the 1 st to the 16 th drouthiest years on record (Fig. S1b).",False,False,False,

The log-transformed total numbers of days the lagoon breached in a water year was more closely related to rainfall within a year than to Accumulated Drought Severity and Coverage Index which measures cumulative drought conditions (Table 1, Fig. S2).

The best model for predicting the abundance of stickleback at time t + 1 included the seasonal predictors and the current time points of stickleback (TSS t ), tidewater goby (TWG t ), and breach (Breach t ), but no time lags from further back. This model had an R 2 of 0.28, slightly better than the univariate stickleback model. The optimal value for θ, the nonlinear tuning parameter, in this model was 0.1 and this means that the model was weakly nonlinear, that is, interaction strengths did not change much as a function of ecosystem state. The mean magnitudes of the coefficient for the effect of tidewater goby abundance and breaching on stickleback abundance were similar and slightly negative; they were smaller than the coefficients for either seasonal predictor or stickleback abundance itself (Table 2).Even though seasonal variables were included as predictors in the s-map projections, the coefficient for the effect of gobies on stickleback was primarily associated with season, s t , (ANOVA, F 1,59 = 12.75, p = 0.001), and tidewater goby abundance (ANOVA, F 1,59 = 6.22, p < 0.016) (Table 3).

The best model for predicting the abundance of tidewater goby at time t + 1 included the seasonal predictors, the second and third lags of stickleback (TSS tÀ2 and TSS tÀ3 ), and the first lag of tidewater goby (TWG tÀ1 ). This model had an R 2 of 0.13, considerably better than the univariate model for tidewater goby.

618,10.1002/lno.12042,17,True,"## Discussion
Our results support the hypothesis that fluctuations in stickleback and endangered tidewater goby abundance reflect independent responses to environmental fluctuations rather than the effects of interspecific competition. Stickleback abundance was negatively affected by sandbar breaching. Tidewater goby abundance was affected by TSS abundance. However, when we used s-map regression to investigate the nature of that relationship, we found that the pattern was primarily driven by a large positive coefficient for the effect of stickleback abundance in the spring on tidewater goby abundance in the summer, rather than by fluctuations in the magnitude of negative interaction strengths that we would expect if statedependent competition was occurring.Although prior experiments have indicated the potential for competition (Chase et al. 2016 and the dynamics of population fluctuations in our study system seem to imply competition, our analyses revealed little evidence of competition. In our best model for explaining variation in goby abundance, positive effects of the third lag of stickleback (dTWG t /TSS tÀ3 ) outweighed the negative effect of the second lag of stickleback (dTWG t /dTSS tÀ2 ), and so the overall mean effect of stickleback on goby was positive (Table 2). Conversely, the mean effect of gobies on stickleback (dTSS t /dTWG t ) was negative, but had a very small magnitude, smaller than either seasonal effects or the effects of lagged stickleback abundance. Therefore, tidewater goby abundance did not have a major impact on stickleback abundance (also see Fig. 2). Taken at face value, this suggests a commensalism whereby stickleback have a positive effect on gobies, but we do not know of a plausible mechanism by which this would occur.",False,True,False,
619,10.1002/lno.12042,18,True,"Using s-map regression we investigated the temporal variation in interaction strength to better understand the relationship between the two species. Compared to the small effect of gobies on stickleback, stickleback were the primary driver of goby abundance in our models. For most of the year the magnitude of the effect was quite small. However, counter to our expectations, during the time periods when that effect was large, the effect was positive: in June and July, the lagged effect of stickleback on gobies was positive and very large (dTWG t /dTSS tÀ3 ) (Fig. 5). Therefore, for most of the year, there is not much meaningful effect of stickleback on gobies in either direction, but in these 2 months there is a distinct, but lagged, positive effect of stickleback. The lagged effect corresponds to a positive correlation between the abundance of stickleback in March and April with the abundance of gobies in June and July.

Such allochrony has been shown to help limit the potential for competition by offsetting peak resource use (Trivelpiece et al. 1987;Spilseth and Simenstad 2011;Clewlow et al. 2019). Another study of a bar-built estuary food web suggests a similar mechanism at play. Young et al. (2022) found stickleback and prickly sculpin to have a greater overlap in diet and stable isotope niche during the summer than the spring; tidewater goby were also similar during the summer but no goby data were available from the spring. Spatial segregation of resource use could also lead to a lack of negative impacts of the two species, but that does not explain the temporal pattern of positive interactions we detected.There was a great deal of spatial variation in conditions in Younger Lagoon, just as there was a great deal of temporal variation. We chose to focus on the temporal variation averaged over the spatial variation in this study. This allows us to focus on population-and system-wide data and processes. Our method of attractor reconstruction assumes that measured fish abundance acts as an observation function of the true state of abundance in the population; as long as catch (averaged over all 12 traps) is a monotonically increasing function of true abundance, our attractor reconstructions should give accurate results (Takens 1981). Still, it is possible that the two species might use the habitat differently during different periods of the year when those environmental conditions change (Moyle 2002). For example, we moved our traps around the lagoon to avoid locations where diel oxygen swings may cause fish mortality, but this may have changed the relative accessibility of our traps to stickleback and more anoxia-tolerant gobies (Swift et al. 2018). Unfortunately, this confounding effect could drive some of the relationships we see in the data. Further research could compare trapping studies to other methods, such as contemporaneous seine surveys or trap placement controls to further investigate this source of bias.",False,False,False,
622,10.1002/lno.12042,21,True,"An important direct effect of the environment we detected was a negative effect of breaching on stickleback abundance. Breaching appears to be a major mortality event for stickleback, with 90% or more reduction in abundance following the first breach in most years (Figs. 1a, 3). Goby abundance was not impacted by breaching in the same way (Fig. 1b). Although goby mortality in response to artificial, out-of-season breaches has been documented, our data reaffirm that natural breaching is not a major source of mortality for gobies and that they are well adapted to this feature of the environment (Swift et al. 2018). When we observed fish mortality following breaches, the majority of fish stranded on dewatered mud or sand flats were stickleback, and the few tidewater goby observed were alive, and many were on a section of mudflat that would likely rewater at the next high tide (B. A. Wasserman pers. obs.). All of our models did a better job of predicting stickleback abundance than they did tidewater goby abundance including univariate Simplex, bivariate convergent cross-mapping, and multivariate S-Map. Our analyses are robust to measurement error because time-delay embedding allows us to use data from multiple time points (Munch et al. 2020). However, measurement error or process error (stochasticity) may provide an upper limit on prediction accuracy in empirical dynamic modeling. It is therefore possible that tidewater goby abundance is marked by more stochasticity than stickleback abundance in this system. In addition, there may be other, rarer effects that we were unable to detect because they did not happen during our time series, or only happened on a single occasion. Empirical dynamic modeling generally require a time series that includes enough data to cover several times the characteristic return time for the system to resolve the attractor in that area of parameter space (Munch et al. 2020). For example, in 2018 we witnessed the largest abundances of both stickleback and gobies, followed by a population crash and an apparent wave overtopping event with unseasonable temperature and salinity measurements. The following spring tidewater goby abundances were higher than in other years. One might conclude this was due to lack of stickleback presence. While the Smap coefficients were slightly more negative in that year than others, our ANOVA did not identify any proximate driver of that difference, instead it only detected the overwhelming effect of season on the Smap coefficient of stickleback on gobies.",False,False,False,

However, they co-occur in a variety of environments and these results will be most applicable to similar ecosystems. Small bar-built estuaries draining intermittent streams in central California share a number of features that may influence this interaction. In such small sites that are rarely flowing, the submerged aquatic plant Ruppia is common in some summers. Predatory fishes are not present in Younger Lagoon and similar sites, but are found in many other estuaries draining larger watersheds where stickleback and goby co-occur (Wasserman et al. 2020). Many other elements of the ecosystem and community change along the north-south axis of the tidewater goby's range that might impact this interaction, such as climate and the presence of other species (des Roches et al. 2020).Empirical dynamic modeling has been used to make predictions and infer causality, and it is now starting to be used to improve forecasting of commercially valuable fish stocks (Anderson et al. 2008;Ye et al. 2015;Giron-Nava et al. 2020) and to answer questions in community ecology such as determining the effect of biodiversity on stability and the drivers of bottom-up and top-down effects (Sugihara et al. 2012;Ushio et al. 2018;Rogers et al. 2020). As opposed to computing such community-wide metrics, our goal was to understand the environmental factors that affect a particular species of conservation concern and its interspecific interactions (Deyle et al. 2016a).

Empirical dynamic modeling can be used to understand the context dependence in interactions, especially in cases like ours utilizing endangered species, when the usual methods (manipulative experiments) are not an option. Our method allows us to understand the drivers of variation in abundance of the endangered goby and strongly suggests against competition from TSS as a threat to goby population numbers. This information can be used to make decisions about the management of the focal species.

## Abstract
Several years of monitoring in the northern Canadian Arctic Archipelago contrast with a lack of repeated measurements in Queen Maud Gulf. As sea ice cover declines and maritime traffic increases along the Northwest Passage, Queen Maud Gulf, including the protected national historic sites of the HMS Erebus and HMS Terror wrecks, may experience drastic environmental changes. As part of the Kitikmeot Marine Ecosystems Study, moored oceanographic devices including a sediment trap were deployed in Queen Maud Gulf over three consecutive annual cycles from October 2015 to August 2018 to study the functioning of this geographic bottleneck along the Northwest Passage. Seasonal and interannual variability in total particulate matter (TPM), particulate organic carbon (POC), and microalgal fluxes were investigated in relation to wind speed, snow depth, sea ice cover, water temperature, and current velocity. Zooplankton and meroplankton present in the sediment trap were enumerated to monitor their composition and seasonal development. Landfast ice breakup consistently occurred in early June, followed by sea ice breakup in July. The release of sea ice algae was initiated in March 2016, May 2017, and June 2018, whereas peaks in diatom fluxes occurred in August or September. Sustained abundance of pelagic copepods and meroplankton suggested an ecosystem sufficiently productive to support the year-round development of the pelagic and benthic communities. Elevated autumn TPM and POC fluxes reflected wind-induced mixing and resuspension in the absence of ice cover. Our results provide a baseline for evaluating the impact of environmental changes on the Queen Maud Gulf marine ecosystem.",False,False,False,

The quest for a shorter maritime route between Europe and eastern Asia through the Canadian Arctic Archipelago (CAA) dates back to the 15 th century (Ellis and Brigham 2009). After multiple unsuccessful attempts, including the disappearance of the expedition of Sir John Franklin in 1845 onboard HMS Erebus and HMS Terror, the Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen led the first expedition that navigated the Northwest Passage in 1906. With the recent trend in sea ice loss in the CAA, the expected increase in maritime shipping traffic will certainly have an ecological cost on the unique Arctic marine ecosystems along the Northwest Passage due to pollution incidents and introduction of invasive species (Ellis and Brigham 2009). The Queen Maud Gulf, hereafter the Gulf, is a geographic bottleneck along the main targeted route of the Northwest Passage (Liu et al. 2017) where the wrecks of the HMS Erebus and Terror were found in 2014 and 2016, respectively. This discovery and the lack of scientific knowledge on the marine ecosystem of the Gulf initiated the Kitikmeot Marine Ecosystems Study, a partnership project between Parks Canada, the W. Garfield Weston Foundation and ArcticNet to better understand the functioning of the ecosystem and to establish a baseline to evaluate the impacts of future changes in the Gulf region.",False,False,False,
631,10.1002/lno.11628,2,True,"The Gulf is located in the Kitikmeot region of Nunavut, east of Dease Strait and south of Victoria Strait, in the southern region of the CAA (Fig. 1). The Gulf is relatively shallow ( 150 m maximal depth) and water exchange is restricted by sills rising to 18 m in Dolphin and Union Strait west of Coronation Gulf and to 30 m in Victoria Strait (Nelson et al. 2019), characterizing the region as a physical barrier between the eastern and western Canadian Arctic (Bouchard et al. 2018). Waters from the Beaufort Sea flow in a northeastward direction through the Gulf (McLaughlin et al. 2004). Multiyear ice originating from the Arctic Ocean and Queen Elizabeth Islands in the northern region of the CAA is advected southward into the Northwest Passage, but rarely reaches the first-year ice-dominated Gulf region (Howell et al. 2008). Landfast sea ice, defined as motionless sea ice attached to the shore, forms as early as the first week of November and breaks up at the beginning of June in the southern regions of the CAA (Galley et al. 2012). During the melt season, sea ice is no longer landfast and slowly drifts through the numerous shallow and narrow channels of the CAA until complete melt in July (Melling 2002;Howell et al. 2008;Galley et al. 2012). Despite being identified as an oligotrophic flagellate-dominated system based on few summer and fall measurements (Ardyna et al. 2011;Crawford et al. 2018), the centric diatoms Thalassiosira spp. have been reported to dominate the phytoplankton community in the CAA at the end of July in 2007 (Crawford et al. 2018). Several years of measurements in the Barrow Strait area north of the Gulf showed the development of an intense diatom bloom following sea ice breakup, between early June and early August (Michel et al. 2006;Michel et al. 2015). Long-term monitoring in this northern region of the CAA also revealed high interannual variability in nutrient inventories, ice algae biomass and production, the timing of release of ice algae, phytoplankton biomass, and zooplankton biomass (Michel et al. 2006). This variability may have significant repercussions on carbon transfer to the pelagic food web, on pelagic-benthic coupling, and on the productivity of the ecosystem (Michel et al. 2006). Due to a lack of repeated measurements, it remains unknown whether similar interannual variability characterizes the Gulf ecosystem. Copepods dominate the zooplankton community in the Arctic Ocean (Kosobokova and Hopcroft 2010) and are a crucial link in the energy transfer between primary producers and higher trophic levels in the Arctic food web (Falk-Petersen et al. 2009). Apart for few zooplankton measurements previously made in neighboring Coronation Gulf (Nelson et al. 2019) and Barrow Strait (Fortier et al. 2002;Michel et al. 2006), there is a lack of information on the seasonal development of the zooplankton community in the CAA, and measurements in the Gulf are needed to understand their impact on pelagic processes.",False,False,False,

Continuous measurements of water temperature, current velocity, and export fluxes were obtained along with satellite-derived snow depth and sea ice concentration and model-derived wind speed to assess the influence of environmental conditions on the seasonal and interannual variability of the Gulf ecosystem. Zooplankton and meroplankton present in the sediment trap were also used to estimate the seasonal development of secondary producers in the Gulf. Based on the current understanding of oceanographic processes in the northern region of the CAA, reduced sea ice conditions may lead to early production, export, and seasonal development of the zooplankton and meroplankton communities in the Gulf.",False,False,False,

A mooring was deployed for three consecutive annual cycles from October 2015 to August 2018 at nearby positions in the Gulf (Fig. 1; Table 1). The mooring was deployed and recovered during the annual ArcticNet expedition on board the CCGS Amundsen. A sequential sediment trap (Technicap PPS3/3; sampling area: 0.125 m 2 ; 24 sample cups) was deployed at 19, 20, and 37 m above seafloor for the consecutive cycles, respectively (Table 1). The carousel of the sediment trap was programmed to rotate and open a new sampling cup at intervals ranging from 13 to 16 d. Before deployment, each sample cup was filled with filtered seawater adjusted to a salinity of 38 PSU with NaCl to provide a denser solution than ambient seawater and avoid diffusion of content. Sodium borate-buffered formalin (5% v/v) was added to preserve the samples during and after deployment. Sampling was interrupted for 15 d in late August 2016 and in early August 2017 due to the recovery of the sediment trap before the final cup rotation, resulting in the exclusion of the last open sample from the study.An acoustic doppler current profiler (ADCP; Nortek continental or Teledyne RD Instruments RDI SV100) was deployed 18, 13, and 15 m above the sediment trap to measure water temperature and current velocities for each cycle, and a CTD (RBRconcerto) was deployed 14 m above the sediment trap during the last cycle (Table 1).

## Environmental variables
In the Gulf region, the polar day lasts from 24 May to 18 July and the polar night lasts from 06 December to 05 January (Fig. 2a). Sea ice freeze-up (defined as the first day with sea ice concentration > 50%) above the mooring location occurred on 26 October in 2015 and 2017 and on 01 November in 2016 (Fig. 2b). Daily-average sea ice concentration consistently decreased below 60% for a few days in early June but sea ice breakup (defined as sea ice concentration < 50% for more than five consecutive days) occurred on 16, 15, and 19 July for the three cycles (Fig. 2b). Snow accumulated on sea ice soon after its formation in late October or November, while snowmelt (defined as the first day with snow depth < 10 cm) started in late May in 2017 and in early June in 2016 and 2018 (Fig. 2b). Daily-average wind speeds > 10 m s -1 were consistently observed in September and October and remained < 8 m s -1 at all other times (Fig. 2c). High current velocities > 20 cm s -1 were also consistently observed in September and October at 12, 30, and 56 m (Fig. 2d). Maximum current velocities decreased with depth, with peak velocities of 55 cm s -1 recorded at 12 m, 42 cm s -1 at 30 m and 26 cm s -1 at 56 m (Fig. 2d). Water temperatures obtained between 60 and 76 m ranged from -1.6 C to -0.5 C (Fig. 2e). Higher water temperatures (> -1 C) were recorded at 60 m during autumn 2015 and 2017 but remained < -1 C during autumn 2016 when the instrument was deployed at 76 m.

Pseudocalanus spp. individuals of all copepodite stages and adult females were most abundant in late August and September, while C5 were at times relatively abundant during autumn and/or winter and males were usually present from February to September (Fig. 6c).

## Particulate matter fluxes
The TPM and POC fluxes measured in the Gulf combine the downward export, lateral advection, and resuspension of particles derived from multiple sources, such as sea ice melt, marine production, and local rivers. Several rivers, including the Ellice River draining a 16,727 km 2 area of Nunavut, flow northward into the Gulf through flat and marshy land (Alkire et al. 2017). Sediment samples collected over a large area of the CAA revealed a distinct seafloor mineral composition in the Gulf resulting from the inputs of North American Arctic rivers, while other regions of the CAA revealed contents mainly supplied from coastal cliff erosion and sedimentary rocks outcropping (Montero-Serrano and St-Onge 2019). The clear influence of river runoff in the Gulf suggests that TPM and POC fluxes were partially composed of particulate matter supplied from rivers.",False,False,False,
644,10.1002/lno.11628,15,True,"Enhanced TPM and POC fluxes measured at 19 to 37 m above seafloor in the absence of sea ice in September and October often coincided with peaks in wind speed > 10 m s -1 and with increased current velocity reaching > 20 cm s -1 . These elevated fluxes suggest that wind-induced water mixing led to resuspension in the shallow Gulf, supported by correlations between current velocity at 56 m and TPM and POC fluxes (TPM flux and current velocity at 56 m: R 2 = 0.34, p < 0.01; POC flux and current velocity at 56 m: R 2 = 0.27, p < 0.01). These results are in agreement with previous observations from the Mackenzie shelf and Hudson Bay where bottom current speed exceeding 20 cm s -1 were sufficient to resuspend material from the seabed (Forest et al. 2007;Lalande and Fortier 2011;O'Brien et al. 2011). Particulate matter fluxes gradually decreased under reduced current velocities after ice formation, when wind stress had a limited impact on the water column. Continuous westward currents in June and July 2017 (data not shown) along with sustained wind speed > 5 m s -1 and current velocities > 20 cm s -1 starting in late July 2017 likely contributed to the relatively high TPM and POC fluxes observed during summer 2017 in contrast to 2016 and 2018. The enhanced C : N ratios observed during spring and summer 2017 also suggest a different source of particulate matter at that time.",False,False,False,
645,10.1002/lno.11628,16,True,"Peaks in the proportion of POC in the TPM flux during ice melt were partially due to the release of ice algae, as indicated by the correlation between %POC in TPM flux and flux of pennate diatoms containing chloroplasts (R 2 = 0.10, p < 0.01), but most likely resulted from the release of particulate matter from the melting ice. A large quantity of suspended particulate matter is incorporated into ice during freeze-up on shallow shelves, leading to enhanced POC fluxes when released during ice melt (Wegner et al. 2005;Lalande et al. 2020). The lower %POC in TPM fluxes during ice melt in 2017 resulted from the elevated TPM fluxes attenuating the contribution of POC to total fluxes at that time.Annual TPM fluxes in the Gulf (243-290 g m -2 ) were generally higher than TPM fluxes measured at several sites in the Beaufort Sea and Baffin Bay (Hargrave et al. 2002;Forest et al. 2008Forest et al. , 2010;;Lalande et al. 2009) and lower than in southeastern Hudson Bay (1017-3578 g m -2 derived from Lalande and Fortier 2011). Annual POC fluxes (4.2-8.4 g C m -2 ) were in a similar range than POC fluxes observed at other sites in the Canadian Arctic (Hargrave et al. 2002;Forest et al. 2008Forest et al. , 2010;;Lalande et al. 2009) and lower than in Hudson Bay (13-17 g C m -2 derived from Lalande and Fortier 2011). Relatively high annual TPM fluxes in the Gulf illustrated the important input of terrestrial matter from the surrounding coasts and rivers.",False,False,False,
646,10.1002/lno.11628,17,True,"## Sympagic and pelagic diatom export
An abrupt and brief decrease in sea ice concentration above the mooring site in June of the 3 years sampled reflected the landfast ice breakup typically observed in early June in the Gulf region (Galley et al. 2012). Diatom fluxes at the time of the landfast ice breakup were due to the sloughing of sea ice algae and the export of ice-associated algae triggered by the opening in the sea ice at a time of maximum solar radiation, creating adverse warming and melting conditions for the sympagic algal community (Michel et al. 1996). The preponderance of pennate diatoms in the diatom fluxes at that time supports the release of ice algae, as pennate diatoms are the most abundant sea ice protists across the Arctic Ocean (Hop et al. 2020). The large diatom flux observed in early June 2016, composed of the exclusively sympagic diatom M. arctica, of the epiphyte diatom Synedropsis spp. growing on M. arctica (Syvertsen 1991), and of the ice-associated diatoms Achnantes spp., Fragilariopsis spp., F. arctica, Licmophora spp., and Pseudo-nitzschia/Nitzschia spp. suggests a higher sea ice algae production prior to landfast ice breakup during spring 2016 than in 2017 and 2018. Larger ice algal biomass possibly reflected a larger inflow of nutrient-rich waters of Pacific origin in 2016, in agreement with observations of large interannual variability in primary production attributed to a variable Pacific Water inflow in the CAA (McLaughlin et al. 2004;Michel et al. 2006Michel et al. , 2015;;Apollonio and Matrai 2011). In nearby Dease Strait, increased surface currents under landfast ice have been reported to enhance nutrient flux to the ice bottom and increase ice algal Chl a biomass (Dalman et al. 2019). Therefore, the higher subsurface current velocities recorded in the Gulf during winter and spring 2016 possibly contributed to a larger nutrient supply and ice algal biomass that year. Low fluxes of the ice-associated Pseudonitzschia/Nitzschia spp. and Fragilariopsis spp. and of the exclusively sympagic N. frigida were also observed from March to May in 2016, prior to the landfast sea ice breakup. While N. frigida usually dominates the ice algal assemblage (Michel et al. 1996;Poulin et al. 2011;Galindo et al. 2014;Mundy et al. 2014) and is typically one of the first diatoms exported at the onset of snowmelt (Cota et al. 1991;Fortier et al. 2002;Dezutter et al. 2019;Lalande et al. 2019), its presence at depth prior to any melt suggests that another mechanism contributed to its early export along with other sympagic algae. Bottom ice erosion caused by the stronger currents observed near the surface in March and April 2016 may have contributed to the early export of sea ice algae, as previously observed during intense spring tides in Resolute Passage (Conover et al. 1986;Michel et al. 1996;Galindo et al. 2014).",False,False,False,
647,10.1002/lno.11628,18,True,"The increase in sea ice concentration in late June reflected the slow drift of sea ice into the region during the snow and sea ice melt period (Melling 2002;Howell et al. 2008), followed by a gradual decrease in sea ice concentration until complete ice melt in July. Previous observations in the Barrow Strait area of the CAA reported the development of an under ice phytoplankton bloom following the onset of sea ice melt at the end of June (Michel et al. 1996;Fortier et al. 2002;Mundy et al. 2014), and maximum Chl a biomass values reached after sea ice breakup at the end of July-early August (Michel et al. 2006). Due to strong stratification following sea ice melt and the seasonal shallowing of the pycnocline, most algae remain in suspension in the surface layer until increased mixing by wind (Michel et al. 1996(Michel et al. , 2015)). In agreement with these observations, a peak in diatom export mainly composed of the exclusively pelagic diatoms Chaetoceros spp. and Thalassiosira spp. in early September 2016, and a peak in diatom export mostly composed of Chaetoceros spp. associated with elevated concentration of suspended Chl a at 61 m in late August 2017, reflected the export of the pelagic diatom bloom at times of increased wind speeds and current velocities, several weeks after the late July sea ice breakup. Chaetoceros spp. and Thalassiosira spp. often dominate blooms over the shallow Arctic continental shelves (Von Quillfeldt 2000;Poulin et al. 2011;Krawczyk et al. 2018;Selz et al. 2018), and were the dominant diatoms under the ice in June in Resolute Passage (Mundy et al. 2014). High abundances of Thalassiosira spp. were also reported in late July in the CAA (Crawford et al. 2018). Although not sampled, it is likely that the export of a pelagic bloom also occurred in August and/or September in 2015 and 2018, suggesting little interannual variability in the timing of sea ice breakup and the subsequent export of the centric diatoms composing the bloom in the Gulf. Similarly, phytoplankton production consistently reached maximum values at the end of July-early August from 1983 to 1993 following sea ice breakup during July in Barrow Strait (Michel et al. 2006). Annual diatom fluxes in the Gulf ( 1500-3000 million cells m -2 ) were higher or similar to those obtained during 5 out of 6 years at 125 m at the Beaufort Sea shelf break (derived from Dezutter et al. 2019). These results suggest that the central CAA region is more productive than previously reported (Ardyna et al. 2011;Crawford et al. 2018) and support a previous estimate that the eastern CAA may contribute up to 32% of the total primary production of Arctic shelves (Michel et al. 2006), highlighting the importance of sustained observations to accurately assess the productivity of ice-covered ecosystems.",False,False,False,
648,10.1002/lno.11628,19,True,"## Zooplankton and copepod community
Copepods were the most numerous zooplankton collected in the sediment trap, in agreement with results obtained with net sampling showing that pelagic copepods dominate the zooplankton community in terms of abundance and biomass in the CAA (Fortier et al. 2002;Michel et al. 2006;Nelson et al. 2019). Among the non-copepod taxa, the pteropod L. helicina and appendicularians were also relatively abundant, similar to net collections made in nearby Coronation Gulf and Bathurst Inlet (Nelson et al. 2019). These taxa must play an important role in the carbon cycle of the Gulf ecosystem through grazing and production of fecal pellets (Turner 2015). L. helicina also contributes to the transformation, export and sequestration of atmospheric CO 2 through the fabrication and export of its aragonite shell at depth (Bauerfeind et al. 2014;Lischka and Hagen 2016). Appendicularians are important filter feeders that contribute significantly to the vertical particle flux through the production of fast sinking fecal pellets and sedimentation of discarded houses (Bauerfeind et al. 1997). While a strong association between water temperature and zooplankton productivity and the timing of its growth season has been observed in Barrow Strait (Hamilton et al. 2013;Michel et al. 2015), the growth and reproduction of copepods and the presence of L. helicina and appendicularians during winter and early spring suggest a weak association between water temperature and zooplankton productivity in the Gulf.",False,False,False,
649,10.1002/lno.11628,20,True,"With a composition dominated by M. longa, Microcalanus spp., Pseudocalanus spp., O. similis, T. borealis, and C. glacialis, the sediment trap assemblage was similar to the zooplankton community of Resolute Passage (Michel et al. 2006). While the large oceanic copepod C. hyperboreus dominates the mesozooplankton biomass on the deep margins of the Arctic shelf seas and has frequently been observed in Barrow Strait (Michel et al. 2006;Darnis et al. 2019), only low numbers of C. hyperboreus stage C3 and older were collected in the sediment trap in the Gulf (Fig. 5e). As the life-history strategy of C. hyperboreus involves a long overwintering season in diapause at depths of several hundred to thousands of meters (Ashjian et al. 2003;Darnis et al. 2019), it is unlikely that successful reproduction occurs in the rather shallow Gulf, explaining the absence of younger copepodite stages. Furthermore, vertical distribution of this species mostly at depth for a major part of the year would prevent its transport over the Gulf shoaling.",False,False,False,
650,10.1002/lno.11628,21,True,"The description of the seasonal development of the dominant copepods provides further information on their lifecycles in the Gulf. In the Arctic Ocean, the income breeders Pseudocalanus spp. and C. glacialis exploit sea ice algae to fuel their egg production and the ensuing phytoplankton bloom to fuel their growth, development, and lipid storage (Runge and Ingram 1991;Tourangeau and Runge 1991;Wold et al. 2011;Daase et al. 2013). The high numbers of Pseudocalanus spp. and C. glacialis collected during the peak of diatom export suggested such life-history strategy and a match between algal production and herbivorous grazers in the Gulf. Timing of reproduction was reflected first in the increasing abundance of Pseudocalanus spp./C. glacialis naupliar stages matching with the period of sea ice algal production and release in the water column in spring and summer, and, second, in the high abundance of copepodite stages of all species, in particular young copepodites of Pseudocalanus spp. and C. glacialis, coinciding with the export of the diatom bloom during late summer. The large proportion of naupliar stage N1 among the nauplii collected at depth was likely the consequence of their inability to swim (Ota et al. 2008). The early occurrence of nauplii and of feeding naupliar stage N3 in 2016 supports an enhanced sea ice algae production, biomass, and export that year. The higher ice algal biomass may also explain the higher numbers of Pseudocalanus spp. collected in autumn 2016, in agreement with the highest abundance and egg production of Pseudocalanus acuspes observed during a year of abundant ice algae in Barrow Strait (Fortier et al. 2002). While C. glacialis copepodite stages C1 and C2 were only observed from July to September, young copepodites of Pseudocalanus spp. were always observed in high numbers during summer and sporadically observed in low numbers throughout the sampling. This discrepancy suggests the production of a single generation of C. glacialis in summer (Daase et al. 2013) while Pseudocalanus spp. also reproduces during autumn and winter, as revealed by the presence of Pseudocalanus spp. C1 and C2 from October to February in the Amundsen Gulf of the Beaufort Sea (Darnis and Fortier 2014).",False,False,False,
651,10.1002/lno.11628,22,True,"By contrast, the distinct abundance pattern of the omnivorous copepods M. longa and Microcalanus spp. are explained by a different life-history strategy than the major herbivore copepods. Both taxa are generally active year-round in Arctic waters, feeding on microzooplankton, detritus, and microalgae to sustain their development and complete a 1 yr life-cycle (Tande and Grønvik 1983;Ashjian et al. 2003;Lischka and Hagen 2016). For M. longa, the clear transition from young copepodite stages C1-C2 to C5 and adults from autumn to the following summer confirms an annual life cycle and the development of a single generation per year in the Gulf, as previously reported in the CAA (Conover and Huntley 1991). Young stages C1 and C2 indicated a lengthy reproduction season ( 6 months) each year following the late summer diatom bloom, in contrast to the sustained reproduction observed throughout the year based on the yearly presence of all copepodites stages in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas (Ashjian et al. 2003) and in Kongsfjorden, Svalbard (Lischka and Hagen 2016). The relatively high abundance of the oceanic M. longa (Darnis et al. 2008) in the shallow Gulf may reflect an overestimation by the sediment trap but nonetheless provide crucial insight on its life cycle in the CAA. The continuous collection of Microcalanus spp. of all copepodite stages suggests a sustained reproduction in the Gulf, similar to the coincident presence of all Microcalanus spp. copepodite stages observed throughout the year in the Western Arctic Ocean (Ashjian et al. 2003) and Kongsfjorden (Lischka and Hagen 2016). Omnivorous copepods in abundance may be an important food source for the higher trophic levels, especially during winter. On the other hand, they also contribute to recycling organic carbon and to the attenuation of downward POC fluxes (Ashjian et al. 2003;Berge et al. 2015).",False,False,False,
652,10.1002/lno.11628,23,True,"## Nematodes and meroplankton
The high abundance of nematodes during the sea ice melt period from May to July was most likely due to their release from the sea ice. Nematodes have been identified as an important component of the sea ice meiofauna in Arctic regions where coastal or first-year landfast ice prevails, such as in the Beaufort Sea off the coast of Alaska, in the North Water Polynya, and in Barrow Strait (Carey and Montagna 1982;Kern and Carey 1983;Riemann and Sime-Ngando 1997;Nozais et al. 2001). Larger nematode export in the Gulf during spring 2016 may be a response to higher food availability due to a larger abundance of sympagic algae possibly contributing to the enhanced development of the sea ice meiofauna, as observed in the Beaufort Sea (Carey and Montagna 1982). The absence of nematodes when sea ice algae were released in March and April 2016 likely indicated their low abundance within the ice at that time of the year, as nematode abundance has been reported to rapidly increase due to reproduction from April to late May or June in the shallow Beaufort Sea (Carey and Montagna 1982;Kern and Carey 1983;Carey 1992) and in Resolute Passage (Riemann and Sime-Ngando 1997). The absence of nematodes at times of intensified current velocities and sediment resuspension in September and October further support the sympagic origin of the nematodes collected at depth.",False,False,False,
653,10.1002/lno.11628,24,True,"While increased meroplankton abundance is often associated with the phytoplankton bloom period in northern and Arctic waters (Stübner et al. 2016;Michelsen et al. 2017;Walczy nska et al. 2019), the near constant presence of bivalve veligers, echinoderm larvae and polychaete larvae throughout the study period suggested the spawning of benthic organisms in the Gulf or the advection of planktotrophic larvae from surrounding regions. This sustained presence of meroplankton in the water column possibly indicated a diverse benthic community with distinct feeding and reproductive strategies. The higher current velocities and sea ice algae export during spring 2016 may have contributed to the generally larger abundance of meroplankton through enhanced advection from nearby areas and/or improved feeding conditions. Meroplankton are certainly important trophic components in the Gulf pelagic ecosystem, both as grazers and as prey for upper trophic levels, as observed in other high-Arctic areas (Stübner et al. 2016).",False,False,False,
654,10.1002/lno.11628,25,True,"## Implications for the future Queen Maud Gulf region
Three years of continuous monitoring based on an oceanographic mooring indicated that important components of the Gulf marine ecosystem are influenced by an annual cycle of landfast ice breakup in June, sea ice melt in July, export of the diatom bloom in August-September, and a variable timing and magnitude in sea ice algae export. These observations concur with previous observations of high interannual variability in ice algae biomass and production and in the timing of release of ice algae under landfast ice in the Barrow Strait area of the CAA (Michel et al. 1996(Michel et al. , 2006;;Fortier et al. 2002). Earlier and larger sea ice algae export in 2016 in the Gulf led to an earlier development of copepod nauplii, earlier and larger export of nematodes, and larger meroplankton abundance during spring, clearly showing the importance of sea ice algae for this shallow Arctic shelf ecosystem.Significant trends toward shorter landfast sea ice duration were recently reported for the Gulf region, with sea ice breakup occurring 2.8 d earlier per decade since 1979 (Galley et al. 2012). This change in the timing of sea ice breakup may reduce the growth period of ice algae and lead to the earlier development of pelagic phytoplankton blooms upon stratification of the surface layer. However, models predict that increased ice melt along with stronger precipitation and river discharge will increase surface layer stratification in the southern CAA, potentially limiting nutrient input in surface waters and hence primary production (Wassmann 2011).Simulation results showed that the Queen Maud Gulf route, one of the two main routes of the Northwest Passage, will continuously be accessible in 20 years (Sou and Flato 2009), suggesting a potential increase in maritime traffic through the Gulf in the near future. Shipping traffic has already increased in the Northwest Passage, with the number of vessels and the total kilometers traveled annually almost doubling in the Canadian Arctic from 1990 to 2015 (Pizzolato et al. 2014;Dawson et al. 2018). The data presented here therefore provide a baseline for evaluating the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the marine ecosystem of the Gulf.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Phytoplankton dynamics in coastal ecosystems is increasingly altered by land-based human activities. Yet, this global vision conceals major disparities, among sites and through time. As conventional monitoring time series are quite sparse and relatively short, biological records of environmental variability appear as relevant tools to gain insights into phytoplankton dynamics over larger temporal and spatial scales. Here, we present results of an interdisciplinary project dealing with chemical information archived in shells of Pecten maximus (Bivalvia; Pectinidae), known to form daily growth striae on its shell surface. Several individuals were collected in the Bay of Brest (France) in 2011 and 2012, and analyzed for the molybdenum and lithium concentrations in their soft tissues and the element-to-calcium ratios (Mo : Ca and Li : Ca) in their calcitic striae. All shells revealed high synchrony and reproducibility in their Mo : Ca and Li : Ca profiles, characterized with a major peak at the end of May and in mid-June 2011, respectively. Detailed analysis of physical, chemical, and biological variables measured in seawater during an extensive 9-month environmental survey enabled a meticulous description of phytoplankton dynamics in 2011 and its impact on shell geochemistry. Main findings strongly suggest that (1) the timing of Mo : Ca peaks reflects the occurrence of silicon limitation and diatom aggregation periods, (2) the height of these peaks relates to the amplitude of the first spring diatom bloom, and (3) Li : Ca serves as a proxy for the temporal dynamics of diatom biovolume and of biogenic silica recycling at the sediment-water interface.",False,False,False,
660,10.1002/lno.11985,1,True,"## Untitled Section
Phytoplankton is the cornerstone of the oceans, forming the pedestal of almost all marine food webs. Although making up only 0.2% of the total photosynthetic biomass on Earth, these tiny organisms are responsible for approx. 46% of the annual global net primary production (Field et al. 1998). Among phytoplankton, diatoms are by far the main contributors to global net primary production (approx. 50%), together with coccolithophores and chlorophytes (approx. 20% each), and finally cyanobacteria (approx. 10%; Rousseaux and Gregg 2014). Up to 25% of this production occurs on continental margins (Boyce et al. 2010) that yet occupy a mere 7% of the ocean surface. These shallow-water ecosystems are strongly affected by land-based human activities. For instance, enhanced nitrogen and phosphorus loadings can change the natural ratios between nutrients, leading to quantitative and qualitative alterations in phytoplankton communities. A decrease in the Si/N ratio (due to enhanced nitrogen supply) can result in shifts in phytoplankton communities initially dominated by silicified species (diatoms) toward nonsilicified species (e.g., dinoflagellates) that are sometimes toxic (Cloern 2001).Given its crucial role in the functioning of oceanic and coastal ecosystems, and more broadly in the global biogeochemical carbon cycle and regulation of the climate of the Earth, it is paramount to characterize the spatial and temporal variabilities of phytoplankton dynamics. This is commonly achieved using remote sensing since the first satellite sensors were launched in the late 1970s. This approach is undoubtedly very useful, specifically because it provides the largest possible spatial coverage. However, its limited temporal extent (approx. two decades) renders the identification of long-term, pluridecadal, trends very difficult. Remote sensing also has significant limitations in coastal waters where high levels of suspended particulate matter and colored dissolved organic matter can significantly influence optical properties of surface waters, thus altering phytoplankton estimates (Blondeau-Patissier et al. 2014).",False,False,False,
661,10.1002/lno.11985,2,True,"Conventional monitoring time series (electronic instruments, periodic water sampling) provide reliable information in coastal ecosystems, and are essential to detect, measure, and understand changes in the Earth system and its biological communities. Remarkable long-term, still ongoing, examples are the Helgoland series which started in the German Bight in 1962 (Hickel 1998), and the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey launched in the North Sea and North-East Atlantic in 1948 (Warner and Hays 1994). However, most other observational phytoplankton records are too short to encompass natural lowfrequency cycles in coastal environments. Moreover, such data sets are relatively scattered and thus poorly replicated. Some studies attempted to combine transparency-derived (Secchi disk measurements) and in situ chlorophyll data in order to get longer records (110 years long; Boyce et al. 2010) but such data blending could lead to significant biases in the estimation of chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration (Mackas 2011). Therefore, the development of new tools aiming at reconstructing longterm, high-resolution, estimates of phytoplankton dynamics are necessary to get a better understanding of macroecological changes in coastal ecosystems.",False,False,False,
662,10.1002/lno.11985,3,True,"Within this framework, biogenic archives of environmental variability may embody a valuable approach for extending phytoplankton records over longer time scales. Indeed, corals, sclerosponges, coralline algae, or mollusk shells form their external calcium carbonate skeleton periodically, leading to the accretion of growth increments and lines (aka ""striae"" in pectinids). Providing their periodicity of formation is known, these structures can in turn serve as chronological benchmarks to place each portion of a given archive into precise temporal context (a major component of the research field of ""sclerochronology""). Corals, sclerosponges and coralline algae are powerful tools for investigations on past environmental variability with a seasonal to annual resolution. However, in highly dynamic systems such as coastal waters, many ecological processes such as phytoplankton blooms occur on daily or weekly time scales. From that prospect, bivalve mollusk shells appear as outstanding archives for high-resolution paleoecological studies because many species form distinct daily growth patterns. These biocarbonates can therefore provide detailed, daily-resolved records of environmental variables. The latter are archived in shells in the form of geochemical properties such as stable isotopes and minor and trace elements (Peharda et al. 2021).",False,False,False,
663,10.1002/lno.11985,4,True,"Most studies dealing with geochemical composition of bivalve shells focused on proxies for seawater temperature. Yet, their potential as archives for phytoplankton dynamics has been overlooked. Historically, such studies first attempted to use the stable carbon isotope composition of shells as a paleoproductivity proxy, reflecting the isotope signature of dissolved inorganic carbon (Mook and Vogel 1968). However, the δ 13 C shell values often also reflect the isotope signal of metabolic carbon that ends up in the shell during shell formation (Marchais et al., 2015). Inspired by deep-sea oceanographic studies, the barium-to-calcium ratio (Ba : Ca) measured in shells has long been the most promising tool to assess phytoplankton dynamics. Indeed, ontogenetic variations of Ba : Ca have a similar profile in many bivalve species, that is, a background value (with variations possibly reflecting changes in salinity; Poulain et al. 2015) interrupted by sharp peaks which are often synchronous between contemporaneous specimens from the same locality (Doré et al. 2020). Phytoplankton blooms (especially diatoms) have often been put forward as the most likely drivers of Ba : Ca peaks in shells. However, this relationship is definitely not straightforward, and factors controlling Ba : Ca variations are still puzzling and not sufficiently understood (Gillikin et al. 2008).",False,False,False,
664,10.1002/lno.11985,5,True,"More recently, molybdenum-to-calcium (Mo : Ca) and lithium-to-calcium (Li : Ca) ratios in bivalve shells have been suggested as promising proxies for phytoplankton bloom dynamics (Thébault et al. 2009a;Barats et al. 2010;Thébault and Chauvaud 2013;Sadatzki et al. 2019). However, the influence of phytoplankton dynamics on Mo and Li incorporation in bivalve shells has been put in doubt in two recent studies on common cockles and Arctic bivalves (Füllenbach et al. 2015;Vihtakari et al. 2017). Undoubtedly, the extreme scarcity of studies dealing with Mo and Li prevents conclusions about the exact mechanisms behind their incorporation into bivalve shells. More studies are required to determine how faithful Mo : Ca and Li : Ca ratios archived in shells record changes in phytoplankton biomass and composition in coastal ecosystems.In summary, existing proxies for phytoplankton dynamics in bivalve shells are still not well constrained. The present study thus focuses on Mo : Ca and Li : Ca ratios in shells of P. maximus from the Bay of Brest (France). This scallop species has major advantages for sclerochronological investigations, including a rapid shell growth rate (up to several hundreds of micrometers per day) and the presence of clearly visible annual and daily external growth lines on its shell (Fig. 1). This common species has a biogeographical distribution spanning the entire European Atlantic coastline, extending from Northern Norway (Lofoten islands) to Southern Portugal (and beyond to Morocco via Azores). Moreover, it has many very close relative species all over the world, with very similar characteristics (e.g., Pecten jacobeus in the Mediterranean, Pecten fumatus in Australia, Pecten albicans along the coasts of Japan and China, Pecten novaezelandiae endemic to New Zealand, Pecten sulcicostatus in South Africa, or Leopecten diegensis from California and Mexico).

## Study area
Our study site, the Pointe de Lanvéoc (48 17 0 39 00 N-4 27 0 12 00 W), is located in the southern part of the Bay of Brest (Brittany, Northwest France; Fig. 2). The Bay of Brest is a semienclosed, macro-tidal, marine ecosystem of 180 km 2 connected to shelf waters (Iroise Sea, North-East Atlantic) by a narrow and deep strait (2 km width, 40 m max. depth). The bay itself is a shallow basin with an average depth of 10 m. The shoals are relatively wide, and only 15% of the total area is deeper than 20 m. Two rivers, the Aulne (catchment area = 1792 km 2 ) and the Elorn (catchment area = 379 km 2 ), are responsible for up to 80% of the total freshwater input into the bay. The fieldwork was carried out between gabions #2 and #3 of the former oil terminal jetty, approx. 150 m north of the shore (average depth at mid-tide = 10 m). The floor is characterized by mixed sandy and silty sediments, with significant amounts of large biogenic detritus (shells, calcareous algae).",False,False,False,

Live scallops were collected using SCUBA diving at each cruise. All of them were individuals of age class II (i.e., specimens that have lived through two 1 st of January, therefore showing two annual (winter) growth lines on their left [flat] valve) in order to get a sufficient mass of soft tissues for elemental analyses (and also because age class I specimens were too small to be pinpointed by SCUBA divers in the first half of the environmental survey). These specimens were sacrificed immediately after return to the laboratory (within 3 h after collection). The mantle, gills, gonad, digestive gland, and adductor muscle were dissected from each specimen (in this order). Dissecting tools were cleaned with 95% ethanol after removal of each organ. All soft tissues were weighed to the nearest mg, frozen at À20 C and then freeze-dried. These samples were finally chemically characterized (lithium and molybdenum).By the end of the survey, age class I scallops were large enough to be observed by divers and nine of them were harvested on 30 August 2011 (three shells) and 24 October 2011 (six shells). The left valves of these specimens were then analyzed for their Li and Mo content incorporated during the 1 st full year of growth, that is, between the 1 st winter growth check and the ventral margin (Fig. 1). Four age class II specimens were also collected in October 2011 to identify potential age-related differences in Li and Mo profiles of the shells. For these four specimens, chemical analyses were performed on the shell portion between the 2 nd winter growth check (line) and the ventral margin.In order to check whether the element content in shells from Lanvéoc reflects the skeletal concentrations in other scallops from the Bay of Brest, three age class II specimens were collected alive by dredging on Roscanvel bank (water depth = approx. 25 m; distance from Lanvéoc = approx. 6 km; Fig. 2) on 05 January 2012.

Prior to shell growth and chemical analyses, left valves of all specimens listed in Supporting Information Table S1 were cleaned by soaking in 90% acetic acid for 30-45 s, rinsed with deionized water and air-dried. Daily shell growth rates were determined by measuring distances between successive striae along the axis of maximum growth using image analysis software (ImageJ). Based on the daily periodicity of stria formation, each shell portion was placed in precise temporal context by backdating from the last stria deposited at the day of collection.Trace element content in these shells was analyzed using two different techniques, in three different laboratories (Supporting Information Table S1). Shells A-C were investigated at Pôle Spectrométrie Océan (PSO, France) using solution nebulization inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Shells D-S were measured using a laser ablation unit coupled with an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer, either at the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (MPIC, Germany) or at the Institute of Analytical Sciences and Physico-Chemistry for Environment and Materials (IPREM, France).

## Element-to-calcium ratios in scallop shells
Irrespective of the analytical method, study site or age class, all shells revealed similar Mo : Ca (Fig. 3A) and Li : Ca profiles (Fig. 3B). They were characterized by a relatively flat background around 0.05 and 40 μmol mol À1 for Mo : Ca and Li : Ca, respectively. A large Mo : Ca peak occurred in all specimens at the end of May 2011 (maximum value reached between 22 May 2011 and 01 June 2011), ranging from 0.179 μmol mol À1 (shell D, on 27 May 2011) to 0.474 μmol mol À1 (shell H, on 25 May 2011). Similarly, a large Li : Ca peak was measured in all shells in mid-June 2011: The maximum value (116 μmol mol À1 in shell B, 392 μmol mol À1 in shell N) was reached between 14 and 20 June 2011.Shells sampled at Roscanvel (specimens K, L, and M) had Mo : Ca (W = 4758, p < 0.001) and Li : Ca (W = 4005, p < 0.001) median values significantly higher than shells collected at Lanvéoc and measured in the same laboratory (specimens G, H, and J). However, Mo : Ca peaks were of similar height (0.257 μmol mol À1 at Roscanvel vs. 0.286 μmol mol À1 at Lanvéoc), as were Li : Ca peaks (203 and 161 μmol mol À1 at Roscanvel and Lanvéoc, respectively).Furthermore, the comparison between Lanvéoc shells analyzed at IPREM for their 1 st and 2 nd year of growth did not reveal significant differences for Mo : Ca ratios (W = 3019, p < 0.001).

## Spring bloom dynamics
The 2011 spring phytoplankton dynamics in the Bay of Brest was characterized by a first, plurispecific (Chaetoceros spp., Ce. pelagica, and D. fragilissimus) diatom bloom in early May, followed by a second, monospecific (Chaetoceros spp.) diatom bloom in early June (Fig. 6). While the Chl a concentration reached its annual maximum during the first bloom, the maximum phytoplankton cell concentration was observed during the second bloom. This can be explained with the different sizes and biovolumes of the diatom species involved in these two blooms. Chaetoceros spp. have relatively small cells while Ce. pelagica and D. fragilissimus are usually large diatoms (with biovolumes approx. one order of magnitude higher than Chaetoceros spp.; Olenina et al. 2006). Considering (1) the diatom cell concentrations during the first and second spring blooms, (2) the respective contributions of Chaetoceros, Cerataulina, and Dactyliosolen, and (3) a 1 : 10 ratio for biovolumes of Chaetoceros and Cerataulina/ Dactyliosolen single cells, we estimated that the diatom total biovolume could have been only 1.4 times higher during the second bloom. This suggests that the total phytoplanktonic biovolumes (and, therefore, Chl a concentrations) were likely comparable between these two spring blooms, despite very different phytoplankton cell quantities.",False,False,False,

The comparison between in situ nutrient concentrations to half-saturation constants for nutrient uptake (K m ) is an interesting approach to highlight nutrient limitation. According to Del Amo et al. (1997), K m values for dissolved inorganic nitrogen and silicates in the Bay of Brest are close to 2 μmol L À1 . Nutrient concentrations below this threshold correspond to stressful nutritional conditions limiting phytoplankton growth. Nitrate and silicate concentrations dropped below their K m values between 21 and 26 April 2011, although the maximum Chl a concentration was reached approx. 1.5 weeks later. However, another nitrogen source could have been used for phytoplankton growth, namely dissolved organic nitrogen. The latter has been recognized as an important N source for phytoplankton communities. Urea and free amino acids can substantially contribute to the spring bloom production in coastal waters (Moschonas et al. 2017). Unfortunately, dissolved organic nitrogen concentration was not measured during this survey. Nevertheless, it is admitted that it frequently exceeds that of dissolved inorganic nitrogen in both marine and freshwater ecosystems (Berman and Bronk 2003). Therefore, as already noticed by Del Amo et al. (1997), silicon was likely the primary limiting factor in the Bay of Brest, responsible for the collapse of the first, diatom-dominated, spring bloom.",False,False,False,
680,10.1002/lno.11985,21,True,"While silicates were already limiting growth at the end of April, diatom cells kept on photosynthesizing for a few days under nutrient stress. Such conditions are known to accelerate diatom sinking and to result in the formation of aggregates in the water column. Indeed, many diatom genera (including Chaetoceros) can form aggregates (marine snow) when their cells collide and then stick together (Alldredge and Gotschalk 1989). Diatom stickiness is strongly affected by the production of extracellular polymeric substances which increases under nutrient limitation (Thornton 2002). Production of such substances can then lead to the formation of transparent exopolymeric particles which are major agents of diatom aggregation (Passow 2000). Crocker and Passow (1995) noticed that Chaetoceros can cause aggregation by generating transparent exopolymeric particles which, in turn, scavenge cells into aggregates. Conditions for diatom aggregate formation were certainly met in the Bay of Brest in early May 2011: The development of a large bloom mostly consisted of diatoms (dominated by Chaetoceros) and occurred under nutrient limitation.This hypothesis is reinforced with scallop daily shell growth rate which was strongly reduced in early May 2011 (À28% in 5 d; Supporting Information Fig. S1). Spring shell growth retardations are quite common in P. maximus from the Bay of Brest. They have often been explained by the sedimentation of large diatom aggregates (especially Chaetoceros) which affects food intake and/or respiratory activity of the scallops by gill clogging or oxygen depletion (Lorrain et al. 2000).",False,False,False,

(1994) already pointed out that silicon recycling at the sediment-water interface is the main contributor to the silicate pool responsible for the late spring bloom in the Bay of Brest. Nitrate pool was not replenished in early June (Fig. 7), but the June Chaetoceros bloom may have used nitrogen from the dissolved organic nitrogen pool. As the water column was not nutrient-limited in early June, it is unlikely that this bloom formed aggregates. This statement is reinforced by the lack of shell growth retardation in June (Supporting Information Fig. S1).",False,False,False,

In order to check whether Mo : Ca and Li : Ca time series differed among collection sites in the Bay of Brest and according to the ontogenetic age of the scallops, we analyzed three batches of shells in the same laboratory to preclude methodology-related discrepancies (IPREM): (1) 1 st year of growth in specimens collected at Lanvéoc and Roscanvel, and (2) specimens belonging to different age classes (1 st and 2 nd year of shell growth) collected at the same locality (Lanvéoc).Whereas the Mo : Ca and Li : Ca background levels were slightly higher in shells from Roscanvel (difference reflected in a statistically higher median value compared with shells from Lanvéoc), the Mo : Ca and Li : Ca peak heights were very similar at both localities (Fig. 3). However, the most striking feature is the synchronicity of respective peaks in shells from the two sites. The main Mo : Ca peak occurred 1 day earlier in shells from Roscanvel (24 May 2011) compared with those from Lanvéoc. This difference is likely not significant given the sampling strategy set to laser ablation every third stria. As for the spring Li : Ca peak, it appeared on the exact same date (18 June 2011) at both localities.Such a synchronicity suggests that the environmental phenomenon responsible for the incorporation of large amounts of Mo and Li in scallop shells likely occurred at a large spatial scale. At Roscanvel, scallops were harvested in relatively deep waters (À25 m), closer to the strait connecting the bay to the Atlantic Ocean, in comparison with specimens collected in shallow waters (approx. -10 m) from Lanvéoc. This study site is more subject to the influence of the Aulne estuarine waters than Roscanvel. Despite these major discrepancies, trace element profiles in scallop shells were very similar, suggesting that both habitats experienced a similar springtime event in the well-mixed water column.",False,False,False,
683,10.1002/lno.11985,24,True,"Geochemical analyses in P. maximus are usually performed on the shell portions formed between the 1 st and 2 nd winter growth check. The reason behind this strategy is that scallops of this age class have the longest annual growing season and thus accumulate the longest annual geochemical record. In addition, their daily shell growth rates are higher than on age class II+ scallops, which enable a better temporal resolution in geochemical analyses. However, harvesting of age class I scallops can sometimes be tricky as they are too small to be retained by scallop dredges or spotted by divers. Therefore, age class II+ scallops are often more easily captured. Our results did not reveal significant differences in the 2011 Mo : Ca time series in scallop shell portions formed between the 1 st and 2 nd winter growth check or after the 2 nd winter growth check (Fig. 3), thus ruling out a possible ontogenetic effect on Mo and Li incorporation in shells. On the other hand, it seems that the springtime Li : Ca peak was more intense in shells of age class II scallops compared with younger specimens (average values: 233 and 161 μmol mol À1 , respectively; Fig. 3). However, a careful examination of these results suggests that this difference is mostly related to specimen N, which showed a much higher Li : Ca peak (392 μmol mol À1 ) compared with other age class II specimens (194-201 μmol mol À1 ). No satisfactory explanation can be put forward to elucidate this interindividual variability.

The most striking features in age class I P. maximus shells are (1) the Mo : Ca peak recorded at the end of May 2011 and (2) the Li : Ca peak archived in mid-June 2011 (Fig. 4). As noticed in the previous section, these sudden increases in element levels likely occurred in all scallop shells from the Bay of Brest, whatever their age or sampling locality. This strongly suggests the existence of common environmental drivers responsible for the incorporation of large amounts of Mo and Li into the shells during the spring phytoplankton blooms (Fig. 9).",False,False,False,
685,10.1002/lno.11985,26,True,"## Mo : Ca ratio
Such a high inter-individual reproducibility has already been observed for Mo : Ca in scallop shells, including P. maximus (Barats et al. 2010) and Decatopecten (Comptopallium) radula (Thébault et al. 2009a). The incorporation of Mo in scallop shells could originate from both the dissolved and particulate phases in seawater. DMo usually appears to be conservative in the ocean (Collier 1985). Nevertheless, a systematic deficit in DMo was recorded over a 6-month period at the studied coastal station of Lanvéoc (January-June 2011), with a loss reaching 20 nmol L À1 (Fig. 8A). This was related to the incorporation of Mo in particles within the maximum turbidity zone of the inner estuary (Waeles et al. 2013). If phytoplankton activity was not responsible for DMo loss, this statement does not hold true for PMo. PMo concentrations were relatively low (< 0.1 nmol L À1 ) over the period of January to March (Fig. 8A). Over this high freshwater discharge period (Aulne River water discharge ranging from 20 to 70 m 3 s À1 ; Waeles et al. 2013), PMo should essentially correspond to lithogenic particles exported from the river/estuarine maximum turbidity zone. The beginning of PMo increase in April 2011 is clearly initiated with the onset of spring phytoplankton development. However, the uptake by phytoplankton cells, whose requirements have been estimated at 0.05-0.87 μmol of Mo mol À1 C (average = 0.22 μmol Mo mol À1 C; Ho et al. 2003), cannot alone explain the high increase of the PMo : POC ratio (from 5 to 15 μmol mol À1 ) in April 2011 (Fig. 8B). Moreover, the increase of the PMo : POC ratio extended beyond the first spring bloom maximum, with values passing from 15 to 59 μmol mol À1 over the 2-19 May period. According to Dellwig et al. (2007), such an increase of PMo concentrations in coastal oxic waters, which is reinforced during the breakdown of an algae bloom, could be related to the formation of aggregates. These authors also indicate that Mo scavenging by organic matter and/or Mo reduction is promoted in the suboxic interior of aggregates and that leads to a sudden deposition of large amounts of organic matter enriched in Mo at the sediment-water interface.",False,False,True,
686,10.1002/lno.11985,27,True,"This body of evidence strongly suggests a dietary origin of Mo incorporated in shells. The few studies which focused on Mo content in scallop soft tissues highlighted that, by far, the highest concentrations are found in the digestive gland where it could be one order of magnitude higher than in gills (Nørum et al. 2005;Tabouret et al. 2012). A similar distribution of Mo in soft parts was found in our study (Fig. 5A), giving additional strength to the following trophic pathway hypothesis. Indeed, the strongest uptake of metals bound to particulate material is achieved via the digestive gland, whereas gills and mantle are key interfaces for the uptake of dissolved metal ions from water (Marig omez et al. 2002).The first spring phytoplankton bloom developed on winter nutrient stocks and reached its maximum intensity on 05 May 2011. However, phytoplankton was exposed to nutritional stress since the end of April 2011 because of silicate limitation. Such conditions favored exudation of extracellular polymeric substances by diatoms. This led to an increase of diatom stickiness and to the formation of diatom aggregates, which concentration likely reached its maximum in early May. The rapid sedimentation of these large particles immediately affected scallops, as evidenced by a significant shell growth rate reduction in the first week of May 2011 (Supporting Information Fig. S1). During their formation and transfer to the sediment, aggregates likely scavenged DMo, resulting in an increase of the PMo/POC ratio. Aggregate formation continued until the end of the bloom, resulting in a maximum PMo/POC ratio reached 2 weeks after the Chl a maximum. Although aggregates likely clogged scallop gills, thus hampering filtration and affecting shell growth negatively, it is highly probable that some Mo-enriched particles (the smallest ones) entered the digestive tract of the scallops. The maximum Mo concentration in soft tissues and in shells was reached simultaneously on 26-27 May 2011 (i.e., 1 week after the PMo/POC maximum), although it started to increase shortly after the first bloom maximum. This suggests that it took approx. 7-8 d between the entry of Mo in the digestive tract through particle filtration and its incorporation in scallop soft and hard tissues.",False,False,False,
687,10.1002/lno.11985,28,True,"This line of reasoning tallies with one of the hypotheses put forward by Barats et al. (2010), who suggested that Mo : Ca maxima in P. maximus shells were directly influenced by spring changes of environmental conditions at the sediment-water interface, occurring shortly after an intense spring diatom bloom. They related the occurrence of these transient peaks with the extent of silicate depletion in the water column, which lead to the sedimentation of Mo-rich biogenic material at the sediment-water interface. Finally, our results confirm previous work by Tabouret et al. (2012) who worked in controlled experimental conditions with Mo isotope enrichments to explain the appearance of Mo:Ca peaks in P. maximus shells. Their study ruled out the assumption of Mo shell enrichment by the dissolved phase and concluded that these peaks likely had a dietary origin.To conclude, our results suggest that the incorporation of Mo in scallop shells is related to the occurrence of diatom aggregate formation in the water column (Fig. 9).

The overall pattern of the shell Li : Ca time series archived in the studied shells can be described as a relatively flat baseline around 40 μmol mol À1 interrupted with one main transient peak (average maximum value around 160 μmol mol À1 ). Such a pattern is consistent with those retrieved in other studies dealing with bivalve shells, on P. maximus from the Bay of Brest (Thébault and Chauvaud 2013), on Cerastoderma edula from the North Sea (Füllenbach et al. 2015), or on Megapitaria aurantiaca from the Gulf of Panama (Sadatzki et al. 2019). On the other hand, bivalve shells from Arctic settings have a much lower baseline (around 10-15 μmol mol À1 ) and do not display major Li:Ca peaks. This is the case for Arctica islandica in northern Iceland (Thébault et al. 2009b) and for Serripes groenlandicus and Ciliatocardium ciliatum in Svalbard (Vihtakari et al., 2017).In the Bay of Brest, the main Li : Ca peak occurred on 18 June 2011 in shells and on 20 June 2011 in soft tissues (Figs. 4,5). The time lag between these peaks and the first spring bloom is close to 7 weeks, while they occurred approx. 2 weeks after the second phytoplankton bloom. Thébault and Chauvaud (2013) already put forward the possible relationship between diatom blooms and Li incorporation in scallop shells. Indeed, it is known that biogenic opal production (e.g., originating from diatom frustules) is among the main removal processes of lithium from the ocean (Coplen et al., 2002). Therefore, we suggest that, in a way or another, incorporation of Li in scallops could be related to diatom blooms. Surprisingly, although the elemental composition of marine phytoplankton is well known, no information is available in the scientific literature on the lithium content in/on diatom cells. Here, we speculate that, like other minor elements, lithium is a component of diatom frustules. Whether lithium enters scallops through the dissolved phase or via a trophic pathway still needs to be investigated.",False,False,False,
689,10.1002/lno.11985,30,True,"Contrary to molybdenum, lithium soft tissue concentrations were approx. twice as high in the mantle and the gills than in the digestive gland (Fig. 5B). All tissues presented an increase in Li content during the spring bloom period, suggesting that both dissolved Li (via gills and mantle) and particulate Li (via digestive gland) in the water column may be involved. During the first half of May 2011, Li concentration in the digestive gland ranged from 0.6 to 0.9 μg g À1 . These values are remarkably close to those found by Thibon et al. (2021) in digestive glands of P. maximus from the Bay of Biscay (0.8 μg g À1 ). Then, a first increase in Li concentration (up to 1.8 μg g À1 ) occurred on 26 May 2011, that is, 3 weeks after the first spring bloom. It was followed by a second maximum value approx. 2 weeks after the second spring bloom (2.4 μg g À1 on 20 June 2011). As already noticed, these two blooms were almost exclusively composed of diatoms but differed in their Chl a content (approx. 1.5 times higher during the first bloom). In their study on juvenile P. maximus clearance rate, Strohmeier et al. (2009) highlighted that scallops have a nonlinear response to increasing food quantity, with the clearance rate decreasing as Chl a concentration increases (above a threshold around 0.4 μg L À1 ). Therefore, our scallops could have assimilated similar amounts of food during these two spring blooms, explaining why the two peaks in Li concentrations in digestive glands were of comparable amplitude. The 2-3-week offset between diatom blooms and Li concentration maxima could be explained by the time required for a frustule to be dissolved in the digestive tract. If this trophic pathway was responsible alone for the incorporation of Li in shells, then two main Li : Ca peaks would have been encountered in the shells (instead of a single one; Fig. 4B). In addition, gills and mantle are the soft tissues with the highest Li concentration, strongly suggesting that Li also enters scallops through the dissolved pathway (Fig. 9).",False,False,False,
690,10.1002/lno.11985,31,True,"At the end of a bloom, a significant amount of diatoms settles on the seafloor. Residence time of biogenic silica in sediments of the Bay of Brest is on the order of 1 month (Laruelle et al. 2009). The amount of Li exported to the sediment-water interface and then released during frustule dissolution likely depends (1) on the phytoplankton cell concentration during a bloom, and (2) on the surface available on diatom frustule for Li adsorption. Based on this estimate of the biovolume ratio between the first and second spring bloom, and considering that the frustule surface/volume ratio scales by a power of 2/3, it was calculated that the surface available on frustules for Li adsorption was approx. 2.6 times higher during the second bloom than during the first one. Interestingly, the Li concentration in gills and mantle measured 2-3 weeks after the second bloom was approx. 2.5 times higher than those measured 2-3 weeks after the first bloom. This strongly suggests that Li incorporated in gills and mantle originated from frustule dissolution at the sediment-water interface, a process that contributed to the increase in dissolved Li concentration in the neighborhood of scallops (Fig. 9).In coastal ecosystems, diatoms are not only living in the water column but also on the sediment. These epibenthic diatoms are a major component of benthic microproducer communities, referred to as microphytobenthos. Their dynamics was investigated at Lanvéoc in 2011 and differed significantly from the phytoplankton dynamics (Chatterjee et al. 2013). Indeed, the microphytobenthic bloom was triggered by light and its biomass reached the annual maximum in mid-April 2011, as soon as maximum intensities of photosynthetically active radiations were recorded at the sediment-water interface. This 2-month time lag between the microphytobenthos bloom and the Li : Ca peak in scallop shells is greater than the residence time of biogenic silica in sediments (Laruelle et al. 2009). Therefore, although we cannot rule out a possible influence of epibenthic diatoms on the incorporation of Li in shells, it is quite clear that these microproducers cannot explain the mid-June Li : Ca shell peak.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Quantification of the physical and biological factors that influence the spatial structuring of food webs is central to inform effective resource management. We used baseline-corrected stable isotope ratios (δ 13 C and δ 15 N) of 63 invertebrate and fish to investigate food web structure across a continental shelf gradient-the Celtic Sea Shelf in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. Hierarchical clustering on δ 13 C and δ 15 N showed that the shelf food web is characterized by four trophic levels with trophic groups spread across pelagic and benthic trophic pathways. Four biomass-weighted isotopic diversity metrics provided indicators on the status of the system, showing a relatively complex food web with high trophic redundancy at intermediate trophic levels suggesting resilience to disturbances. Two sets of statistical models, at the community scale and for each trophic group, identified five distinct trophic assemblages associated with different chlorophyll a concentrations, water depth, and bottom temperature. A cold, vertically mixed-water assemblage over the outer shelf comprised the largest habitat and most diverse assemblage, highlighting the importance of cold productive conditions in the Celtic Sea. Trophic group model results were used to generate spatial area predictions to compare functioning of groups using isotopic overlap (similarity and nestedness) metrics. Isotopic niche area was larger (spanning two trophic levels) in shallow habitats, but not in habitats underlying high primary production or nutrient-rich water masses, suggesting stronger benthic-pelagic trophic coupling in inner shelf habitats. Results suggest that depth and intensity of pelagic production are major drivers of trophic structure and functioning of Celtic Sea communities.",False,False,False,

Food web structure (i.e., the networks of trophic interactions that occur among species within ecosystems) is a fundamental feature of marine ecosystems as it affects energy transfer across trophic levels and biogeochemical cycles within and across ecosystems (Eddy et al. 2020). Understanding how marine food webs are structured along environmental gradients is essential to predict the response of ecosystems to the effects of global change, including anthropogenic pressures such as fishing on biodiversity. In addition, understanding the drivers of food web structure has been a key question in marine sciences: addressing the relationship between the intensity of primary production, usually inferred by the measurement of chlorophyll a concentration, and the production of biomass at high trophic levels is of prime importance, as mid-and high trophic level species largely enter global fisheries (Petrik et al. 2019). Biological transfer of carbon and other nutrients between the sea surface and deep waters may notably blur the link between pelagic primary production and benthic secondary production (Cresson et al. 2020;van Denderen et al. 2018), through the alteration of organic matter fluxes and organization of trophic niches among co-occurring species (Hayden et al. 2019). Human-induced anthropogenic impacts, such as fishing on benthic environments, can therefore have direct effects on demersal and pelagic systems and coupling strength between these systems (Agnetta et al. 2019).",False,False,False,
701,10.1002/lno.11773,2,True,"Ecosystem models are an important tool to understand the effects of climate change and other anthropogenic activities across all trophic levels. However, they require reliable data inputs on food web linkages and overall food web structure (Seibold et al. 2018). Nitrogen (δ 15 N) and carbon (δ 13 C) stable isotope ratios are now recognized as efficient tracers of trophic fluxes in marine systems. The increase in δ 15 N at each trophic level allows the use of this isotope ratio as a proxy of a consumers' trophic level. In contrast, δ 13 C only slightly increases along the food web, and is thus commonly used to trace the origin of the production supporting the food web. For example, in marine systems globally, benthic food webs, whether relying on macro-or microphytobenthic primary production, or on detrital matter, exhibit higher δ 13 C values than pelagic ones based on the direct integration of phytoplanktonic production (Day et al. 2019;Hayden et al. 2019;Cresson et al. 2020). Combining both δ 15 N and δ 13 C has proven useful for illuminating the ecological structure and the organization of food webs within complex systems (Layman et al. 2012;Trueman et al. 2014;Giraldo et al. 2017). However, as the isotopic ratio of a consumer depends on the isotopic ratio of the production at the base of its food web, a consumer's ratio cannot be interpreted without knowledge about the trophic baseline. Addressing accurately the most reliable baseline value, whether with empirical measurements or statistical inferences (Jennings and Warr 2003;Jennings and van der Molen 2015) is one of the most important caveats in isotopic ecology, notably when investigating trophic patterns over large geographical scales. In addition, stable isotope derived metrics (i.e., Isotopic Functional Indices) have been recently demonstrated to be able to capture the trophic diversity and functioning of ecological systems. Under the premise that isotopic niche (the space occupied by organisms in a δ 13 C-δ 15 N space) is a proxy of the trophic niche (e.g., Newsome et al. 2007), and including species biomass as a proxy of their importance (Cucherousset and Villéger 2015), indices can efficiently capture the trophic functioning of the system, notably by providing indicators of trophic redundancy or patchiness (Rigolet et al. 2015).",False,False,False,
702,10.1002/lno.11773,3,True,"The Celtic Sea Shelf located in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean supports some of the largest and most important demersal and pelagic trawl fisheries in the region (Mateo et al. 2017;Moore et al. 2019). The shelf has undergone recent declines in the abundance of the large cold-water species (Atlantic cod Gadus morhua) in the area and an increase of small, noncommercial pelagic species (such as the boarfish Capros aper) has been documented in the area and elsewhere in the Northeast Atlantic (Pinnegar et al. 2002;Blanchard and Vandermeirsch 2005;McLean et al. 2019). To date, research into the Celtic Sea food web has predominantly focused on the trophic ecology of the fish community-demersal, benthic, and pelagic assemblages important in terms of biomass and fisheries in the Celtic Sea (Martinez et al. 2013) on the upper continental slope (Kopp et al. 2018), and along the shelf-wide gradient (Pinnegar et al. 2003;Rault et al. 2017;Day et al. 2019).

For that purpose, we identified relationships between δ 13 C and δ 15 N baseline values and the environment to produce reliable estimates of trophic baseline and associated uncertainty to support robust comparisons of consumer trophic ecology across the shelf. Invertebrates (benthic macrofauna, zooplankton, and cephalopods) and fishes spanning a large trophic range from sites sampled across the spatial domain of the Celtic Sea were then used to assess spatial trends in δ 13 C and δ 15 N of organisms at higher trophic levels within the food web. The specific aims were to: (i) Characterize the food web structure at the scale of the whole sampling area (hereafter referred to as community scale) using a combination of hierarchical cluster analysis and four biomass-weighted isotopic diversity metrics (isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness; Cucherousset and Villéger 2015), (ii) identify biological and physical variables driving the trophic groups and the wider trophic network structure using two sets of statistical models, one set at the community scale and the other for each trophic group, to highlight the spatial structure of the food web, and (iii) compare functioning of trophic groups based on spatial areas identified using isotopic overlap (similarity and nestedness) metrics to identify underlying species assembly processes at different spatial scales.",False,False,False,

## Sample collection
Samples were obtained during the EValuation Halieutique Ouest de l'Europe (EVHOE) surveys in November 2014, 2015, and 2016(Duhamel et al. 2014;Leaute et al. 2015Leaute et al. , 2016) ) as part of the International Bottom Trawl Surveys in the Celtic Sea (ICES 2015). A total of 975 samples of large epifaunal invertebrates (bivalve mollusks and decapod crustaceans), zooplankton (copepods), fish and cephalopod species corresponding to 63 species were collected and analyzed from water depths 57-306 m. Sample size varied between taxa (from 5 to 52), with an average of 15 individuals sampled per species (Table 1). Invertebrates and fish species were obtained by deploying a Grande Ouverture Verticale (GOV) demersal trawl with a cod-end of 20 mm stretched mesh, towed for 30 min at a speed of approximately 3.5 knots by R/V ""Thalassa."" As bottom trawls mostly target fish and cephalopods, the number of benthic invertebrates caught was small relative to total biomass of this fraction in the environment. Such observations are nonetheless particularly relevant as they represent the epi-benthic macrofauna-an important component at the base of the food web (Vaz et al. 2019). Copepods were sampled (November 2014) using a WP2 zooplankton net (Spartel, UK) with a 200 μm mesh size, towed (diagonally) at a speed of 0.75 m s -1 from the surface to 3 m above the seabed.

Fish were measured for total length (cm) and a sample of white dorsal muscle tissue was dissected. For invertebrates, sample processing varied according to taxon. A tissue sample was taken from the muscle of crustaceans, from the abductor muscle of bivalve mollusks, and from the mantle of cephalopods.Copepods were prepared whole. After dissection, all samples were washed in distilled water to prevent contamination by sediment carbonates, dried for 48 h at 60 C and homogenized into a powder using a mixer mill (Model MM400, Retsch, Germany). Carbon ( 13 C/ 12 C, δ 13 C) and nitrogen ( 15 N/ 14 N, δ 15 N) stable isotope composition, and % content of C and N of the powdered samples was determined using a Carlo Erba NC2500 Elemental Analyzer by the Stable Isotopes in Nature Laboratory (SINLAB, University of New Brunswick, Canada). Data were corrected using three reference samples of SINLAB standards (bass muscle, bovine liver and nicotinamide; SD < 0.2‰ for δ 13 C and < 0.1‰ for δ 15 N). Reference materials were previously calibrated against interlaboratory comparison standards distributed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Four variables were analyzed as possible explanatory variables of trophic variability across the Celtic Sea: chlorophyll a concentration, bottom temperature, water depth and seabed substrate (Fig. 1).

711,10.1002/lno.11773,12,True,"## Data analysis Characterization of food web and trophic groups of species
In order to characterize the food web structure, hierarchical clustering (via Euclidean distances and the Ward method) was used to distinguish clusters of species according to their δ 13 C and δ 15 N values, which is a commonly used approach for this type of data (e.g., Kopp et al. 2015). To account for withinsample variation in isotopic values, hierarchical clustering was performed on a bootstrapped matrix of distances between species, implemented via the R package vegan version 2.5-6 (Oksanen et al. 2019). Since the minimum sample size was 5, five individuals per species were randomly sampled via the Simple Random Sampling With Replacement method. The isotopic data of these samples were then used to generate Euclidean distance matrices between species using 500 iterations. The resulting distance matrices were averaged to obtain the bootstrapped distance on which clustering was performed. The optimal number of clusters was assessed by visual inspection of the resulting dendrogram (see Supporting Information Fig. S2) and confirmed using graphs of fusion level (Borcard et al. 2018). Analysis of Similarities (ANOSIM) was used to determine whether clusters were significantly different. Trophic increases of +1‰ in δ 13 C and +4.5‰ in δ 15 N and of +2‰ in δ 13 C and +2.5‰ in δ 15 N were used to show the ranges of isotopic ratios expected for trophic transfer of pelagic and benthic organic matter, respectively (Darnaude et al. 2004). The isotopic ratios of a pelagic primary consumer (copepods) and of a benthic primary consumer (P. maximus) were used as a starting point of the range for the pelagic and benthic trophic pathway, respectively. All mean values are presented with standard deviation unless stated otherwise. The characterization of taxa (benthic, demersal, or pelagic) and the naming of resulting trophic groups were made based on scientific literature analysis of their feeding habits (preference for northern Europe studies), site (coastal zones not including estuaries), substrate (soft bottom), species size (considering ontogenetic shifts in diet), and season (autumn).

712,10.1002/lno.11773,13,True,"## Quantifying isotopic diversity metrics for the food web
Four isotopic diversity metrics (isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness) were used to examine trophic structure in the Celtic Sea (see Cucherousset and Villéger 2015 and references therein for specific details on these metrics including equations for calculations): (a) Isotopic divergence indicates the degree to which species distribution in the isotopic space maximizes the trophic divergence within the food web. Low isotopic divergence (i.e., tends to 0) indicates that relative biomasses are dominated by more generalist species  (i.e., species closer to the center of gravity of the convex hull). Conversely, high isotopic divergence (i.e., tends to 1) indicates that species with the highest biomass occupy the isotopic space more densely on the edges of the convex hull, revealing a trophic specialization and thus a high degree of niche differentiation in the food web. (b) Isotopic dispersion indicates the average trophic diversity in the food web. Isotopic dispersion equals 0 when all species have the same isotope values and increases to 1 when most of the points (or their weight) are far from the center of gravity of the group of points. (c) Isotopic evenness indicates the regularity in species distribution and the density in species packing in the occupied isotopic space. Low isotopic evenness index (i.e., tends to 0) indicates that the food web is composed of clusters of species and implies trophic redundancy and competition for food. In contrast, high isotopic evenness (i.e., tends to 1) indicates that species and relative biomasses are evenly distributed in the isotope space, resulting in higher functional regularity and allowing optimal resource use through niche partitioning (Rigolet et al. 2015). (d) Isotopic uniqueness is defined as the inverse of the average isotopic redundancy (i.e., the average closeness of species in the isotope space). Isotopic uniqueness equals 0 when each species has at least one species with the same position in the isotope space (i.e., clustering of species with similar diets) and tends to 1 when most species (or species with the highest biomass) are isolated in the isotope space.",False,False,False,

Biomass indices are also required. They are based on species collected during the EVHOE surveys. Biomass indices for each species at each station were raised (based on a depth zonation stratification) to the spatial domain of the Celtic Sea. Copepod sampling was insufficient to produce reliable biomass estimates and were subsequently precluded from all further analyses.

As relationships with biological and physical variables were not expected to be linear, we used generalized additive models (GAMs), with a Gaussian distribution and identity link function, implemented via the R package mgcv version 1.8-31 (Wood 2017). To assess isotopic space in relation to the biophysical environment, we fitted community scaleand trophic group-specific GAMs separately on δ 13 C and δ 15 N data. Predictor variables were scaled and centered to account for the different scales of measurement, and all models included a spatial autocorrelation structure to account for the spatial dependence in the data. Model selection was determined by manually running different combinations of covariates in a stepwise process beginning with a model fitted for each of the covariates separately (in addition to the spatial auto-correlation term). The top model of this set of single term models was selected based on Akaike's Information Criterion (AICc) for small sample sizes (Burnham and Anderson 2002). A set of two-term models was then run, including this top model plus each of the remaining three variables. If the top two-term model resulted in improved performance in terms of AICc (ΔAICc) and percent deviance explained (Δ% dev), a set of threeterm models was then run, and so on up to the four variables.

To better infer the spatial effect of environmental conditions on the functioning of trophic groups, two isotopic overlap metrics (isotopic similarity and isotopic nestedness; Cucherousset and Villéger 2015 and references therein) were used to compare the position and size of the isotopic niche among trophic groups associated with key predictor variables across the Celtic Sea. The degree of isotopic overlap was quantified based on spatial areas identified from trophic group models. For selected trophic groups, we first extracted the δ 13 C and δ 15 N data for each species at each station across the spatial areas identified to create trophic groups per spatial area. Biomass indices for each species at each station were raised to the spatial area surface (instead of the whole shelf domain) to create species biomass indices per spatial area. Isotopic overlap metrics were quantified using the total convex hull areas of two groups and the volume of isotopic space they shared (i.e., volume of their intersection). Isotopic similarity equals 0 when the two groups of organisms fill totally different parts of the stable isotope space and increases to 1 when they fill the same portion of the stable isotope space. Isotopic nestedness equals 0 when there is no isotopic overlap and increases to 1 when the group with the smallest convex hull fills a subset of the isotopic space filled by the group with the largest convex hull.",False,False,False,

724,10.1002/lno.11773,25,True,"## Overlap indices of trophic groups in relation to the environment
Overall, two of the strongest biophysical influences associated with trophic group structure were chlorophyll a and depth; both δ 13 C and δ 15 N were generally predicted to be higher in shallow areas (< 80 m depth) of chlorophyll a higher than 0.6 mg m -3 . To explore underlying species assembly processes at different spatial scales, we compared two spatial areas representing low and high chlorophyll a conditions and shallow and deep waters. The spatial comparison was performed for four trophic groups with enough data (Fig. 6). Chlorophyll a concentrations had little structuring effect on isotopic niche space among group 4, but was important for pelagic and demersal fish and cephalopods (group 6) and for demersal predatory fish in group 7 (Fig. 6a-c). Group 4 had similar isotope niche area in high (> 0.6 mg m -3 ) and low (< 0.6 mg m -3 ) chlorophyll a areas. The degree of isotopic overlap (similarity and nestedness) between areas was much larger in group 4 compared to group 7 (Fig. 6a,c). The responses of these metrics are interpretable on the δ 13 C axis, which corresponds to changes in primary producers isotopic compositions supporting the food web. For group 4, there was significant overlap on the δ 13 C axis between areas for the cephalopod Sepiola sp., mackerel (S. scombrus), and sardine (Sardina pilchardus, Fig. 6a). For group 7, isotopic overlap metrics were likely influenced by whiting (M. merlangus) which occupied a different part of the isotopic space on both δ 13 C and δ 15 N axis in low compared to high chlorophyll a conditions (Fig. 6c). The structure of trophic group 6 was altered in high chlorophyll a compared to low chlorophyll a areas, with an absence of overlap on both δ 13 C and δ 15 N axis, but the size of niche space did not vary between areas (Fig. 6b). Change in trophic structure with chlorophyll a conditions was largely influenced by poor cod (T. minutus), red gurnard (Chelidonichthys cuculus), argentine (Argentina sphyraena), European common squid (Alloteuthis sp.), and horse mackerel (T. trachurus) which showed the highest degree Fig 6 .

Accordingly, distance between the species points was greater in shallow compared to deeper waters indicating lower trophic redundancy (i.e., higher Isotopic Uniqueness) among species (Fig. 6d; Table S2).

Food web structure in the Celtic Sea
The Celtic Sea food web is characterized by four trophic levels and two energy pathways based on different carbon sources (primary producer and detrital-based), suggesting a classical community-structure for a temperate coastal ecosystem (Davenport and Bax 2002;le Loc'h et al. 2008;Kopp et al. 2015). The four trophic levels, from primary consumers (trophic level 2) to the top fish predator (Atlantic cod, G. morhua, trophic level 4.4), agrees with previous estimates in the Celtic Sea (Pinnegar et al. 2002), and were comparable to food chain lengths reported from other Northeast Atlantic temperate marine ecosystems (le Loc'h et al. 2008;Kopp et al. 2015;Silberberger et al. 2018) and more widely (Vander Zanden and Fetzer 2007). The range of carbon sources used by primary consumers sampled in the present study is consistent with previously reported ranges for zooplankton (namely copepods) and bivalve mollusks (P. maximus) from other Northeast Atlantic coastal waters, including in the Bay of Biscay (le Loc'h et al. 2008) and English Channel (Kopp et al. 2015). Due to bacterial remineralization, benthic ecosystem components are often enriched in the heavy isotopes of carbon (and sometimes nitrogen) compared to fresh, pelagic production. Thus, zooplankton feeding directly on particulate organic matter (POM) are relatively depleted in 13 C compared to filter-feeding bivalve mollusks.",False,False,False,
727,10.1002/lno.11773,28,True,"Our results, related to the sampling gear used (demersal trawl GOV), showed that the Celtic Sea is characterized by a particularly high abundance of small fish feeding on zooplankton and hyperbenthos known for their vertical migrations and pelagic or demersal predatory fish feeding on small fish and crustaceans. This demonstrates that a substantial proportion of biomass at mid-trophic levels, and by inference production, in the Celtic Sea is supported by production channeled through the pelagic pathway, ultimately fueling large demersal fish at the top of the food web. Besides this, the benthic pathway can be discerned from less depleted 13 C compositions of benthic and demersal fish feeding on benthic invertebrates at a low trophic level, to crustacean decapods (e.g., brachyura and anomura) at a higher trophic level. The relatively low biomass of benthic-compared to pelagicfeeding fishes suggests that this pathway is less structuring than the pelagic one. It must be acknowledged however, that inferences about the emerging patterns within and across energy pathways are tentative as the biomasses of benthic organisms may have been underestimated due to the sampling gear used in this study. Including all components of an ecosystem (i.e., benthic and pelagic invertebrates, and at least fish), whether through the direct collection of all groups or the development of accurate proxies (e.g., Day et al. 2020), is a major topic in current research, particularly in the context of integrated management of marine systems (Seibold et al. 2018). Nevertheless, in these waters benthic ecosystem components are more or less directly coupled to pelagic primary production, as observed for neighboring environments with similar depths, i.e., the North Sea (Duffill Telsnig et al. 2019) or the Bay of Biscay (Lassalle et al. 2011;Cresson et al. 2020). Feeding plasticity of benthic organisms allows them to position themselves on the pelagic pathway. For instance, a recent isotopic investigation showed suspended POM made up 47% of the diet of the Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus (da Silva Santana et al. 2020). In addition, diel vertically migrating prey (calanoid copepods, euphausiids, mysids, fishes) are also likely to play a significant role in the transfer of pelagic production to benthic ecosystem components in this shallow shelf sea environment. More generally, as benthic consumers exhibit a large trophic plasticity, and largely rely on detritus, they are classically considered as the ultimate opportunists. Their trophic features, such as isotopic ratios, can be viewed as proxies of the predominant source of organic matter in the system (Cresson et al. 2020).",False,False,False,
728,10.1002/lno.11773,29,True,"In the Celtic Sea, previous studies also demonstrated the importance of pelagic production to fuel fish assemblages, even at mid-water depths (Trueman et al. 2014). Comparison with results obtained from both empirical data and model outputs on neighboring ecosystems highlight the importance of depth as a major factor driving the degree of connectivity between pelagic and benthic systems (i.e., weakening of the pelagic-benthic coupling from coastal to offshore areas) and the stronger oceanic influence for the Celtic Sea. In the shallow English Channel, the food web is marked by stronger benthic pathways (Kopp et al. 2015;Giraldo et al. 2017). On the contrary, the contribution of pelagic production is predominant in the deeper (~140 m depth) Bay of Biscay (Lassalle et al. 2011;Cresson et al. 2020). The apparent gaps in niche space between P. maximus and the group of ""demersal/benthic fish, demersal cephalopods and macrobenthos carnivores"" (Fig. 2) would have been partially filled by isotopic compositions of their prey (decapod crustaceans, mysids, polychaetes, echinoderms and gastropod mollusks) had we been able to obtain sufficient sample sizes and biomass data for this suite of small invertebrates in this food web.",False,False,False,
729,10.1002/lno.11773,30,True,"Our results showed that isotopic functional diversity indices mainly differentiate the generalist consumers from zooplankton consumers, revealing a trophic specialization. The isotopic divergence index indicates a high degree of niche differentiation within the food web. Noticeably, it is in agreement with the mosaic of different seabed habitats that provide complex microhabitat structures for epibenthic assemblages in the Celtic Sea (Ellis et al. 2013). This suggests that the habitat is responsible for the differences in diet width between consumers (probably with lower prey diversity in the pelagic habitat). Trophic specialization occurs more often in predator populations regulated by resources (Estes et al. 2011), and may include the coupling of food resources that are also compartmentalized in space (McCann et al. 2005). For example, in an oligotrophic lake system, the use of distinct habitats in a generalist freshwater predator (Eurasian perch Perca fluviatilis) led to intrapopulation niche partitioning between pelagic and littoral subpopulations (Quevedo et al. 2009). In addition to the results obtained for isotopic divergence, low isotopic evenness and uniqueness values showed that the food web is composed of clusters of species, revealing more dietary overlap and thus more competition for the same resource at intermediate trophic levels. Ashton et al. (2010) found the existence of plasticity in resource use among dominant species provides a mechanism by which species with broadly overlapping resource use might coexist. In the Celtic Sea ecosystem, higher specialization among generalist species feeding in different microhabitats may therefore provide opportunities to maximize resource use (i.e., niche complementarity) and thus augment productivity. Indeed, Day et al. (2019) found distinct feeding niches and strategies within four dominant predatory fishes, which effectively limit interspecific competition in the area. Consistent with the results obtained for the other metrics, low isotopic dispersion showed average trophic diversity in the food web is low due to substantial reductions in the abundance of top predator fish due to intense fishing in the area, which has cascaded into an increased abundance of small, pelagic and demersal fishes feeding lower in the food web over time (Pinnegar et al. 2002;Hernvann and Gascuel 2020).",False,False,False,
730,10.1002/lno.11773,31,True,"It is predicted that more complex food webs will be more resilient to environmental changes due to greater trophic redundancy that can buffer against species loss (Sanders et al. 2018). The high trophic redundancy at intermediate trophic levels reported here probably offers great resistance to disturbances (Walters and Post 2008). In the Celtic Sea, relations between taxa and the environment have remained stable over the past two decades (Mérillet et al. 2019), perhaps due to this high trophic redundancy in the system or the fact that the ecosystem has been shaped by fishing for such a long period of time now and therefore has adapted to an overall stable state. However, with ongoing climate change, increased bottom temperature in the area is likely to substantially alter the distribution of taxa in the coming years, especially coldwater taxa (Mérillet et al. 2019). This in turn may lead to a decrease in prey diversity and thus energy transfer within the ecosystem, and consequently on the food availability for higher trophic levels. While all facets of isotopic diversity are important indicators of the functioning of ecological systems, isotopic divergence, evenness and uniqueness indices may be most informative when investigating the degree of habitat coupling mediated by predators (McCann et al. 2005), particularly in ecologically complex food webs.",False,False,False,
731,10.1002/lno.11773,32,True,"## Biological and physical drivers of trophic variability
Knowing which biophysical variables drive changes in the main functional components is key to understanding variability in food web structure in the Celtic Sea. Studies of fish and invertebrate abundance and species distributions recognized that depth, chlorophyll a concentrations and bottom temperature influence assemblages of demersal communities in the Celtic Sea alongside changes in fisheries pressures (Mérillet et al. 2019), while bathymetry, bottom temperature and salinity were found to be the main drivers structuring planktonic assemblages (Haberlin et al. 2019). Fluctuations in the strength and properties of these processes may therefore have a major impact on the stability of the functional composition and spatial organization of the food web.",False,False,False,
732,10.1002/lno.11773,33,True,"In this study, we demonstrated that in the Celtic Sea, chlorophyll a concentrations were strongly associated with higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values at moderate levels of chlorophyll a (> 0.6 and < 0.8 mg m -3 ) congruent with colder bottom temperatures (< 10 C), and with higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values at the highest chlorophyll a levels (> 1.0 mg m -3 ) in areas with warmer bottom temperatures (> 11.5 C) and shallower bathymetry (< 80 m depth). Chlorophyll a concentrations decrease rapidly from inner shelf areas on the shelf, and the seasonal cycle of primary production is tightly coupled to the change in vertical water column structure (Wihsgott et al. 2019). In coastal waters, as opposed to offshore areas where the δ 13 C and δ 15 N baseline may be relatively stable (Jennings and Warr 2003;MacKenzie et al. 2014), there are greater temporal variations in bottom temperature and salinity, which has been shown to alter δ 13 C and δ 15 N values at the base of the food web, ultimately affecting consumer isotope values (Jennings and van der Molen 2015). These results therefore point to consistent zonal differences in δ 13 C and δ 15 N values along oligotrophic-to-eutrophic gradients in the Celtic Sea (Marañ on et al. 2005), previously observed in oceanic upwelling areas and on continental shelves (e.g., Radabaugh et al. 2013). Correlations between δ 13 C and δ 15 N and surface concentrations of chlorophyll a may be higher over the outer shelf due to resupply of inorganic nutrients from the dark, nutrient-rich bottom waters to the nutrient-depleted surface waters (Wihsgott et al. 2019). Higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values may also be linked to intrusions from the Bristol Channel, Severn Estuary, and the English Channel, which are carried along the inner shelf by wind-driven coastal currents reinforced by density-driven currents associated with seasonal fronts (Uncles 2010). Higher isotopic ratios measured in higher productive conditions may also be linked with increase of downward exports of pelagic production. For example, Ying et al. (2020) recently observed an unexpected mismatch between pelagic production and pelagic contribution. When the production of the pelagic system was low, it contributed substantially to both benthic and pelagic systems, but with low biomass for all functional groups, and high trophic overlap between them. On the contrary, when pelagic production increased, its contribution to benthic groups decreased, along with lower overlap and higher biomasses of benthic fish and crustaceans. This unexpected pattern may be related to increased downward fluxes, that increase benthic secondary production and/or bacterial alteration of organic matter, and an increased importance of the benthic pathway in the whole system that contributes to increased isotopic ratios (Griffiths et al. 2017).",False,False,False,
733,10.1002/lno.11773,34,True,"The community scale pattern of spatial trends in δ 13 C and δ 15 N values is remarkably consistent among trophic groups. This consistency suggests that spatially explicit trends are conserved from the base of the food web into the upper trophic levels. It may suggest that large predatory fishes move only a limited amount in the region as residency of predators and prey is required for spatial trends in isotope values to propagate up the food web (Graham et al. 2010). Five distinct trophic assemblages occur within the Celtic Sea, associated with different chlorophyll a concentrations, water depth and bottom temperature: (1) a cold, vertically mixed-water assemblage over the outer shelf characterized by moderate chlorophyll a (0.6-0.8 mg m -3 ). This habitat was the largest and hosts the most diverse assemblage. This is consistent with the findings of Ellis et al. (2013) who found the outer shelf epibenthic assemblage to be the most speciose in the region. Scallops (P. maximus) were strongly associated with colder bottom temperatures in the area (< 10 C). While seabed habitat (mud to muddy sand) was the strongest predictor for the group of ""demersal/benthic fish, demersal cephalopods and macrobenthos carnivores"", which hosted taxa including Norway lobster that are known to predominantly occur in the area (Ellis et al. 2013). This highlights the importance of cold productive environmental conditions in the Celtic Sea (Mérillet et al. 2019), where the availability of optimal prey for predators may lead to higher dietary specialization and stronger habitat coupling (McCann et al. 2005). ( 2) An oceanic assemblage over the northern shelf edge, characterized by low chlorophyll a (< 0.45 mg m -3 ) and deeper depths (~160 m). This habitat comprises a greater diversity of oceanic and neritic taxa, which adds to previous studies in explaining the spatial heterogeneity in taxa distribution in the Celtic Sea (Dolder et al. 2018;Mérillet et al. 2019). (3) A warmer mixed-water assemblage in the southern part of the shelf characterized by deeper depths (> 150 m). Species in this habitat are the most widely distributed across habitats (i.e., northern shelf edge, outer shelf and southern part) in the Celtic Sea. This also highlights the increase in diversity and biomass of taxa in warmer waters in the Celtic Sea. In regions where the fronts separate a warm stratified offshore region from a tidally mixed cooler inshore region, Haberlin et al. (2019) observed a greater gelatinous zooplankton diversity and biomass in the warm water community. Two habitats comprised benthic taxa, which were strongly influenced by depth: (4) a warm, shallow mixed-water assemblage over the northeast inner shelf, and (5) a colder mixed-water assemblage over the central part of the study area contiguous with the Jones Bank, and the shelf edge characterized by deeper waters (> 150 m). The inner shelf assemblage was also strongly associated with coarse sediments and mixed substrate in the area highlighting the importance of these fine-scale, fragmented seabed habitats in generating spatial heterogeneity and structurally complex microhabitats within the ecosystem.",False,False,False,

This difference may be related to pelagic species that are not plastic, i.e., always belonging to a pelagic-based pathway whatever the level of pelagic production, potentially driven by upward fluxes of matter. In contrast, benthic species are more plastic, whether in their diet, or in the source of matter fueling the benthic pathway. As observed in other systems (Hayden et al. 2019;Ying et al. 2020), increased pelagic production increases downward fluxes, and stimulates benthic production and bacterial activity. In this study, the major niche shift observed for opportunist benthic groups could thus testify to the increased importance of benthic production at two trophic levels.",False,False,False,

Isotopic niche area was larger (spanning two trophic levels) in shallow habitats, but not in habitats underlying high primary production or nutrient-rich water masses, suggesting stronger benthic-pelagic trophic coupling in inner shelf habitats. In nearshore habitats where water depth is relatively shallow (< 80 m depth), the daytime thickness of the vertically migrating community is compressed into a shallow layer. This means that pelagic sources are potentially more accessible to benthic consumers, and reciprocally, benthic species more accessible to pelagic consumers, resulting in complex systems with multiple interactions as previously documented in coastal shelf studies (Kopp et al. 2015;Giraldo et al. 2017). In deeper habitats (> 80 m depth), niche area was much smaller due to the reduction in food sources in less diverse pelagic environments, as expected. We also found a marked difference in the diversity of taxa between shallow and deep water habitats, with the former tending to have a greater diversity of more coastal species that were characteristic of inshore waters. Decreasing variability of isotopic ratios with depth was previously found in fish and invertebrates in the eastern English Channel (Kopp et al. 2015). In this study, decreasing variability of isotopic ratios from shallow to deeper habitats was associated with changes in hydrodynamics and seabed habitats, as well as to changes in the availability of benthic prey/resources. The results are consistent with the findings of Day et al. (2019) who observed a decrease in diet spectra of demersal fish predators from shallow to deeper depths in the Celtic Sea.

This study significantly advances our understanding of the drivers of trophic structure and functioning of communities in the Celtic Sea, a large productive shelf ecosystem that supports important fisheries in the region (Mateo et al. 2017;Moore et al. 2019). Prior to this study, no information has been available on the overall structure of the food web in relation to the biophysical environment, yet understanding of the underlying processes structuring trophic assemblages and the wider Celtic Sea ecosystem is central to inform effective resource management. Our results show that the Celtic Sea food web forms a continuum of four trophic levels with trophic groups spread across two trophic pathways based on pelagic (primary producer based) and benthic (detrital-based) systems. Four biomass-weighted isotopic diversity indices (isotopic divergence, dispersion, evenness, and uniqueness) provided indicators on the status of the system, showing a relatively complex food web with high trophic redundancy at intermediate trophic levels suggesting resilience to disturbances. Five distinct trophic assemblages were found in the Celtic Sea associated with different environmental conditions, suggesting that depth and intensity of pelagic production are major drivers of trophic structure and functioning of communities and requires further investigation. This research also highlights the importance of cold productive conditions in the Celtic Sea and adds to previous studies in explaining the spatial heterogeneity in taxa distribution on the shelf, e.g., fish (Dolder et al. 2018;Mérillet et al. 2019), zooplankton (Haberlin et al. 2019), and epibenthic community assemblages (Ellis et al. 2013). The structuring effect of depth on isotopic niche size in benthic functional groups highlights the necessity to identify underlying species assembly processes at different spatial scales to inform effective resource management.### Untitled Figure

## Abstract
Interactions between riverine inputs, internal cycling, and oceanic exchange result in dynamic variations in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) in large estuaries. Here, we report the first bay-wide, annual-scale observations of surface pCO 2 and air-water CO 2 flux along the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay, revealing large annual variations in pCO 2 (43-3408 μatm) and a spatial-dependence of pCO 2 on internal and external drivers. The low salinity upper bay was a net source of CO 2 to the atmosphere (31.2 mmol m -2 d -1 ) supported by inputs of CO 2 -rich Susquehanna River water and the respiration of allochthonous organic matter, but part of this region was also characterized by low pCO 2 during spring and fall phytoplankton blooms. pCO 2 decreased downstream due to CO 2 ventilation supported by long water residence times, stratification, mixing with low pCO 2 water masses, and carbon removal by biological uptake. The mesohaline middle bay was a net CO 2 sink (-5.8 mmol m -2 d -1 ) and the polyhaline lower bay was nearly in equilibrium with the atmosphere (1.0 mmol m -2 d -1 ). Although the main stem of the bay was a weak CO 2 source (3.7 AE 3.3 × 10 9 mol C) during the dry hydrologic (calendar) year 2016, our observations showed higher river discharge could decrease CO 2 efflux. In contrast to many other estuaries worldwide that are strong sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere, the Chesapeake Bay and potentially other large estuaries are very weak CO 2 sources in dry years, and could even turn into a CO 2 sink in wet years.",False,False,False,
744,10.1002/lno.11573,1,True,"## Untitled Section
Estuaries are important sites for understanding carbon cycling, due to their disproportionate contribution to airwater CO 2 fluxes. With only 0.3% of the global ocean surface area, estuaries release about 0.1-0.25 Pg C y -1 into the atmosphere, counterbalancing about 17% of the CO 2 uptake of the open oceans (Cai 2011;Chen et al. 2013). However, estimates of estuarine CO 2 flux still have large uncertainties due to a paucity of data coverage (e.g., limited research for low-latitude estuaries (Borges 2005) and in large estuaries and bay systems in the US mid-Atlantic coast (Joesoef et al. 2015)), as well as poor spatial and temporal coverage. Moreover, there are large uncertainties in estimating CO 2 flux through calculated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) when including discrete alkalinity observations, especially in low salinity waters, because of organic alkalinity and uncertainties in carbonic acid dissociation constants. Additionally, estuarine CO 2 fluxes exhibit high spatial heterogeneity as well as diurnal and seasonal variability. This variability tends to be the major source of bias in conclusions drawn from sporadic observations. To better understand the contribution of estuaries to the global carbon cycle, frequent and long-term field investigations with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage and studies across estuarine types are clearly needed.",False,False,False,
745,10.1002/lno.11573,2,True,"Estuaries receive large amounts of dissolved and particulate carbon from rivers, which undergo significant transformation before being transferred to the adjacent coastal seas. These complex biogeochemical processes determine the magnitude and direction of air-water CO 2 flux. Most estuaries are characterized by oversaturated surface pCO 2 (Chen and Borges 2009;Cai 2011) from degraded allochthonous organic matter, with community respiration exceeding gross primary production. Indeed, most estuaries are net heterotrophic and net sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere (Gattuso et al. 1998;Battin et al. 2008). However, other factors, including calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) formation/dissolution, exchange of water inputs from adjacent aquatic systems with different pCO 2 signals, water residence time, and stratification can modulate air-water CO 2 flux and even drive the system to absorb CO 2 from the atmosphere (Borges et al. 2006). In particular, permanent or seasonal water stratification plays an important role in modifying surface pCO 2 by decoupling organic matter production in surface waters from respiration below the pycnocline, where respired CO 2 does not readily exchange with the atmosphere. The result is that production in surface waters decreases pCO 2 and can drive the surface mixed layer to be a CO 2 sink, despite generating a subsurface large respiration signal (Kone et al. 2009). Estuary size and type also influence the CO 2 flux. Smaller estuaries show more significant heterotrophy than larger estuaries (Caffrey 2004). Large riverdominated estuaries and their plumes have been extensively studied (e.g., Amazon River (Cooley et al. 2007), Mississippi River (Huang et al. 2015), and Changjiang River (Zhai et al. 2007)), however, few studies have been conducted in large bays with moderate river input and a long water residence time. Limited recent research has shown that pCO 2 values in these ocean-dominated, large estuaries are much lower than river-dominated small estuaries (Joesoef et al. 2015;Dinauer and Mucci 2017).",False,False,False,
746,10.1002/lno.11573,3,True,"The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States with a length of about 300 km, a width of 8-48 km, an average depth of 8 m, and a main stem trench up to 50 m (Cerco and Cole 1993). It is a partially mixed and microtidal estuary with two-layer circulation. Spatially, it is characterized by interactions between a river-dominated upper bay and an ocean-dominated lower bay, with a long, average water residence time of 180 d (Du and Shen 2016). The Chesapeake Bay is undergoing increasing pressure from nearby population growth (Orth et al. 2017), and has been characterized by severe long-term eutrophication due to riverine nutrient inputs (Boesch et al. 2001;Kemp et al. 2005). These nutrient inputs stimulate the production of organic matter, which during strong summer stratification sinks below the pycnocline and is respired where ventilation is prevented, resulting in summer hypoxia and anoxia in the deep trench (Officer et al. 1984;Hagy et al. 2004). Although the Chesapeake Bay has received wide research attention, until recently only limited studies on the inorganic carbon dynamics have been conducted, including early research in some tributaries in the lower bay (Wong 1979;Raymond et al. 2000). Recent studies of the CO 2 system include investigations at one upper bay station in summer 2013 (Cai et al. 2017), the bay-wide seasonal and spatial distribution of DIC, TA, and pH (Brodeur et al. 2019), a model simulation of pCO 2 in the bay (Shen et al. 2019), and a study of seasonal mass balance of DIC in the middle and lower bay (Friedman et al. 2020). So far, no comprehensive annual CO 2 flux of the Chesapeake Bay has been reported, nor included in the global estuarine CO 2 flux synthesis (Cai 2011;Chen et al. 2013;Laruelle et al. 2015).

## Study site and cruise information
The Chesapeake Bay was divided into three subregions following the approach in Kemp et al. (1997), including an upper bay (> 39.0 N, 11% of total area), a middle bay (37.9-39.0 N, 36% of total area), and a lower bay (< 37.9 N, 53% of total area) (Fig. 1). We conducted four bay-wide cruises in the Chesapeake Bay on R/V Rachel Carson on 04-06 May, 06-10 June, 08-12 August, and 10-13 October 2016, and one bay-wide cruise on a commercial boat on 21-22 February 2019, hereafter referred to as ""Carson cruises."" In addition, we conducted six cruises on the R/V Randall T. Kerhin on 14-16 March,[12][13][11][12][13][19][20][21][14][15]  and 12-14 December 2016, which are subsequently referred to as ""DNR cruises."" The hydrographic sampling stations in the Carson cruises were mostly selected from the Maryland and Virginia water quality monitoring stations for historical comparison. Both underway monitoring and discrete sampling were conducted spanning from the near-zero salinity estuary of the Susquehanna River to the mouth of the bay, mainly along the central axis. The only exception is that the May Carson cruise only covered the upper, middle, and northernmost part of the lower bay, omitting the rest of the lower bay stations. The DNR cruises included the Maryland portion of the water quality monitoring stations, with the southernmost point reaching the mouth of the Potomac River. No underway monitoring was conducted on the DNR cruises.",False,False,False,

At each station, we collected discrete surface samples (~0.5 m below surface) for dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and pH during all cruises, and sampled dissolved oxygen (DO) as well during the Carson cruises. For the DNR and most of the Carson cruises, we used an in situ profile pumping system equipped with a YSI 6600 (Xylem) to take samples and record in situ temperature and salinity. On the February 2019 Carson cruise, we collected samples from an underway flowthrough system of the boat. Water temperature and salinity were recorded by a thermosalinograph (SBE45, Sea-Bird Scientific) inside an underway partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO 2 ) system (AS-P2, Apollo SciTech) in the onboard lab. The measured temperature was used as the in situ surface water temperature, because surface water was pumped through a short standpipe directly to the lab in seconds and the temperature difference between in situ surface water (~0.5 m, with a NIST traceable thermometer) and the pCO 2 system was negligible (< 0.1 C).",False,False,False,

DIC was analyzed using an automated DIC analyzer (AS-C3, Apollo SciTech), with a precision of 0.1% and an accuracy of AE 2 μmol kg -1 . pH was measured on the NBS scale at 25 C using an Orion ROSS Ultra pH electrode (8102BNUWP, Thermo Scientific) and calibrated against three NBS pH buffers (pH = 4.01, 7.00, and 10.01), with a precision of AE 0.003 pH units. More sampling and measurement details were shown in Brodeur et al. (2019). DO samples were collected in 60 mL BOD bottles and stored in the dark with a water seal to prevent gas exchange, which were spectrophotometrically determined within 48 h by a modified Winkler method (Pai et al. 1993). In addition, we measured underway surface pCO 2 and DO during the Carson cruises using the underway pCO 2 system. Surface pCO 2 was measured approximately every 1.5 min using a shower head type equilibrator. The pCO 2 system was calibrated every 6-12 h against four compressed CO 2 gas standards (150.62, 404.72, 992.54, and 1984.82 ppm CO 2 in air), which are traceable to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) scale. Atmospheric pCO 2 was measured every 3-6 h using the same CO 2 system. The precision of underway pCO 2 measurements is 0.1 μatm and the overall accuracy is estimated at 2 μatm.

We obtained monthly and annual mean wind speed and surface water temperature in the subregions and over the entire bay from the mooring data of the Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (https://buoybay.noaa.gov/observations/  data-download). The eight buoys along the main stem were included to derive these values (Fig. 1). In some months, there was limited buoy data to calculate the monthly average, due to service problems. To address this, we first averaged available monthly data for each buoy and then averaged other buoy data collected in the same subregion. For wind speed, we corrected observed wind speed (3 m) to a 10 m height using the proposed equation in the Shore Protection Manual (1984). For surface temperature, we calculated the seasonal mean surface temperature for the upper, middle, and lower bay and then averaged them to get a bay-wide annual mean surface temperature of 17 AE 0.1 C in 2016.## Susquehanna River end-member properties
We monitored the Susquehanna River end-member temperature, salinity, DIC, and pH values monthly at the Conowingo Dam (USGS site #01578310) in 2016, except in March and April, when we collected samples at the nearby Havre de Grace station. Monthly Chlorophyll a (Chl a) for the Susquehanna River was measured at the river mouth (Sta. CB1.0) by the Chesapeake Bay Program (www.chesapeakebay.net).

752,10.1002/lno.11573,9,True,"## Calculation of pCO 2 in surface mixed layer
Since there was no direct pCO 2 measurement during the DNR cruises, we calculated surface pCO 2 from the discrete surface DIC and pH measurements, using the Excel version of CO2SYS (Pierrot et al. 2006), with carbonic acid dissociation constants K 1 and K 2 from Millero et al. (2006), K HSO4 from Dickson (1990), and total boron from Uppström (1974), according to the recommendations in previous studies (Millero et al. 2006;Orr et al. 2015). We used DIC and pH, rather than TA, to calculate pCO 2 to avoid the uncertainties of calculation associated with organic alkalinity in estuarine waters (Cai et al. 1998), because CO2SYS neglects the contribution of organic alkalinity.To evaluate the difference between calculated and underway measured pCO 2 values, we collected some discrete underway DIC and pH samples in waters with salinity ≥ 5. Underway pCO 2 measurements were systematically higher than calculated values, with mean differences of 33 μatm (n = 3, mean salinity = 5) in the upper bay, 16 μatm (n = 26, mean salinity = 10) in the middle bay, and 15 μatm (n = 31, mean salinity = 16) in the lower bay. These differences in the middle and lower bay are on the same level as in temperate oceans (Wanninkhof et al. 1999). The relatively larger discrepancies in the upper bay are associated with the larger uncertainties of the carbonic acid dissociation constants at low salinities and likely sampling lag among these carbonate parameters in this dynamic environment (~2 min sampling interval for pCO 2 ). Given low salinity river water is limited to a small area of the upper bay, and the discrepancy in pCO 2 was relatively small when compared with riverine pCO 2 of up to 2000 μatm, the discrepancy in calculated pCO 2 only contributes to 0.7% of the CO 2 flux in the upper.

Monthly mean wind speeds at 10 m height used to calculate CO 2 flux were from the Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System buoy data. A positive flux indicates that surface waters are degassing CO 2 into the atmosphere.To get an accurate area-averaged CO 2 flux, we divided the Chesapeake Bay into fine latitudinal segments. Each segment has a width of the main stem of the bay and a north-south resolution of 0.01 . We averaged all CO 2 flux measurements within each segment to get a representative flux, which was multiplied with the segment area to get a CO 2 flux of the segment. The area-averaged CO 2 flux was calculated by normalizing the sum of all CO 2 fluxes to the total areas of segments with data. We then evaluated area-averaged CO 2 fluxes (F A ) for the upper, middle, and lower bay, and the entire bay using Eq. 2
where F x is the average of all CO 2 flux measurements within each segment and A x is the corresponding sectional surface area. The uncertainty of CO 2 flux was estimated from the SD of the means for wind speed and the uncertainty of pCO 2 measurements using error propagation method.",False,False,False,

To study the potential difference in CO 2 flux between dry and wet months, we simply simulated surface pCO 2 variation from late fall to early spring in the lower bay under interactions among air-water gas exchange, surface water temperature change, and biological removal of inorganic carbon from the surface mixed layer. For the lower bay, a simplified simulation is a reasonable approach due to several months water residence time, low surface nutrient concentration, and relatively uniform surface pCO 2 .In the simulation, we used field measurements of carbonate parameters in the lower bay in October 2016 as the initial values, as well as mean atmospheric pCO 2 , wind speed, surface mixed layer depth, biological DIC removal rate in surface mixed layer estimated from Kemp et al. (1997), and surface temperature. During each iterative calculation with a time step of 1 h, we first calculated the air-water CO 2 flux. This amount of CO 2 was added to the DIC inventory in the surface mixed layer, and biological DIC removal was subtracted. Then, we calculated a new surface pCO 2 using this biogeochemically modulated DIC and surface temperature at the time of the next iteration. The newly calculated pCO 2 was used for the next iterative calculation of air-water gas exchange.## Relationship of pCO 2 and DO variations
To explain biological modulation of surface pCO 2 , we adopted the relationship between the high-resolution underway measurements of saturation states of pCO 2 and DO, i.e., pCO 2 % and DO% respectively, with respect to the atmosphere. pCO 2 % and DO% were calculated using Eqs. 3 and 4.where subscript (water) denotes in situ measurements. pCO 2 (air) is cruise-averaged atmospheric pCO 2 (μatm). DO (saturated) is saturated DO concentration (μmol kg -1 ) in surface waters calculated from in situ water temperature and salinity.",False,False,False,

Blooms resulted in large areas of low pCO 2 in the lower portion of the upper bay (August), the upper portion of the middle bay (February and June), and from the middle bay to the mid-reach of the lower bay (October) (Fig. 2). Moreover, blooms also resulted in a lower bay-wide average surface pCO 2 of 468 AE 289 μatm in August than months before and after.Surface pCO 2 and npCO 2 vs. latitude Surface water pCO 2 is plotted against latitude in Fig. 3a (Carson cruises) and Fig. 3b (DNR cruises). Surface pCO 2 normalized to the annual mean surface temperature of 17 C (npCO 2 ) is plotted in the same way in Fig. 3c,d. Given that pCO 2 in water increases by about 4.23% with a 1 C increase in temperature (Takahashi et al. 1993), the annual temperature cycle can increase bay-wide mean surface pCO 2 from 316 μatm in February to 990 μatm in August, accounting for 29% of the annual pCO 2 range. In this sense, large annual variations in water temperature could contribute to pronounced changes in pCO 2 . Given npCO 2 removes the thermal influence on pCO 2 , same npCO 2 over seasons suggests that temperature change dominates pCO 2 variation and the non-thermal processes, including physical mixing, air-water gas exchange, biological production/respiration, and chemical reactions, are weak or their effects counterbalance each other.",False,False,False,

Although the upper bay was supersaturated in pCO 2 at most times, undersaturated pCO 2 with respect to the atmosphere was observed slightly downstream of the Susquehanna River mouth (~39.4 N) in April (Fig. 3b) and May (Fig. 3a) and in the lower-reach of the upper bay in August (~39.2 N) (Fig. 3a). Under the influence of high pCO 2 riverine input (Fig. 3b) and high temperature in summer, there were two seasonal pCO 2 peaks observed in March (3408 μatm) and August (2565 μatm). However, due to the contribution of seasonal biological blooms, regionally average surface pCO 2 was lower in August (782 AE 667 μatm), as well as in April (642 AE 242 μatm) and May (977 AE 315 μatm), than months before and after.

Based on the hydrographic features and pCO 2 variations, we divided the study area into 3 subregions: salinity 0-3, 3-12, and 12-33.

This pattern indicates that Susquehanna River discharge was a major contributor to the large pCO 2 variations in the bay. In the salinity range of 0-3, the most variable pCO 2 values were observed at salinities close to 0, with both undersaturated npCO 2 and pCO 2 observed in April and May and oversaturated values observed in other months (Fig. 4). By comparison, estuarine turbidity maximum centered on average where salinity of 1 isohaline meets the bottom (Boynton et al. 1997). Invariant npCO 2 (~1500 μatm at ~39.4 N) clustered around the center of the estuarine turbidity maximum from May to September, showing that the increasing pCO 2 was dominated by temperature increase.

This suggests a time lag in the response of salinity and pCO 2 to discharge variations. Additionally, the fact that pCO 2 decreased drastically at a similar salinity in some consecutive months might underscore the influence of long water residence times and an interaction between high pCO 2 riverine and low pCO 2 oceanic water masses. The largest vertical pCO 2 gradient observed at a surface salinity of ~17 in September and October suggests that high salinity and CO 2 -rich subsurface water was brought to the surface due to the fall seasonal erosion of stratification.

Controlling mechanisms of spatial and temporal variations in surface pCO 2 Regional dominance of biological production and respiration Estuaries are characterized by a large range of pCO 2 which is related to net CO 2 inputs from external and internal sources, seasonal temperature change, air-water gas exchange, and the metabolic state of the system. To explain biological modulation of surface pCO 2, field observations of pCO 2 % and DO% are shown in Fig. 5 with each plot being divided into four quadrants. Quadrants I and III represent heating and cooling, respectively. Quadrants II and IV indicate biological respiration and production, respectively. Here, we focus on comparing production and respiration.Net respiration and production determine the regional and seasonal characteristics and levels of surface pCO 2 (Figs. 3, 5). High biological respiration sustains the oversaturated pCO 2 in the upper bay demonstrated by undersaturated DO (quadrant II) from May to October. Notably, respiration was the only dominant metabolic state in May and October, while production was also observed in June and August. Moderate net respiration and production sustain the oversaturated and undersaturated pCO 2 in the upper-reach and lower-reach of the middle bay, respectively, from May to August. The boundary between the two subsections is near 38.5 N (Fig. 3), or at a surface salinity of about 12 (Fig. 4). However, net respiration dominantly determines the middle bay oversaturated pCO 2 in September and October. The lower bay had a nearly balanced metabolism, resulting in surface pCO 2 in nearly equilibrium with respect to the atmosphere. One exception is that a hurricane triggered bloom in October rapidly increased surface DO% and drove the middle and lower bays to be autotrophic in 2-3 d. Overall, high turbidity in estuaries limits gross primary production even if there are large amounts of nutrients (Gattuso et al. 1998), sustaining the oversaturated pCO 2 in the upper and middle bay. In contrast, low turbidity, as well as favorable temperature and riverine nutrient input, result in high production and undersaturated surface pCO 2 in the lower-reach of the upper bay and middle bay.",False,False,False,
765,10.1002/lno.11573,22,True,"Seasonal temperature change and air-water gas exchange also contribute to surface pCO 2 variations, while these processes are usually overwhelmed by metabolic balance in productive estuaries. For example. in the upper bay, an increase in temperature increases pCO 2 % and DO% due to thermodynamic effects from May to August, which could explain the pCO 2 % increase but not the decreasing DO%. Respiration rapidly decreases DO% and sustains the undersaturated DO%. Gas exchange also rapidly degasses CO 2 into the atmosphere as shown by 100% DO and > 100% pCO 2 in June and August. For a water mass with 2500 μatm pCO 2 , the surface water needs ~60 d to degas to be in equilibrium with the atmosphere. Since the bay has a 180 d average water residence time, ventilation of CO 2 to the atmosphere allows the water in the middle and lower bay to be equilibrated with the atmosphere and further can allow biological production to drive the surface to be a CO 2 sink.There is a limitation involved in interpreting the relationship of pCO 2 % and DO%. This analysis assumes equilibrium between water and air with 100% DO and pCO 2 as a reference. For the winter data in the Chesapeake Bay, surface pCO 2 was consistently lower than the atmosphere due to the low surface temperature. The reference point for metabolic balance should be < 100% pCO 2 while ~100% DO due to fast air-water gas exchange rate for oxygen. High gas exchange rates and low primary production in winter sustained nearly saturated DO, even if pCO 2 % was oversaturated. Although bubble injection increasing DO% can be neglected when wind speed is lower than 10 m s -1 (Emerson et al. 2019), sustained wind gusts higher than this value were observed intermittently, which could partially contribute to oversaturated DO% in surface waters. Besides, the supersaturated DO% in February was majorly controlled by high biological production.",False,False,False,
766,10.1002/lno.11573,23,True,"## Influence of river-borne CO 2 input on regulating surface pCO 2 in the estuary
River-borne high pCO 2 is a product of the microbial degradation of organic matter in river water, sediments, and soils, which can be an important process sustaining high estuarine pCO 2 (Borges et al. 2006). We use riverine excess DIC (DIC Excess-R ) proposed by Abril et al. (2000) to evaluate the seasonal patterns and magnitude of river-borne CO 2 . It is calculated as the difference between the in situ DIC (DIC Measured ) and DIC calculated from atmospheric pCO 2 and in situ total alkalinity (TA) at in situ temperature and salinity (DIC Equil ), see Eq. 5. Here we calculate TA from DIC and pH to avoid the potential influence of organic alkalinity.",False,False,False,
767,10.1002/lno.11573,24,True,"The DIC Excess-R concentrations were all positive and controlled by both river discharge and the seasonal temperature cycle (Fig. 6). DIC Excess-R covaries with Riverine pCO 2 , indicating that the Susquehanna River exports DIC Excess-R into the bay and contributes dynamically to monthly surface pCO 2 levels within the bay. DIC Excess-R were high in February and March (up to 155 μmol kg -1 ) when discharge was high and temperature was low, and in June and July (up to 156 μmol kg -1 ) when discharge was low and temperature was high. A high discharge rapidly flushes large amounts of respired products, and therefore corresponds to high DIC Excess- R and observed oversaturated pCO 2 in the upper bay (Fig. 3). River discharge peaked in February, while the DIC Excess-R was smaller than in March. It was because the end-member was sampled on 01 February during which daily discharge was one-third of the monthly mean value in February and a half that of March. Scaling up the pCO 2 in February by discharge results in higher DIC Excess-R in February. Although discharge was low in June and July, the high temperature supported microbial respiration in the river, increasing DIC Excess-R and supporting oversaturated pCO 2 downstream. The lowest DIC Excess-R was observed in April and May (as low as 11 μmol kg -1 ) which is explained by the spring blooms in the river and supported by the highest Chl a. Nutrients flushed downstream in February and March also triggered spring bloom and undersaturated pCO 2 in the upper-reach of the upper bay in April and May (Fig. 3). Moderate DIC Excess-R from June to October also sustained high surface pCO 2 in the upper bay. One exception was in August (68 μmol kg -1 ) which was lower than months before and after, indicating utilization of inorganic nutrients and carbon in the reservoir right above a dam in the Susquehanna River, which was not reflected by the low Chl a downstream of the dam due to low river discharge. Additionally, very low DIC Excess-R observed in winter (as low as 22 μmol kg -1 ) can be attributed to low temperature and organic matter respiration rates. In summary, positive values of DIC Excess-R suggest the importance of river-borne CO 2 in sustaining oversaturated pCO 2 in the upper bay.",False,False,False,

Previous studies have found that the James River had little impact on main stem chemistry (Wong 1979;Fisher et al. 1988) and that the others may be the same because most of the river constituents are processed in the sub-estuary (Boynton et al. 1995).

770,10.1002/lno.11573,27,True,"## DIC Excess
Since pCO 2 at the bay mouth was nearly equilibrated with the atmosphere, the ocean end-member is characterized by zero DIC Excess-R with an average salinity of 31 (Eq. 7). Thus if DIC Excess-B is 0, it means all river delivered excess DIC is degassed to the atmosphere or consumed by biological production, as shown by a negative DIC Excess-net . And if DIC Excess- B equals to the mixing corrected DIC Excess-R , it means all riverine excess is transported to the coastal ocean, as shown by a zero DIC Excess-net . A positive DIC Excess-net indicates an addition of DIC to the estuary.Large inputs of DIC Excess-R were observed in March, June, and July (Fig. 6), as shown by large differences between DIC Excess-B and DIC Excess-net .

Although net large DIC removal was observed, surface pCO 2 was still supersaturated in the upper bay in all 3 months and the upper-reach of the middle bay in June, suggesting the important role of river-borne CO 2 in sustaining CO 2 degassing in this region. In contrast, DIC Excess-R roughly counterbalanced the DIC removal in the lower portion of the middle bay and the entire lower bay in June, resulting in surface pCO 2 nearly equilibrated with respect to the atmosphere.",False,False,False,

By comparison, DIC Excess-net was close to 0 in the upper bay in December, indicating nearly balanced DIC addition and removal. In this case, riverine pCO 2 and the observed surface pCO 2 in the bay are on the same level. In addition, due to potentially fewer allochthonous organic matter to support respiration in the middle and lower bay resulting from large distance away from the river mouth, net DIC removal driven by biological production over respiration sustained undersaturated surface pCO 2 .Moderate DIC Excess-R was observed from August to October due to decreasing river discharge. In August, net DIC removal within the bay through biological production was the major driver of the undersaturated surface pCO 2 in the lower portion of the upper bay, with favorable temperature and moderate inputs of nutrients from the river. By comparison, considering low river discharge and erosion of surface stratification in fall, the net DIC addition and removal can be related to the upward mixing of CO 2 and nutrient rich subsurface water into the surface and subsequent biological production. The dynamic feature did not support sustained net DIC removal while supported fluctuations in DIC Excess-net between positive and negative values. In this case, both DIC Excess-R and high pCO 2 subsurface water supported the oversaturated surface pCO 2 from August to October.",False,False,False,

The difference in CO 2 flux estimates of February between the field measurement in 2019 (-14.2 AE 1.5 mmol m -2 d -1 ) and the model-generated value in 2016 (-2.7 AE 9.0 mmol m -2 d -1 ) indicates a potential interannual variation. Given the inputs of riverine properties affecting the biogeochemical processes within the bay are associated with river discharge, we use the Susquehanna River discharge (~60% of the total river discharge to the Chesapeake Bay) to identify dry and wet hydrologic months (Fig. 8a). We use the lower bay as a case study due to its relatively invariant surface pCO 2 allowing for a simple simulation. The Susquehanna River water needs 2-3 months to reach the lower bay and the water resident time in the lower bay is about 4 months (Du and Shen 2016). We use the mean discharge from September to December in the previous year to identify the dry or wet hydrological status in the lower bay in February of the next year. Due to high discharge in these months of 2011 and 2018 (~2500 m 3 s -1 ), February 2012 and 2019 are wet months. By comparison, due to low discharge from 2015 to 2017 (~500 m 3 s -1 ), February 2016 and 2017 are dry months. Corresponding biogeochemical data from the Chesapeake Bay Program are used to study the difference between dry and wet months. Same hydrological scenarios have same levels of salinity (e.g., wet February for 2012 (13.5 AE 3.0) and 2019 (11.9 AE 3.2), and dry February for 2016 (19.9 AE 2.9) and 2017 (21.4 AE 2.9)). Salinities in wet months (5 < S < 15) are systematically lower than dry months (15 < S < 25) (Fig. 8b). Correspondingly, Chl a in wet months (11.4 AE 3.5 for 2012 and 10.9 AE 3.1 for 2019) are distinguishable higher than dry months (7.9 AE 2.6 for 2016 and 2.9 AE 1.0 for 2017) (Fig. 8c), indicating higher biological production in wet months which increased the air-water CO 2 influx.

Due to the similarity in biogeochemical properties among the same type hydrological months, we use lower bay field observations in October 2016 to represent October 2015. Then the carbonate properties in October 2015 are used as initial inputs to simulate pCO 2 level in February 2016 (dry month), see details in methods. In this simulation, water pCO 2 reached equilibrium with the atmosphere (410 μatm) in December, and was unchanged thereafter when only air-water gas exchange is assumed to contribute to pCO 2 variation (solid black line). In contrast, surface pCO 2 could be lower than the field measurement (blue dot, 289 μatm) by 30 μatm when only the temperature drop explains surface pCO 2 variation (solid green line). By coupling gas exchange with temperature variation, decreasing pCO 2 caused by a fast temperature drop could be reversed by significant replenishing of CO 2 via gas exchange, showing a simulated surface pCO 2 of 414 μatm in February (solid purple line). In this sense, observed pCO 2 values were a combined effect of processes including temperature variation, air-water gas exchange, and biological production, leading to a simulated pCO 2 of 300 μatm for February 2016 (solid blue line). Additionally, we simulate pCO 2 evolvement with different initial pCO 2 and salinity values, while keeping the same DIC removal rate (solid orange vs. solid blue lines). The simulation shows nearly identical pCO 2 trends since December, indicating that the pCO 2 variation is almost independent of the initial salinity and pCO 2 values, due to the rapid interactions among physical controlling processes.",False,False,False,

Lower buoy pCO 2 than simulated values support the assumption of the increased biological production in wet months. In addition, mean pCO 2 and salinity in the lower bay (green triangle, 240 AE 20 μatm, S = 16) was 49 μatm and 5.5 lower than near the bay mouth (blue dot, 289 μatm, S = 21.5) in February 2019.

The algorithm developed by Wanninkhof (2014), used in this study, produces good estimates within a wind speed range of 3-15 m s -1 , a range that covers conditions in the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay has a large surface area and is a microtidal system, so the selected algorithm works well in most sites on the bay. However, future work is still needed to validate the best gas transfer velocity in large estuaries and bay systems.",False,False,False,
776,10.1002/lno.11573,33,True,"## Diel variation
CO 2 diel fluctuations vary significantly in various environments with large variations in estuaries (Dai et al. 2009). To get a representative CO 2 flux estimate, we conducted repeated transects over the same region at various times to reduce the uncertainty of the estimated CO 2 flux attributed to the snapshot underway approach. Since we surveyed the same subregion of the Chesapeake Bay in the same day, mean pCO 2 difference between repeated transects within the same subregion is a measure of the performance of this approach. The smaller the difference, the better coverage of the diel cycle. The upper bay had the largest mean of 199 μatm and the lower and middle bay had small mean values of 16 and 18 μatm, respectively. Although it only results in small uncertainties in CO 2 flux estimate of 0.5, 0.1, and 0.2 mmol m -2 d -1 for the upper, middle, and lower bay, respectively, the relatively larger difference in the dynamic upper bay reflects the need for introducing high frequency underway monitoring or mooring observations. Spatial gradient from the main stem to nearshore
We assumed that there are no lateral variations in pCO 2 in the main stem. To verify it, we conducted transects to enter the Choptank River in June and August 2016 and the Potomac River in August 2016 to study the pCO 2 gradient. Surface pCO 2 showed small fluctuations (AE 10 μatm) from the main stem to the Choptank and Potomac River mouth while increased rapidly when entering the rivers. Over the areas we surveyed, surface pCO 2 increased by 70 μatm in the Potomac River, and by 158 μatm in June and 305 μatm in August in the Choptank River. Although the lateral gradients in the main stem are not significant, it should be noted that the actual difference might be larger under the influence of northerly and southerly winds, which drive upwelling of CO 2 -rich subsurface water into the surface in nearshore areas via Ekman transport (Huang et al. 2019). However, this large signal is not included in the CO 2 flux estimate of the main stem, and future work is needed to get a complete, more accurate estimate.",False,False,False,

We used underway measurements of pCO 2 and calculated pCO 2 to get high spatiotemporal coverage of pCO 2 . Although using calculated or measured pCO 2 has small differences in the estimated CO 2 flux, another uncertainty in the CO 2 flux estimate comes from sampling resolution, particularly for sampling patchy blooms located in between the sampling stations for the discrete measurements. For example, CO 2 flux is 10.9 AE 3.2 mmol C m -2 d -1 for underway measurement and 33.5 AE 19.8 mmol C m -2 d -1 for discrete samples in the upper bay in August, with the lower CO 2 flux relating to bloom sampled by underway. In this case, underway measurements had the advantage of capturing fine, undersaturated pCO 2 signals, which could result in a CO 2 flux one third of that from discrete data in bloom seasons. Generally, using a combination of evenly distributed and dense sampling sites can successfully reduce the uncertainties in CO 2 flux estimate.",False,False,False,
778,10.1002/lno.11573,35,True,"## A comparison of CO 2 flux estimates from various approaches
The estimated CO 2 flux in 2016 (3.7 AE 3.3 × 10 9 mol C) in this work is more positive than a model study of -12 × 10 9 mol C (Shen et al. 2019) and a conservative mixing model and mass balance analysis of -5.7 AE 8.2 × 10 9 mol C (Brodeur et al. 2019), while comparable with a field study of -1.8 × 10 9 mol C for the middle and lower bay (Friedman et al. 2020). In contrast, if our February 2019 data is incorporated into the CO 2 flux estimate for 2016, the delivered annual flux would be -0.3 × 10 9 mol C. Large variations in estimated CO 2 flux indicate that further work is needed to constrain the uncertainty residing in various estimation approaches and when incorporating multi-year observations. Shen et al. (2019) only used our spring to fall Carson cruises data for validation and reproduced similar trend of seasonal variation in CO 2 flux, although highly variable with oscillations between CO 2 release and uptake in the middle and lower bay were observed. The difference in CO 2 flux between the model study and this study might be caused by the lack of data for validation, particularly for the high discharge months (such as DNR and winter Carson cruises), to optimize the model. For example, the model results had smaller pCO 2 in the river mouth and larger biological production in the upper and middle bay than the field observations. On the other hand, the difference might be related to that the model explicitly captures the lateral variations and diel cycle. Therefore, more extensive observations are needed to capture the dynamic spatial and temporal features. Brodeur et al. (2019) estimated the carbon flux by calculating the difference in DIC inventory between input through river and export out of the bay. It should be noted that the DIC conservative mixing model used the DIC concentration of Susquehanna River to represent all rivers. Therefore, the discrepancy in CO 2 flux might be related to other DIC inputs, including other rivers, groundwater, or lateral transport. At the mouth of Potomac River, our field data showed that DIC was higher than the value predicted from the mixing line between Susquehanna River and oceanic water. It could result in a larger DIC input from rivers if we include the Potomac River, leading to a smaller difference in CO 2 flux between both studies. Therefore, extensive future work to monitor the river end-member might be important. Friedman et al. (2020) estimated CO 2 flux in the middle and lower bay through calculated pCO 2 from discrete DIC and TA samples which were collected from four cruises spanning from November 2016 to July 2017. This study reported that the Chesapeake Bay main stem was a CO 2 sink. According to our study, the upper bay is a strong CO 2 source to the atmosphere and should not be neglected in the CO 2 flux estimate over the bay. However, excluding the CO 2 flux in the upper bay, the annual CO 2 flux of -3.0 × 10 9 mol C from our study is similar to Friedman et al. (2020). Given 2016 and 2017 are classified as the same hydrological status with similar annual mean river discharge, the difference in CO 2 flux might be related to sampling frequency and resolution. In addition, the pCO 2 calculated using DIC and TA and CO2SYS is lower than measured pCO 2 due to the influence of organic alkalinity. In this case, the CO 2 flux in Friedman et al. (2020) should be more positive and shows to be a CO 2 source when including the CO 2 flux of the upper bay in our study. In summary, there is a need to reduce the uncertainty in CO 2 flux estimate using various approaches. Additionally, measurements of pCO 2 distribution in wet years is critical to understanding the interannual variation of CO 2 flux.",False,False,False,

Through high spatial and temporal coverage of pCO 2 measurements in the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay from March to December 2016 and in February 2019, we conclude that the Chesapeake Bay was a weak source of CO 2 to the atmosphere with an annual flux of 3.7 AE 3.3 × 10 9 mol C for the dry hydrologic year of 2016. Chesapeake Bay is an exceptionally large estuarine system with strong spatial gradients. The upper bay was river-dominated, and a net CO 2 source throughout the year (31.2 AE 5.6 mmol C m -2 d -1 ). The middle bay was a transition zone, with CO 2 degassing in the upper portion and CO 2 uptake in the lower portion. Overall, the middle bay was a CO 2 sink (-5.8 AE 1.3 mmol C m -2 d -1 ). The lower bay was ocean-dominated, and showed a balanced condition (1.0 AE 1.6 mmol C m -2 d -1 ). However, during wet months (such as February 2019), the lower bay was a strong CO 2 sink which will lead to a weaker bay-wide efflux or turn the bay into a CO 2 sink.Temperature variation, air-water gas exchange, biological production/respiration, and mixing controlled surface pCO 2 distribution from the upper to the lower bay. At the subsection level, river-borne CO 2 and the respiration of allochthonous and locally produced organic carbon supported oversaturated pCO 2 in the upper bay. Because of the long water residence time, CO 2 removal from the surface water under multiple processes decreased pCO 2 from the upper bay to the middle bay to the level of atmospheric CO 2 . In the lower bay, temperature variation, biological activity, and airwater gas exchange controlled the pCO 2 variation. Through this work, we reported the first comprehensive annual observation of surface pCO 2 and air-water CO 2 flux along the main stem of the Chesapeake Bay.",False,False,False,

To get a more complete understanding of CO 2 flux in the Chesapeake Bay, field measurements for wet months and years and interannual modeling studies could be very important to elucidate systematic controlling mechanisms. In the future, continuous field measurements of pCO 2 are also needed to capture dynamic features, to study the long-term trends of CO 2 fluxes responding to rapid climate change, and to quantify anthropogenic stresses. Yet, as we have demonstrated in this paper, a great deal of information about CO 2 flux in a large bay system with stratification, long water residence times, and extensive ocean influence can be learned. In contrast to small and medium size river-dominated estuaries which release a large amount of CO 2 to the atmosphere, the large Chesapeake Bay serves as a weak source of CO 2 with a broad spatial and temporal variation. Further studies in large bays and estuaries will be important to constrain the estimate of global carbon budget in estuaries.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Tidal wetland reclamation is a worldwide issue that profoundly alters ecological functions and ecosystem service provisions; however, its impacts on sediment microbial communities and functions remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatial and seasonal patterns of greenhouse gas (GHG) production in response to land use change in mangrove wetlands and elucidated the underlying mechanisms by integrating environmental parameters and microbial community characteristics. In the time period studied, land use change substantially reduced the sediment organic matter content, microbial community richness and diversity, and CO 2 production rates. Converting mangroves to drier land cover types, namely orchard and vegetable field, significantly diminished reducing substrates (sulfide, Fe 2+ , and NH 4",False,False,True,

), microbial network complexity and stability, and CH 4 production rates, while increasing N 2 O production rates. In contrast, these parameters showed the opposite trend following the conversion of mangroves to flooded aquaculture pond. Overall GHG production rate in mangrove wetlands was 399.8 mg CO 2 e kg À1 d À1 , which respectively decreased by 68.83%, 69.86%, and 30.84% in orchard, vegetable field, and aquaculture pond. Microbial community richness and network complexity and stability were strongly related to the production rates of CH 4 and N 2 O, rather than CO 2 , which can be better indicators of specialized functions (CH 4 and N 2 O production). Therefore, preserving microbial ""interaction"" could be important to mitigate the negative effects of microbial community richness and diversity loss caused by human activities in aquatic environments.

The estimated global carbon storage capacity of wetlands is over 53.7 Tg C yr À1 (Wang et al. 2021). However, a net loss of 4000 km 2 of intertidal land occurred globally from 1999 to 2019, and 27% of this loss was directly associated with human activities, notably land use conversion (Murray et al. 2022). Among coastal wetlands, mangroves are distinguished by their substantial carbon storage capacity and play a crucial role in the global carbon equilibrium and human-caused climate change abatement (Scully et al. 2004;Chielle et al. 2024).

Researchers have demonstrated that the transformation of mangroves into aquaculture ponds leads to elevated sediment GHG emissions, which are attributed to the accumulation of organic waste, uneaten feed, detritus, and excreta from cultivated species (Kauffman et al. 2018). However, it has also been shown that the conversion of mangroves to aquaculture ponds, fallow land, or coconut groves can substantially curtail sediment CO 2 and CH 4 emissions while concurrently amplifying N 2 O release (Castillo et al. 2017), potentially regulated by gas transport pathways (Yang et al. 2022b), substrate availability (Dong et al. 2023), and functional microbes (Yang et al. 2022c;Yang et al. 2024). Metaanalyses have also revealed that the influence of land use change on sediment carbon stocks and GHG emissions depends on the type of change, and whether this effect is significant remains debatable (Sasmito et al. 2019;Sasmito et al. 2020;Tan et al. 2020). Although there has been much research on the effects of land use change on sediment GHG emissions of mangrove wetlands, controversies and uncertainties remain regarding the effects of biotic and abiotic factors as well as the resulting positive or negative feedback for global climate warming, further complicating the assessment of service functions of the ""blue carbon"" ecosystems (Macreadie et al. 2021;Rosentreter et al. 2023).",True,False,False,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **mangrove wetlands**.

In this context, we investigated seasonal patterns of GHG emissions in a native mangrove wetland and two adjacent areas converted to drier land use types (an orchard and vegetable field) as well as a permanently flooded aquaculture pond and discovered the underlying mechanisms by integrating information regarding environmental parameters and microbial communities.

The study area, located on the western bank of the Pearl River Estuary in China (22.628 N,113.606 E; Fig. 1a,b), is characterized by a humid subtropical climate with a mean annual temperature of 22 C and rainfall of 1690 mm (Huang et al. 2021). Many mangrove wetlands in this area have been converted to croplands and aquaculture ponds; the predominant mangrove species in the remaining wetlands are Kandelia obovata, Aegiceras corniculatum, and Avicennia marina (Li et al. 2011).Surface (0-5 cm) soil/sediment samples were collected in quadruplicate from a mangrove wetland (Kandelia obovata), an adjacent orchard (Musa acuminate L.), a vegetable field (Luffa acutangula L.), and a shrimp aquaculture pond (Litopenaeus vannamei) (Fig. 1c) in May, August, and November 2019 and in February 2020. In the mangrove wetland, the humus layer was removed before collection. Overlying water samples were filtered through 0.2-μm filters (Millipore, Bedford, USA). Samples were transported to the laboratory on ice within 12 h. In the laboratory, water samples were stored at À20 C. Soil/sediment samples were immediately mixed thoroughly in an N 2 -filled glove bag (A-SONE, Japan), divided into three parts, and stored at 4 C, À20 C, and À80 C for GHG production rates measurement, physicochemical properties determination, and microbial community analysis, respectively.",False,False,False,

Soil samples (10 g) from the orchard, vegetable field, and mangrove were placed in 250-mL brown glass bottles. Triplicate bottles and three soil/sediment-free controls were flushed with air for 5 min, sealed with an airtight butyl rubber stopper, and aerobically incubated at in situ temperatures in the dark for 24 h (Lang et al. 2011;Liu et al. 2019). In the case of the mangrove and aquaculture pond, each sediment sample was transferred to a borosilicate container with filtered site benthic water (1 : 5 mass ratio), homogenized, and flushed with N 2 (15 min). A total of 50 g sediment slurry was transferred into each bottle. Triplicate bottles and three sediment-free controls were flushed with N 2 for 5 min, sealed with an airtight butyl rubber stopper, and incubated anaerobically at in situ temperatures in the dark for 24 h (Gonsalves et al. 2011;Marotta et al. 2014;Praetzel et al. 2020). Afterwards, approximately 12 mL of headspace gas from each bottle was collected by vigorous shaking using a syringe and stored in 12-mL evacuated vials (Labco, UK). The CO 2 , CH 4 , and N 2 O concentrations were determined via gas chromatography (Shimadzu GC-2014) using Porapak-N and HayeSep-D and Molecular Sieve MS13 columns equipped with TCD (CO 2 ), FID (CH 4 ), and ECD (N 2 O) detectors (Shimadzu, USA). The GHG production rates were calculated using linear regression. Considering the periodic alternations between flooding (anaerobic) and non-flooding (aerobic) conditions of mangrove wetlands due to tidal action, the GHG production rates of mangrove wetlands were measured under both scenarios. The final production rates were calculated by multiplying the rates under anaerobic and aerobic conditions by their respective time proportions (anaerobic period, 62.74%; aerobic period, 37.26%) (Wu et al. 2024). The overall GHG production rate was converted into a CO 2 -equivalent (CO 2 e) based on the Global Warming Potential over a 100-yr timeframe (GWP 100 ) of 28 for CH 4 and 273 for N 2 O, as set by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (Forster et al. 2021).",False,False,False,

## Seasonal patterns of environmental parameters in different land-use types
Generally, the environmental parameters showed no significant seasonal differences in the orchard and vegetable field, except for NO 3 À in spring, pH and Fe 3+ in summer, and TN in autumn (Fig. 2 and Supporting Information Table S1). In the mangrove wetland, sediment organic matter (TOC, TN, Chl a, DOC, EOC, and LFOC) and oxidized ions (NO 3 À and Fe 3+ ) in summer were profoundly lower than in other seasons (Fig. 2f,h,i-n; p < 0.05). In the aquaculture pond, sediment pH, NO 3 À , Fe 2+ , TN, Chl a, and DOC were lower in summer than in the other seasons (Fig. 2b,f,g,j,k,l), whereas NH 4 + levels were significantly higher (Fig. 2e; p < 0.05). Spatially, the physicochemical properties were influenced by land use change (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Evidently, the conversion of mangrove areas to drier lands (the orchard and vegetable field) significantly reduced sediment water content, pH, MФ, sulfide, and organic matter (Fig. 2a-d, i-n; p < 0.05). The conversion of mangroves to permanently flooded aquaculture ponds also significantly reduced most organic matter (TOC, DOC, EOC, and LFOC) (excluding DOC in winter; Fig. 2i,l-n; p < 0.05) and DO in the overlying water (Supporting Information Table S2).

811,10.1002/lno.70028,22,True,"In addition, a lower temperature sensitivity (Q 10 ) of GHG production rates was observed after mangrove conversion (Supporting Information Fig. S5). Weakened Q 10 associated with reclamation activities is mainly attributed to the reduction in substrate availability and microbial biomass in the sediments (Zhang et al. 2020). Lower microbial community richness in agricultural and aquacultural lands (Fig. 3a) may inhibit organic carbon decomposition and reduce the Q 10 value. Our findings highlight that the temperature responses of GHG production to land use change should be factored into an accurate estimation and prediction of GHG emissions from mangrove wetlands. Spatially, the soil/sediment redox conditions and substrate availability are critical for GHG production. Moisture changes due to land use conversion primarily affected the redox conditions (Fe 2+ , Fe 2+ : Fe 3+ , and sulfide), driving spatial variations in CH 4 production rates and CH 4 % (Supporting Information Figs. S3, S6). In drier land-the orchard and vegetable fieldlow relative abundances of hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanocella and Rice Cluster I) (Supporting Information Fig. S7) resulted in CH 4 sinks (Fig. 5a). Conversely, increased waterlogging following the conversion of mangrove areas to the aquaculture pond boosted CH 4 production, which correlated positively with methanogenic Methanobacteriaceae (e.g., OTUs 52 and 892) (Fig. 6 and Supporting Information Fig. S7), consistent with observations in periodically waterlogged grasslands (Angel et al. 2012) and intertidal wetlands (Chen et al. 2023). This is mainly attributed to strictly anaerobic methanogens in low-redox environments (Le Mer and Roger 2001). The concurrent enhancement of the overlying water DOC resulting from bait residues further strengthens CH 4 production in aquaculture ponds (Lin and Lin 2022). In addition, CH 4 oxidation mitigates CH 4 emissions from wetlands. Even under anaerobic conditions, CH 4 can undergo oxidation to CO 2 using alternative electron acceptors such as NO 3 À , Fe 3+ , Mn 4+ , and sulfate (Rissanen et al. 2017;La et al. 2022;Chen et al. 2023). Given that CH 4 has a global warming potential approximately 28 times greater than that of CO 2 (Forster et al. 2021), the significant enhancement of CH 4 production facilitated by the conversion of mangrove areas to aquaculture ponds is of concern. For effective mitigation of the global warming potential, it would be preferable for sediment organic carbon to be released as CO 2 rather than CH 4 .",False,False,True,
812,10.1002/lno.70028,23,True,"In the experimental sites of the present study, the CO 2 production rates were primarily influenced by substrate availability (TOC, EOC, LFOC, and DOC) (Supporting Information Fig. S6). Mangroves are highly productive ecosystems that provide anaerobic conditions and are rich in sediment organic matter (Arnaud et al. 2023). Based on our analyses, TOC and TN contents decreased after mangrove conversion, indicating reduced carbon storage potential and faster nutrient cycling, which could accelerate resource transitions and alter microbial communities (Yu et al. 2020). We found that CO 2 production rates were much higher in mangrove wetland (7.73 AE 6.73 mmol kg À1 d À1 ) than in the aquaculture pond (2.66 AE 1.29 mmol kg À1 d À1 ), confirming that mangrove sediments remain a significant CO 2 source. These results align with those of two previous studies but contradict others (Supporting Information Table S7). Such inconsistencies may be related to variations in mangrove geomorphology (deltas, estuaries, lagoons, and open coasts) and aquaculture density (Zhang et al. 2022;Arnaud et al. 2023).",True,True,True,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **mangrove wetlands** and **aquaculture ponds**.

813,10.1002/lno.70028,24,True,"Microbial nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification are primary processes responsible for N 2 O emissions from various ecosystems. In the present study, N 2 O production was higher in the converted orchard and vegetable field than in the native mangroves (Fig. 5a). N 2 O production was negatively correlated with water content, Fe 2+ , and pH but positively correlated with NO 3 À (Supporting Information Fig. S6). Water content influences O 2 availability, thus regulating the nitrification/denitrification processes and N 2 O emissions (Krichels et al. 2023). The measured soil moisture of the orchard and vegetable field in this study ranged from 14.8% to 30.8%, which is well below the threshold (60%) at which nitrification is the dominant N 2 O production pathway (Bollmann and Conrad 1998). A significant negative correlation between the TOC : NO x À ratio and N 2 O production (Supporting Information Fig. S8) suggests that high NO x À levels at denitrifying microsites may reduce N 2 O reduction when the availability of electron donors is lower than the demand from electron acceptors (Senbayram et al. 2019). This can potentially explain why agriculture, linked to increased nitrogen fertilizer use, is a major source of anthropogenic N 2 O emissions (Makowski 2019). In the present study, a higher abundance of nitrifying and denitrifying OTUs was found in the orchard and vegetable field (Supporting Information Fig. S9), which further supports the strengthened N 2 O production. The resilience and activity of ammonia-oxidizing Nitrososphaera and complete ammonia-oxidizing Nitrospira are enhanced under slightly acidic conditions owing to pH homeostasis and higher substrate affinity (Xu et al. 2020).",False,False,True,

Land use conversion has considerably affected ecosystem function and stability due to biodiversity loss (Loreau and de Mazancourt 2013). We found that the conversion of mangrove wetland to drier orchard and vegetable field has significantly reduced microbial community richness and diversity, microbial network complexity and stability, and GHG production (Figs. 3a, 4). This indicates that moisture content is an important factor in controlling microbial network complexity and stability, consistent with findings in grasslands where increasing aridity weakens bacterial network complexity (Yuan et al. 2021;Zhang et al. 2024). Reduced moisture can decrease organism productivity, and a low quantity of resources may provide limited niches for microbial species to coexist, causing diversity loss and ultimately impacting biogeochemical cycles and ecosystem functioning (Zhang et al. 2024).Although reduced microbial community richness and diversity were evident in the aquaculture pond, compared with native mangroves, network complexity and stability increased (Figs. 3a, 4). Aquaculture activities, such as bait feeding, may compensate for diversity loss by increasing network complexity and stability, aiming to maintain ecosystem function amid frequent human disturbance. Previous studies have also supported this, showing that land use conversion, grazing, and fertilization can enhance microbial network complexity and stability in grasslands (Cornell et al. 2023) and paddies (Chen et al. 2024). Therefore, if the observed alternations of the microbial network by aquaculture disturbance in this study can be applicable to other ecosystems, preserving microbial ""interaction"" could be important to mitigate the negative effects of anthropogenic biodiversity loss due to human activities on ecosystem functions.",False,False,False,

This is mainly due to the high redundancy in general functions, such as microbial respiration and organic matter decomposition, whereas specialized functions, such as CH 4 generation/oxidation and nitrification/denitrification, are more sensitive to changes in microbial network complexity and stability (Cornell et al. 2023). These characteristics may be better predictors of soil/sediment-specialized functions (CH 4 and N 2 O production) across various ecosystems. We also suggest that future research should consider microbial community richness, diversity, composition, co-occurrence, and environmental conditions to more accurately predict microbial functions, such as GHG emissions.",False,False,False,

Mangrove forests store large amounts of carbon, mitigate the effects of storms on human settlements, and bolster aquatic food resources. However, more than one-third of global mangrove wetlands have been deforested over the past 60 yr, with annual losses of 131-639 km 2 , removing approximately 462.5 Mt of carbon stock between 1996 and 2016 (Hamilton and Casey 2016;Richards et al. 2020). Deforestation of mangrove wetlands is also estimated to release 2-75 Tg of carbon per year from sediments, equivalent to 7.3-275 Tg of CO 2 e emissions (Atwood et al. 2017). Collectively, the results of previous studies, as well as the results reported in the present study, have shown that land use change from mangrove to agricultural purposes can reduce sediment organic carbon levels (Supporting Information Table S7). Given that it takes thousands of years for mangrove sediment carbon deposits to form, carbon losses from mangrove deforestation cannot be reversed over any meaningful human timescale by restoring disrupted forests; rather, greater priority should be given to protecting the existing carbon stocks in the sediments of established mangrove wetlands.",True,True,False,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **mangrove forests** (and specifically, **mangrove wetlands**).

Globally, the net primary productivity of mangroves is approximately 200 Tg C yr À1 , with approximately 20% released into the atmosphere via sediment respiratory efflux (Alongi and Mukhopadhyay 2015). Our findings indicate that large carbon stocks in mangrove sediments are vulnerable to loss via aerobic respiration and anaerobic fermentation (Fig. 7). Although mangroves are important ""blue carbon"" ecosystems, their surface sediments remain a hotspot for global GHG emissions. It is noteworthy that in the present study we focused on superficial sediments; additional analyses are needed along the depth profiles to obtain a more comprehensive estimation of GHG emissions from different media in mangrove ecosystems, which could provide accurate foundational data to support carbon mitigation initiatives. Owing to the substantial spatial heterogeneity of mangrove sediments and the variety of land use types following reclamation (Richards and Friess 2015), future research should focus on more intensive field surveys in combination with remote sensing and machine learning to collect data at a global scale. In addition, our measured GHG production rates based on incubation methods may not reflect the dynamics of in situ conditions influenced by natural drivers (e.g., rain events, river flow, and periodic tidal flushing) and human activities (e.g., fertilization, irrigation, and bait feeding).

## Abstract
The Arctic Ocean subseabed holds vast reservoirs of the potent greenhouse gas methane (CH 4 ), often seeping into the ocean water column. In a continuously warming ocean as a result of climate change an increase of CH 4 seepage from the seabed is hypothesized. Today, CH 4 is largely retained in the water column due to the activity of methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) that thrive there. Predicted future oceanographic changes, bottom water warming and increasing CH 4 release may alter efficacy of this microbially mediated CH 4 sink. Here we investigate the composition and principle controls on abundance and activity of the MOB communities at the shallow continental shelf west of Svalbard, which is subject to strong seasonal changes in oceanographic conditions. Covering a large area (364 km 2 ), we measured vertical distribution of microbial methane oxidation (MOx) rates, MOB community composition, dissolved CH 4 concentrations, temperature and salinity four times throughout spring and summer during three consecutive years. Sequencing analyses of the pmoA gene revealed a small, relatively uniform community mainly composed of type-Ia methanotrophs (deep-sea 3 clade). We found highest MOx rates (7 nM d -1 ) in summer in bathymetric depressions filled with stagnant Atlantic Water containing moderate concentrations of dissolved CH 4 (< 100 nM). MOx rates in these depressions during spring were much lower (< 0.5 nM d -1 ) due to lower temperatures and mixing of Transformed Atlantic Water flushing MOB with the Atlantic Water out of the depressions. Our results show that MOB and MOx in CH 4 -rich bottom waters are highly affected by geomorphology and seasonal conditions.",False,False,False,

Temperature rise in the Arctic and its impact on the environment is more severe than for any other region on Earth (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2006;Hansen et al. 2013). The Arctic Ocean holds vast reservoirs of CH 4 , which has a 32-fold higher greenhouse warming potential than carbon dioxide and may be released into the ocean and the atmosphere (Etminan et al. 2016). The majority of the CH 4 reservoirs across the Arctic shelves are temperature-sensitive, e.g., subsea permafrost (Shakhova et al. 2010) and gas hydrates in shallow sediments (Westbrook et al. 2009;Berndt et al. 2014). Gaseous CH 4 released from the seafloor becomes dissolved and can then be utilized by aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB), which use CH 4 as an energy source and carbon substrate for growth (e.g., Hanson and Hanson 1996;Murrell 2010). In the ocean, aerobic microbial methane oxidation (MOx) is the final sink for CH 4 before it is liberated to the atmosphere (Reeburgh 2007), but little is known about the diversity, abundance, distribution, and activity of MOB (Tavormina et al. 2008;Mau et al. 2013;Steinle et al. 2015). For example, high amounts of CH 4 were rapidly consumed by MOB following the deep-water horizon accident (Crespo-Medina et al. 2014) and MOB were found to effectively consume CH 4 from the water column if hydrographic conditions provide continuity for MOB (Steinle et al. 2015(Steinle et al. , 2017)). However, MOx can also be very low despite high CH 4 concentrations in marine waters for reasons that are still unclear (Bussmann 2013).",False,False,False,
826,10.1002/lno.11731,2,True,"Aerobic MOB are phylogenetically divided into Gammaproteobacteria (type I MOB), Alphaproteobacteria (type II MOB) (e.g., Hanson and Hanson 1996;Knief 2015), and Verrucomicrobia (type III MOB) (Dunfield et al. 2007;Op den Camp et al. 2009;van Teeseling et al. 2014). Common to almost all MOB is the presence of the membrane-bound particulate methane monooxygenase, the enzyme responsible for the initial step of methane oxidation. The highly conserved pmoA gene, encoding a subunit of the particulate methane monooxygenase, is most frequently used as a molecular marker both for detection and phylogeny of MOB via cultivationindependent methods (Tavormina et al. 2008;Knief 2015). Potential methane-oxidizing uncultivated clades like the deepsea clades 1-5 (Lüke and Frenzel 2011) have been identified by this approach. Especially in marine environments, great uncertainties exist about the factors that determine MOB activity and community structure. From the Arctic marine environment, a number of studies report on MOx activity and MOB community composition in relation to environmental factors such as CH 4 concentrations and hydrography (e.g., Mau et al. 2013;Steinle et al. 2015;Osudar et al. 2016).

Only Steinle et al. (2015) compared spatiotemporal replicates collected during several surveys at the Svalbard continental margin in late August. Time series studies covering seasonal changes of CH 4 input and microbial CH 4 turnover in the water column in the Arctic have so far not been published, and little knowledge exists on the community composition of Arctic Ocean MOB (James et al. 2016;Ferré et al. 2020).In this study, we investigate the fate of CH 4 in the water column at the continental margin west of Svalbard, specifically the shallow shelf west off Prins Karls Forland. This area is characterized by CH 4 seepage (Portnov et al. 2016;Silyakova et al. 2020). Despite extensive release of CH 4 from the sediment in this area, almost no CH 4 was found to reach the atmosphere (Myhre et al. 2016). Our main objectives were (1) to study the composition and activity of the methanotrophic communities, (2) to investigate seasonal shifts and, related to these, (3) the differential hydrographical settings and their influence on MOB activity and distribution within the study area. To meet these aims, we conducted sampling surveys in the spring, late spring and summer.We found that community changes of MOB are marginal, but that MOx capacity is influenced by seasonal shifts and varies according to site-specific geographical features and changing hydrographical conditions.",False,False,False,

## Study area
Our study area stretches along the continental margin off western Svalbard from the shallow shelf west of Prins Karls Forland towards the southern tip of Svalbard including Isfjorden, Isfjorden Trough, Outer Bellsundet, Outer Hornsund, and Sørkappøya (Fig. 1). Water depth in these areas ranges from 50 to 160 m. The shallow shelf west of Prins Karls Forland is characterized by an irregular bathymetry showing numerous large depressions encompassed by a series of moraine ridges termed the Forlandet moraine complex (Landvik et al. 2005; Fig. 1B). Here, along the Forlandet moraine complex in 80-90 m water depth, a vast number of gas flares (~200 flares, identified by acoustic signatures of gas bubbles in the water) were previously mapped (Sahling et al. 2014;Silyakova et al. 2020). The δ 13 C values of the emitted CH 4 and the absence of higher hydrocarbons in the seeping gas indicates a microbial CH 4 origin (Graves et al. 2017;Mau et al. 2017). The seepage region west of Prins Karls Forland lies > 200 m shallower than the upper limit of the methane hydrate stability zone and unlikely results from CH 4 hydrates dissociating in situ. However, lateral migration of CH 4 from a hypothesized gas hydrate dissociation front at deeper shelf settings may at least partly fuel the seeps on the shallow shelf (Sarkar et al. 2012).",False,False,False,
829,10.1002/lno.11731,5,True,"The hydrodynamics in our study area are complex (see also Silyakova et al. 2020). The East Spitsbergen Current flows along the Svalbard islands southwards on the east side, following the coast around the island's southern tip and then turns northwards on the west side of the island (Nilsen et al. 2008). Here, it flows as a coastal current on the shelf and is composed of less saline and cold Arctic  to 1.0 C) into our study area. To the west of the shelf, the northernmost extension of the North Atlantic Current, the West Spitsbergen Current (Aagaard et al. 1987) is composed of relatively saline and warm Atlantic Water (> 34.65, > 3.0 C) and also flows northward. Although the East Spitsbergen Current and West Spitsbergen Current are separated by a front, frequent mixing occurs and the West Spitsbergen Current may also flood the shelf (Steinle et al. 2015). Seasonality defines the different portions of mixed water masses. Atlantic Water transforms into Transformed Atlantic Water (> 34.65, 1.0-3.0 C) by losing heat to the atmosphere and adjacent waters and freshening due to meltwater from glaciers, snow and sea ice. Whereas Intermediate Water (34.00-34.65, > 1.0 C) is formed by entrainment and mixing mechanisms at the boundary of Surface Water with underlying Atlantic Water or Transformed Atlantic Water. Surface Waters are freshened by melt water and warmed by solar heat in summer (< 34.00, < 1.0 C). Waters that overwinter in fjords become colder and fresher, and are then classified as Local Water mass (34.30-34.85, -0.5 to 1.0 C). Water masses are classified according to Cottier et al. (2005).",False,False,False,

Samples were taken within three successive years (2015-2017) during four expeditions with R/V Helmer Hansen,  CAGE15-3 (summer: 1-3 July 2015). At the shallow shelf west of Prins Karls Forland, we collected samples at 64 hydrographic stations arranged in a grid pattern covering an area of approximately 14 × 26 km. All stations were sampled successively (total sampling time of the entire grid < 72 h). The positions of transects and stations were selected according to their coverage of specific features found at the seafloor such as gas flares or bathymetric depressions (Fig. 1B). For example, the western N-S transect follows the main ridge of the Forlandet moraine complex and covers numerous CH 4 flares. The southern W-E transect features a flare cluster in the west and covers bathymetric depressions towards the east. During the June survey in 2016, time constrains allowed us to only sample 12 of the 64 stations. Those 12 stations were located along the western N-S, eastern N-S, and southern W-E transects (Fig. 1B, Table S1). At all stations, hydrographic parameters (salinity, temperature, pressure) were recorded at 24 Hz with a Conductivity-temperature-depth profiler (SBE 911 plus CTD; Sea-Bird Electronics, Inc., USA) equipped with twelve 5-liter Teflon-lined Niskin bottles. Only downcasts were used for hydrographic profiling. With the CTD-mounted Niskin bottles, we collected discrete water samples from eight water levels (1-8): 5, 15, 25 m above seafloor, 5, 15, 25 m below sea level, and two additional intermediate sampling levels evenly spaced between 25 m below sea level and 25 m above seafloor (actual sampling depth depending on water depth; Table 1). Water from the Niskin bottles was subsampled immediately upon recovery. Dissolved CH 4 concentrations were measured in all eight water levels of the entire sampling grid. MOx rates were measured in all eight water levels along four transects, which run from north to south (eastern N-S and western N-S) and west to east (northern W-E and southern W-E) (comprising 31 stations, Fig. 1B). Samples for phylogenetic analyses were recovered during sampling campaigns in July 2015 as well as May and June 2016 (but not in May 2017) from water levels 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 from all stations where MOx rates were measured. During the May 2016 campaign, six stations (Stas. 9,16,31,44,54,and 64) along the southern W-E transect were repeatedly investigated 2 days after the first sampling to monitor rapid variations of hydrographic conditions and their effects on MOx activity and bacterial community changes.",False,True,False,

Methane concentrations were determined using a headspace method as described by Silyakova et al. (2020). In order to calculate the content of dissolved CH 4 of the entire sampling area at the shallow shelf of Prins Karls Forland, we defined three water layers with consideration of the uneven bathymetry (Silyakova et al. 2020). Water layers were defined as the ""Bottom Water Layer"" from seafloor to 25 m above seafloor (comprising levels 1, 2, and 3), the ""Surface Water Layer"" from the ocean surface down to 25 m depth (comprising levels 8, 7, and 6), and the ""Intermediate Layer"" between 25 m below the ocean surface and 25 m above seafloor (comprising levels 5 and 4) (Table 1).",False,True,False,

For the water column at the sampling area west of Prins Karls Forland, the mean areal turnover of CH 4 was calculated by integrating distinct MOx rates over depth yielding results in m -2 d -1 for each water layer and the entire water column (Steinle et al. 2017). We then calculated weighted MOx means for each layer, considering uneven horizontal spacing of the hydro cast stations (for a more detailed description of the computation of the weighted means see Silyakova et al. (2020)). Upscaled to the size of the sampling grid (423 km 2 ), these weighted means translate to a total CH 4 turnover per day for each water layer and the entire water body of the sampling grid. To compare the capacity of MOx to retain CH 4 , we then calculated the fraction of CH 4 consumed per day:
Bacterial community analyses Seawater samples for molecular analysis were collected in sterile, high-density polyethylene bottles and usually processed immediately after subsampling. However, time constraints sometimes required storage of samples at 4 C in the dark before further processing, but storage time never exceed 4 h. We filtered a volume of 1 liter of sample on membrane filters (Whatman Nuclepore Track-Etched PC, 0.22 μm, Merck Millipore, MA) by applying a gentle vacuum of ~0.5 bar and stored filters at -20 C until further analyses. Total DNA from membrane filters was extracted following the method of Pilloni et al.

To reduce the computational need in the following steps, unique sequences were extracted. Operational phylogenetic units (OPUs) were defined by using USEARCH (v11; Edgar ( 2010)) applying a similarity threshold of 97%. The most abundant reads of each OPU were then selected to find the closest known sequences in the pmoA gene reference database (on nucleotide level, Wen et al.

In May 2016, the entire water column was dominated by Transformed Atlantic Water with high salinity of 34.9-35.0 and temperatures between 1.6 and 2.3 C (Fig. 2A-D). In contrast, the water column in May 2017 was dominated by relatively warm (2-4.8 C) and saline (34.6-34.8) Atlantic Water. Water in the bathymetric depressions was slightly colder (2.3-2.8 C) and therefore classified as Transformed Atlantic Water (Fig. 2E-H). In June 2016, the bottom water was composed of Transformed Atlantic Water (lowest temperature 2.3 C) at the gas flare area (southern part of the western N-S transect) and within the bathymetric depressions, while we found warmer Atlantic Water (3-5 C) in the upper water column. Both water masses were characterized by salinities of 34.6-34.9 (Fig. 2I-K). A strong stratification was observed in July 2015 (Fig. 2L-O). At the bottom of the water column, specifically in bathymetric depressions, water was saline and relatively warm Atlantic Water (34.9, ~3.5 C) with fractions of Transformed Atlantic Water admixture. At the main gas flare   In June 2016, Isfjorden surface waters down to 40 m were considerably fresher and warmer (34.2, 4.7 C) than in May 2016, most likely due to freshening through melting of glaciers, snow and sea ice and heating from the atmosphere (Fig. S1B).Compared to Isfjorden in June 2016, a similar structuring of the water column was observed outside Bellsundet. In late June, surface temperatures were ~4 C, heated up by the atmosphere and surface salinities of 34.3-34.65 indicate the influence of Arctic Water, carried by the East Spitsbergen Current. Similarly, at Outer Hornsund, southwards from Bellsundet, surface salinity was not higher than 34.6, indicating the presence of Arctic Water transported by the East Spitsbergen Current (Fig. S1B).",False,False,False,

The entire water column was CH 4 oversaturated with respect to the atmospheric equilibrium concentration, which is ~3 nM at the ambient salinity and temperature conditions (Wiesenburg and Guinasso (1979) (Table S2). In the area west of Prins Karls Forland, we observed CH 4 plumes with concentrations of up to 437 nM. High concentrations were mainly encountered in bottom waters within the flare cluster, most dominantly in the southwest of the sampling grid, but the extent of the plumes differed greatly between the surveys (Figs. 3, S2). For example, we found elevated CH 4 concentrations extending widely from west to east in May 2017 (Fig. 3E-H) and June 2016 (Fig. 3I-K). In contrast, the eastward extension was less pronounced in May 2016 (Fig. 3A-D) and a clearly defined CH 4 plume was located at the intersection of the southern W-E and the western N-S transect (Fig. 3B,C).Nevertheless, the mean content of dissolved CH 4 in the water column was similar when comparing the different surveys (3483, 3547, and 3745 μmol m -2 in May 2016, May 2017, and July 2015, respectively) (Table 2, Fig. S2). In June 2016, the mean content of dissolved CH 4 reached 5644 μmol m -2 due to the reduced number of stations (12 out of 64 stations) that were sampled during this survey, and that many of the sampled stations were located above active flares (see sampling strategy), which in turn translated to higher mean values (see the calculated mean content of dissolved CH 4 for the reduced number of stations for all surveys in Table S2). Therefore, dissolved CH 4 values from June 2016 are not directly comparable to values from the other surveys.In general, CH 4 concentrations were highest in bottom waters, translating to inventories that were also highest at the Bottom Water Layer (2127-2867 μmol m -2 ) compared to the Intermediate (795-1008 μmol m -2 ) and Surface Water Layer (83-412 μmol m -2 ) (Table 2).",False,True,False,

846,10.1002/lno.11731,22,True,"Community beta diversity analysis revealed the time of sampling (sampling campaign) as one dominant factor shaping the bacterial community composition (envfit, p ≤ 0.05). The dissimilarity of the bacterial community was particular apparent in samples retrieved in May 2016 (spring) compared to samples from June 2016 and July 2015 (late spring/summer; Fig. 7A). In addition to the sampling campaign, water depth was a second variable that significantly correlated with community dissimilarity (p ≤ 0.05). To reduce the masking of seasonal effects on the beta diversity analysis, we subsequently focused on samples retrieved from single sampling campaigns. Here, water temperature and depth, both independent environmental variables, influenced the communities (p ≤ 0.05). Since these factors/variables (together with salinity) also define the classification of water masses (see section Hydrographic setting), water masses are indicated in Fig. 7B-D. In June 2016 and July 2015, communities revealed similarities according to water masses (Fig. 7C,D). Analogously, medium or high active MOB communities were more similar to one another. At Isfjorden and Outer Bellsundet, where water mass properties were highly affected by local features, communities were distinctively different to most of the other communities found at the shelf west off Prins Karls Forland, especially in June 2016 (Fig. 7C).Supplementing NMDS-based analysis, we conducted canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Similar to NMDS, CCA also indicated that water temperature, depth, and salinity significantly influenced the community composition (Table 3).

Hydrographical parameters (salinity, temperature, pressure), concentration of dissolved CH 4 and MOx activity were repeatedly measured at Stas. 9,16,31,44,54, and 64 over a 2-day time period (Table S1). Water mass properties only showed marginal differences (Fig. S8A,D).

The shallow shelf west off Prins Karls Forland is characterized by numerous gas flares at the ridge of the Forlandet moraine complex as well as the many bathymetric depressions extending eastwards from the moraine. The water column at the shallow shelf is a hydrographically complex and dynamic system with seasonal variations in water mass properties. Individual gas flares transport differential amounts of CH 4 into the water column, and total CH 4 flux on the shelf also varies over time (Silyakova et al. 2020). However, a seasonal connection with high CH 4 fluxes during the warm season and ~80% lower fluxes during cold bottom water conditions, as found at the shelf break below 360 m water depth (Ferré et al. 2020), is not evident on the shallow shelf, where active flare clusters occur at 90 m. Such a depth is far above the uppermost limit of the shifting gas hydrate stability zone, which was found to be in between 380 and 400 m water depth (Berndt et al. 2014). We repeatedly investigated the shallow shelf over a time period of 3 years covering the Arctic spring (May 2016(May , 2017)), late spring (June 2016) and summer (July 2015) and their specific hydrographic conditions. Our study reveals the activity, distribution and structure of methane-oxidizing communities in the water column on the shallow shelf west of Svalbard.",False,True,False,

Moreover, the total content of dissolved CH 4 in the area (423 km 2 ) is consistent with values of ~13 × 10 5 mol area -1 in spring (May 2016/17) and summer (July 2015). The seemingly high total CH 4 content in late spring (June 2016) is caused by an under-sampling of the survey area (see section Water column methane content and Study area and Sampling strategy).Our values from May 2016/17 and July 2015, together with previously published flux data (Silyakova et al. 2020), indicate comparably steady CH 4 inputs in our study area during the investigated seasons. In contrast, seep activity in deeper water levels at the shelf break are strongly reduced during times with low bottom water temperatures (Ferré et al. 2020), because the uprising CH 4 ""freezes out"" as gas hydrate in surface sediments, building up a seasonal gas hydrate capacitor that is reduced in summer.Moreover, our repeated sampling over the short time period of 2 days in May 2016 showed negligible variations in CH 4 concentration and water mass properties (Fig. S8A,D), and neither the bacterial MOx activity (Fig. S8C,F) nor the community composition (Fig. 6B) revealed any remarkable differences between the two time points. These findings indicate that hydrographic and biogeochemical variations during one sampling of the entire grid were most probably low (Steinle et al. 2015).",False,True,False,
851,10.1002/lno.11731,27,True,"## Spatiotemporal variations of methane oxidation activity
Methane oxidation in the ocean is the final sink for dissolved CH 4 before its release into the atmosphere (e.g., Reeburgh 2007;Steinle et al. 2015). Previous studies report that elevated MOx activity in marine environments is related to high CH 4 concentrations (Valentine et al. 2001;Mau et al. 2013;Crespo-Medina et al. 2014;Steinle et al. 2015). In our study, we also found elevated MOx rates in methane-rich bottom waters. But in the CH 4 plumes, MOx was not substantially elevated (Figs. S2, S3). This has been found elsewhere, too (Crespo-Medina et al. 2014;Steinle et al. 2015Steinle et al. , 2017)), and a literature review only revealed a correlation of MOx and CH 4 contents on logarithmic scales (James et al. 2016). The rather loose dependency of MOx and CH 4 concentrations indicates that microbial community abundance, and possibly other factors such as the availability of micronutrients, seems at least equally important in determining the efficacy of the microbial CH 4 filter in the water column (Steinle et al. 2015).",False,False,False,
852,10.1002/lno.11731,28,True,"Our study area is characterized by steady CH 4 contents between seasons, but similarly to the spatial variation of MOx within one sampling campaign, we found large seasonal differences in MOx activity. In the Arctic spring (May) and late spring (June), MOx rates were generally low (weighted mean: < 2.02 μmol m -2 d -1 ; total MOx: < 736 mol d -1 ; Table 2). In contrast, in summer (July), MOx in the entire area was about one order of magnitude higher (weighted mean: 27.54 μmol m -2 d -1 ; total MOx: 10,024 mol d -1 ). It is also noteworthy that the maximum MOx value measured in summer (July; 7.2 nM d -1 ) was much higher compared to previous measurements conducted in the area around Svalbard. Steinle et al. (2015) measured MOx rates of up to 3.2 nM d -1 at the continental slope west of our study area in Arctic summer (August). Mau et al. (2017) published rates of up to 2.2 nM d -1 in a CH 4 plume located more southerly between Hornsundbanken and Isfjordbanken west of Spitsbergen from the same season (August/September).",False,True,False,
853,10.1002/lno.11731,29,True,"We discovered that the capacity of MOx shows a high spatiotemporal variation. The high MOx rate in summer translates to a turnover time of the CH 4 inventory of the entire sampling grid (13.63 × 10 5 mol) of about 136 d. In contrast, the turnover time was substantially longer in spring (1754-6777 d). While MOx plays a substantial role in retaining CH 4 in the Arctic summer, it seems of rather lower importance in winter. Similar seasonal differences were also found at the shelf break west of our study area (Steinle et al. 2015;Ferré et al. 2020). In general, the turnover times at the Prins Karls Forland shelf are within the intermediately high to low range when compared to previously reported turnover times of weeks to a few years from methane-rich, Arctic waters (Mau et al. 2013;Steinle et al. 2015;James et al. 2016). Turnover times of several decades are rare and typically restricted to oceanic deep waters with very low CH 4 contents (< 10 nM) (Rehder et al. 1999;Heeschen et al. 2003;James et al. 2016).  1B) and water levels (1: 5 m above seafloor, 3: 25 m above seafloor, 5: Intermediate water level, 8: 5 m below sea surface, I: Isfjorden, XI: Outer Belsundet).

855,10.1002/lno.11731,31,True,"The first scenario is characterized by a water column dominated by Atlantic Water as it was typically the case in summer (July; Fig. 2L-O). Atlantic Water episodically floods the shallow shelf in the form of numerous eddies caused by the West Spitsbergen Current that meanders eastwards onto the shelf (Nilsen et al. 2008;Steinle et al. 2015). The dense Atlantic Water replaces the shelf water, less saline (though colder) Arctic Water brought by the East Spitsbergen Current, and fills up the bathymetric depressions (Silyakova et al. 2020). This phenomenon was particularly apparent at the eastern end of the southern W-E transect, where the depressions are 40 m deeper than the surrounding seafloor. There, we found hot spots of MOx activity with 2-3 times higher rates than those reported previously from the continental shelf around Svalbard (Mau et al. 2013;Gentz et al. 2014;Steinle et al. 2015Steinle et al. , 2017) ) although CH 4 concentrations were only moderately high in the depressions compared to gas flare locations in the western part of the sampling grid (Figs. S2, S3). Prior to flooding the shelf, Atlantic Water has an offshore history where CH 4 concentrations are low (Steinle et al. 2015). When swept over the CH 4 seeps at the shelf break (i.e., west of the study area), Atlantic Water becomes charged with CH 4 , but MOx rates in the water column are initially low because of the initially low MOB content in this water mass (Steinle et al. 2015). When reaching the depressions, methane-enriched Atlantic Water becomes trapped as these depressions provide a sheltered environment with long residence times.

Mixing is furthermore responsible for the dispersion of dissolved CH 4 . Meandering of the West Spitsbergen Current, flooding and flushing of the shallow shelf occur more often in winter and spring (von Appen et al. 2016;Silyakova et al. 2020). Moreover, the upwelling of Atlantic Water onto the shelf and into fjords in winter enhances the mixing of Transformed Atlantic Water and Local Water that reside there (Cottier et al. 2007). Arctic Water, often together with sea ice floes, both transported with the East Spitsbergen Current from the Northern Barents Sea (Nilsen et al. 2016) additionally contribute to the residing water mass replacement. The frequent mixing does not provide stable conditions for microbial community development. In other words, the short residence times and the frequent exchange of water masses in the bathymetric depressions with water masses containing only low amounts of MOB leads to an overall low abundance of water column MOB and thus MOx activity, which is less effective in retaining CH 4 . In contrast, the CH 4 charged water masses are transported away from the CH 4 point sources and disperse in the lee of the seep (Graves et al. 2015). Consequently, we only observed low MOx activity in spring (Fig. 4A-H).",False,True,False,

We evaluated the methanotrophic and other methylotrophic communities in bottom water level from stations located at the shelf west off Prins Karls Forland (Stas. 9, 10, 49, 54, and 58), Isfjorden (I) and Outer Bellsundet (XI), which were collected in the Arctic spring and late spring (May and June), and summer (July). These samples were selected for pmoA gene amplicon sequencing because of their elevated MOx rates, which suggested the presence of active MOB.The prevalent members of the MOB community in all samples, and irrespective of the water mass, were dominated by Type Ia deep-sea 3 MOB (OPU1) with variable but minor shares of Type Ia deep-sea 1 MOB (OPU2; Fig. 5B). OPU1 shares 98% sequence similarity with an uncultured MOB from the water column above the Oregon seep system at Hydrate Ridge (sequence FJ858282, GenBank; Hansman et al. (2017); Fig. S6). OPU2 shares 92% sequence similarity with Methyloprofundus sedimenti (sequence KF484908; Tavormina et al. (2015); relating to the family level, Yarza et al. (2014)), which is a known obligate MOB of the family Methylomonaceae, isolated from marine surface sediment from Monterey Canyon off the coast of California (USA) (Fig. S6). Both, the deep-sea 1 and 3 subgroups, mainly constitute mesophilic uncultured MOB from marine and freshwater environments (Lüke and Frenzel 2011;Knief 2015;Hansman et al. 2017). Our data show that a higher percentage of Type Ia deep-sea 3 MOB (OPU1) was found in Atlantic Water and Atlantic Water/Transformed Atlantic Water, i.e., the water mass prevailing in the bathymetric depressions where we also found high MOx activities.

The presence of OTUs related to Methyloprofundus sp. and Milano-WF1B-03, the two most abundant MOB in the 16S rRNA data set, coincide with the locations of MOx hot spots-in the depression in summer (July) and above CH 4 flares in spring (May) (Fig. 6C,D). OTUs related to the known methylotrophs (Methylophagaceae: Methylophaga and Methylophilaceae: Methylotenera and OM43 clade), which are present in all of our samples, were frequently found in marine and freshwater ecosystems where they profit from C1-compounds, such as methanol and methylamine, released as a product of methane monooxygenase activity of MOB (Neufeld et al. 2007(Neufeld et al. , 2008;;Moussard et al. 2009).

858,10.1002/lno.11731,34,True,"We also identified high abundances of sequences affiliated with Verrucomicrobia (Fig. 6B). Members of this phylum have been found globally in a variety of aerobic and anaerobic marine environments (Freitas et al. 2012), but only a few species were isolated and characterized so far, and relatively little knowledge exists on the metabolic capabilities of Verrucomicrobia. We found members of the family Rubritaleaceae genus Luteolibacter, which are highly abundant in samples associated with high MOx activity (July 2015, primarily in the bottom water level; Fig. 6B). Luteolibacter comprises six known species that are described as chemoheterotrophs utilizing a variety of carbon sources (Zhang et al. 2017). None of them has been tested for MOx activity and to the best of our knowledge, no genome data from this genus are available. Yet, some other members of the Verrucomicrobia (""Ca. Methylacidimicrobium,"" ""Ca. Methylacidiphilum kamchatkense"" strain Kam1, V4 and SolV) were found to mediate MOx (Dunfield et al. 2007;Pol et al. 2007;Kruse et al. 2019). Methanotrophic Verrucomicrobia have multiple operons encoding the particulate methane monooxygenase with identical pmoCAB operon structure when compared to proteobacterial MOB (Op den Camp et al. 2009). However, despite the similar operon structure, no standard pmoA primer set can amplify verrucomicrobial pmoA genes, which seems to be only detectable by shot-gun genome sequencing (Dunfield et al. 2007;Pol et al. 2007). As a result, the abundance, distribution and diversity of Verrucomicrobia MOB has been overlooked in most ecological studies (Bergmann et al. 2011). We did not detect any Verrucomicrobia-related species with our pmoA sequencing approach and although the obvious co-occurrence of Luteolibacter sp. (class Verrucomicrobia) with high MOx rates shown here is remarkable, we can only speculate if the Luteolibacter at the Prins Karls Forland shelf are involved in MOx (directly or indirectly) or if their abundance maximum is related to factors that are independent of CH 4 -dynamics.",False,False,False,
859,10.1002/lno.11731,35,True,"## Origin of methane-oxidizing bacteria
The meandering of the West Spitsbergen Current causes occasional flooding events of the shallow shelf at Prins Karls Forland with Atlantic Water (Steinle et al. 2015;Silyakova et al. 2020). Because of the general south-north direction of the West Spitsbergen Current, it thus seems likely that the residual Atlantic Water that we found in the bathymetric depressions in summer had, before being trapped in the bathymetric depressions, passed our southern stations, i.e., Outer Bellsundet, Outer Hornsund, and Sørkappøya. At these stations, we found elevated CH 4 concentrations around seeps, which were discovered along the Svalbard margin (Mau et al. 2017). Furthermore, we found high similarities between the MOB communities found at the shallow shelf offshore Prins Karls Forland and at the southern stations (Fig. 5A). For example, the MOB communities at Stas. 49, 54 and 58 (all offshore Prins Karls Forland) in summer (July 2015) comprise more than 90% of Type Ia deep-sea 3 MOB, just like the MOB community at Outer Bellsundet in late spring (June 2016; Fig. 5B). The bottom water layers of all southern stations were characterized by the influence of warm and saline Atlantic Water (similar to the bathymetric depressions offshore Prins Karls Forland in the summer). Wilkins et al. (2013) suggested that the advection of microorganisms originating from upstream-locations, which then colonize sites downstream, shape the microbial community at the downstream locations. It also appears that increasing opportunities for colonization (and subsequent growth) are more relevant than the numbers of transported organisms. Translated to our study, this converts into the following: the microbes from Outer Bellsundet (upstream site) colonize the shelf west of Prins Karls Forland (downstream site). The specific hydrographic setting at the downstream site, i.e., sheltered conditions comprising CH 4 and nutrient-rich water that is trapped in the depressions due to flooding events and strong stratification of the water column in summer allows MOB communities to develop. These factors are then also more important than the sheer number of MOB cells being transported from the southern stations to the Prins Karls Forland shelf. Moreover, the inoculation theory leads to the assumption that the blooming MOB community from the Prins Karls Forland shelf could be in turn an inoculum for other ""MOx systems"" further north, and that seeding and inoculation via water mass transport is an important vector connecting spatially separated habitats (Wilkins et al. 2013).",False,False,False,
860,10.1002/lno.11731,36,True,"## Conclusion
Spatiotemporal changes in MOx activity and MOB community structure in the water column above CH 4 seeps at the shallow shelf west of Svalbard are primarily a consequence of the seasonal variations of the hydrographical regimes. The two different scenarios presented in this study clearly show that seasonality strongly affects the MOB community structures and MOx capacity. Moreover, the distribution of MOB communities along the shallow shelf is most likely caused by physical transport, while site-specific geomorphological characteristics such as the shallow Forlandet moraine complex featuring numerous bathymetric depressions, enhance this effect. We suggest that the origin of the initial MOB ""inoculum"" in the bathymetric depressions offshore Prins Karls Forland might originate from seep regions further south. Once the MOB are trapped in bathymetric depressions, they are more sheltered from rapidly changing and dynamic conditions of the upper water column. Such sheltered conditions promote community growth, which in turn results in elevated MOx in summertime. Seasonality (especially in winter and spring, when the water column is subjected to deep mixing) is profoundly under-represented in studies on microbial habitat structure in Arctic water column habitats. Systematic timeseries measurements covering the different, including harsh/ bad weather seasons, would allow for a more comprehensive understanding of biogeochemical processes influenced by seasonal change-related microbial community variations. This would further improve our qualitative and quantitative understanding of important microbial processes in a warming Arctic Ocean.### Fig 1 .**Caption:** Fig 1.

## Abstract
Functional traits are increasingly used to assess changes in phytoplankton community structure and to link individual characteristics to ecosystem functioning. However, they are usually inferred from taxonomic identification or manually measured for each organism, both time consuming approaches. Instead, we focus on high throughput imaging to describe the main temporal variations of morphological changes of phytoplankton in Narragansett Bay, a coastal time-series station. We analyzed a 2-yr dataset of morphological features automatically extracted from continuous imaging of individual phytoplankton images ($ 105 million images collected by an Imaging FlowCytobot). We identified synthetic morphological traits using multivariate analysis and revealed that morphological variations were mainly due to changes in length, width, shape regularity, and chain structure. Morphological changes were especially important in winter with successive peaks of larger cells with increasing complexity and chains more clearly connected. Small nanophytoplankton were present year-round and constituted the base of the community, especially apparent during the transitions between diatom blooms. High inter-annual variability was also observed. On a weekly timescale, increases in light were associated with more clearly connected chains while more complex shapes occurred at lower nitrogen concentrations. On an hourly timescale, temperature was the determinant variable constraining cell morphology, with a general negative influence on length and a positive one on width, shape regularity, and chain structure. These first insights into the phytoplankton morphology of Narragansett Bay highlight the possible morphological traits driving the phytoplankton succession in response to light, temperature, and nutrient changes.Morphology is the first characteristic we notice in any organism, whether it is a human, a cat, a shellfish, or a microorganism. Cell morphology is also a primary criterion to classify unicellular organisms like phytoplankton into species, both with light microscopy and from continuous imagery. Phytoplankton are unicellular and colonial photosynthetic",False,False,False,

microorganisms that account for approximately half of Earth's primary productivity (Field et al. 1998). Their morphology directly affects their fitness through its impact on nutrient acquisition, light perception, cell division, defense against grazing by herbivores, and buoyancy (Litchman and Klausmeier 2008;Naselli-Flores and Barone 2011;Marañ on 2015). Morphological characteristics are, as such, functional traits that can impact growth, reproduction, and survival (Litchman and Klausmeier 2008;Martini et al. 2021). Although hard to measure and to define in a universal way, cell size is considered a master trait among functional traits. In two dimensions, it can be estimated from surface area, major axis, or perimeter, but it can also be replaced by estimations of cell volume for relative abundances (e.g. : Hillebrand et al. 1999), more accurate for biomass and carbon analyses. Cell size is a well-defined metric in microscopy but only includes the part of the cell within the cell wall; if used alone, it thus occults the more complex morphological characteristics. Extensions and protuberances, for instance, play a major role in modulating the sinking velocity of phytoplankton (Naselli-Flores et al. 2020), and an increase in size will affect differently the sinking velocity of an elongated or a spherical cell (Durante et al. 2019). At sub-saturating light, elongated cells also have higher growth than spherical or ellipsoidal ones, likely due to a better exposition of chloroplasts (Naselli-Flores and Barone 2011).",False,False,False,
878,10.1002/lno.12171,2,True,"Differences in morphological characteristics drive the classification of phytoplankton into different phyla, families, genera, and species. Traditionally, water was collected with bottles or plankton nets and later analyzed under light microscopy, marking the creation of the first long-term plankton time series. Imaging devices have improved our capacity to monitor phytoplankton on broader temporal and spatial scales using automatic classification (Irisson et al. 2022) but the focus remains on using the morphology to infer the taxonomy. The degree of precision at the taxonomic level can also differ widely between datasets depending on both the quality of the annotated images and the algorithm used for classification. Obtaining accurate data both with light microscopy and imagery thus requires time and taxonomic expertise, and the ecological interpretation of the data relies on the quality of the identification. However, since morphology is the main criteria for discriminating taxa, it also holds, by itself, important additional ecological value independent from the quality of the taxonomic information.",False,False,False,
879,10.1002/lno.12171,3,True,"Morphological analysis reduces high-dimensional datasets of multiple species to a few selected morphological traits characteristic of the community. By taking into account functional redundancy among taxa, it groups species with similar features without reducing the ecological information (Abonyi et al. 2018). Simplifying phytoplankton communities to a set of common functional traits also enables comparing environments based on phytoplankton functional roles in the ecosystems even when species might differ (Salmaso et al. 2015). Freshwater phytoplankton morpho-based classifications, for instance, can be better explained by environmental variables than phylogenetic and species-based classifications (Kruk et al. 2011). Here, we investigate cell morphology that can now be automatically studied using high throughput imaging systems. Imaging devices such as the CytoSense (Cytobuoy b. v., Dubelaar et al. 2000) or the Imaging FlowCytobot (IFCB, Olson and Sosik 2007) combine flow cytometry and imagery, targeting phytoplankton populations respectively from < 1 μm up to 4 mm (CytoSense) and from $ 10 to 150 μm (IFCB). For each image, associated software (e.g., CytoClus for the CytoSense) or open-source processing codes (Sosik and Olson 2007, for the IFCB) provide easy, fast, reliable, and quantitative measurements of cell morphological features. For example, Fragoso et al. (2019) used eight morphological features derived from discrete water samples analyzed with a CytoSense to characterize trait variability of phytoplankton and plastid ciliates in the subpolar North Atlantic. Dunker (2020) combined taxonomic and morphological information from discrete samples run with an ImageStream ® X Mk II to characterize the seasonal changes of cyanobacteria and green algae in a pond. In parallel to the recent development of these instruments, several morphology-based approaches, mainly in freshwater ecosystems, have been developed to estimate the functional and morphological heterogeneity of phytoplanktonic communities (Weithoff and Beisner 2019). Focusing on freshwater phytoplankton, Reynolds et al. (2002) formalized decades of studies of functional groups into 31 associations of organisms sharing similar morphological features, habitats, or tolerances to nitrogen, light and carbon. On the other hand, Kruk et al. (2010) focused on morphology and developed morphology-based functional groups using traits determined from microscopy including volume, surface area, maximum linear dimension, aerotopes, flagella, mucilage, heterocysts, and siliceous exoskeletal structures. These approaches, developed for freshwater lakes, have paved the way for automated and solely morphological approaches for marine phytoplankton. However, they either make a detour through inferring morphological features from taxonomy, require time consuming light microscopy measurements, or include parameters that are not as easily detectable by imagery and automatic classification (e.g., mucilage, flagella), reducing the possible application to large temporal and spatial scales.",False,False,False,
880,10.1002/lno.12171,4,True,"Narragansett Bay has been studied via weekly sampling since 1959 and the general taxonomical seasonal pattern is thus well known, offering a knowledge foundation to build upon and expand towards morphology. This coastal estuary is characterized by diatom domination in winter-spring and late summer months and flagellate domination in late spring-early summer and autumn (Pratt 1959). The winter-spring bloom supports fast-growing species with sizes greater than 20 μm and consists in the succession of different populations; a dominant taxon, morphologically similar or not, replacing one another within a few weeks (Gowen et al. 2012). Karentz and Smayda (1998) detailed the succession, starting with winter species with low temperatures for optimal growth such as Thalassiosira nordenskioeldii and Detonula confervacea, moving to spring species such as Leptocylindrus danicus, often highest in abundance in May, then to summer species like Heterosigma akashiwo and Prorocentrum sp., motile and occurring at higher temperatures, and eventually fall species such as Thalassiosira rotula. Other important species can have both a warm-water and cold-water peak (e.g., Skeletonema costatum and Rhizosolenia setigera) or may, in the case of Asterionellopsis glacialis certain years, dominate the population almost every month except during the summer.All species mentioned above have common morphological characteristics as well as unique features that can be captured by IFCB images (Fig. 1). Looking only at morphology, we might expect similar signals in elongation from communities dominated by chain-diatoms, while the width and shape of individual cells would allow for the taxonomic differentiation. Diatoms also tend to decrease in size throughout their life cycle due to asexual reproduction (Amato et al. 2005).",False,False,False,
881,10.1002/lno.12171,5,True,"## Sonnet et al. Phytoplankton morphological succession
Therefore, as one dominant chain-diatom replaces the other during the winter-spring blooms, there might be a small decrease in size. If dominant, species such as Chaetoceros spp. or A. glacialis should increase measures of perimeter and complexity due to their structure, spines, or setae while cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, and flagellates, on the contrary, would be expected to have a more homogeneous shape. Approaching these signals by the prism of morphology allows us to focus on the changes that are significant for the community. For instance, the replacement of a chain-diatom dominated population by another chain-diatom may not affect the predator-prey relationship of phytoplankton with zooplankton. Dominant phytoplankton groups are highly variable from 1 yr to the next, it is thus difficult to identify recurring yearly patterns in taxonomy. On the other hand, the morphological succession and functional role in the ecosystem may remain the same if taxa are replaced by others with a similar morphology (Gowen et al. 2012). By considering the whole community, we avoid focusing on only a small number of species selected based on their abundance-a possible bias towards bloom periods with high abundances-and include cells like nanophytoplankton, which are harder to detect and enumerate via light microscopy.",False,False,False,

Based on the winter-spring bloom usually detected with taxonomic analysis, we hypothesize that diatoms, and specifically chains, would dominate the morphological signal in winter and spring with consistent domination of elongated communities throughout this period. There may however be more changes in other morphological characteristics due to other differences between the successively dominant chain species and as environmental conditions change. On the contrary, we hypothesize that summer would show a very different morphological signal mainly dominated by smaller organisms. To study these variations of the morphological signal, we use morphological features automatically extracted from individual cell images collected using an IFCB at a coastal time-series station over a 2-yr period. Using multivariate analysis, we create a morphological space capturing the main morphological variations of phytoplanktonic cells. Finally, we characterize the temporal dynamics of phytoplankton morphology within this morphological space in relation to environmental changes.",False,False,False,

## Sampling
Water samples were continuously collected at the University of Rhode Island, Graduate School of Oceanography Pier (GSO Pier, total depth: 2 m, Lat: 41.4923, Lon: À71.1489, 11 November 2017 to 30 October 2019) using an IFCB. This station is located on the west shore of a temperate and shallow estuary, Narragansett Bay, on the northeast coast of the United States (Fig. 2). Narragansett Bay is New England's largest estuary and a populated area subject to anthropogenic pressures (Roman et al. 2000;Narragansett Bay National Estuarine Research Reserve 2009). The Bay is well mixed with similar salinity and nutrient concentration at the bottom and surface. Nutrients peak in fall and are close to depletion in springsummer (Heffner 2009). Large islands complexify the circulation of water masses in the southern half of the Bay with the water flowing in through the East passage and out the West passage even though deeper water may also flow north in or out of the Bay depending on the tides (Kincaid et al. 2008).## Phytoplankton imaging
The IFCB combines a flow cytometer and a camera to record images of phytoplankton between 10 and 150 μm (Olson and Sosik 2007). The water is pumped from 1.5 m deep into a small research building located on the pier and filtered with 400 and 150 μm screens before entering the IFCB. Triggered by fluorescence, the instrument records a file of images approximately every 20 min and 236 image descriptors are automatically measured for each individual image (Sosik and Olson 2007, https://github.com/hsosik/ifcb-analysis/wiki) (Fig. 3).",False,False,False,
884,10.1002/lno.12171,8,True,"## Environmental variables
Environmental parameters were compiled from two locations (Fig. 2). Temperature and salinity were continuously measured at 15-min intervals at the GSO Pier by the Narragansett Bay Fixed-Site Monitoring Network (NBFSMN, contact: Heather Stoffel) and nutrients (silica, phosphate and nitrogen) were measured weekly at the same location by the Marine Ecosystems Research Lab (Reed andOviatt, 1976-2019, Marine Ecosystems Research Laboratory) Solar radiation was measured every 5 min in Kingston, west of the Pier, by the U.S. Climate Reference Network (https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/  uscrn/products/subhourly01/).## Morphological analysis
The morphological analysis of the phytoplankton images involved three steps (Fig. 4): data preprocessing, dimension reduction to define morphological traits, and time series analysis.   and Olson 2007). The blobs are the organisms detected on the image (i.e., white part of the black and white image), it can be a single cell or several cells depending on the morphology.

885,10.1002/lno.12171,9,True,"## Data preprocessing
The IFCB is deployed in a flowthrough system; if the pump is not operating optimally, bubbles can lower the cell counts and eventually stop the flow. We used manual quality control to remove samples that had artifacts or bubbles. We also removed all files with less than 250 cells mL À1 and less than 250 images to exclude the files that would not accurately represent the community. Manually annotated images via the tool IFCB annotate (Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, https://ifcb-annotate.whoi.edu/) were used to create a classifier based on a Random Forest algorithm (Breiman 2001). This led to the removal of images classified as ""bubbles"", ""detritus"", ""zooplankton"", ""ciliates"", and images within the category ""unclassified"" with an area greater than 90,000 pixels to avoid nematodes or macroalgae. The removal of these classes allowed for keeping all images classified as phytoplankton, that is, 68,539,385 images of the 104,613,040 initial images set for 26,720 samples. A simple classifier with very few broad classes can also be used when no previous classification is available. The classification mentioned above was later used to extract species composing the greatest percentage of the community every week.Due to the redundancy of our high-frequency data and the computation cost of working with more than 68 million images, we chose to adopt a subsampling strategy to create the morphological space. We randomly chose 5% of the total samples and extracted 3, 10, 50, 100, 250, 500, and 1000 random images per sample and repeated this process 10 times to estimate how a principal component analysis (PCA; Legendre and Legendre 1998) would be affected by the number of images extracted. Considering the extent of our dataset and the desire to also capture rare events, we chose to subsample 250 images per sample since the variation between replicates converged with this sample size and no greater value was gained by sampling 500 or 1000 images (see Supporting Information Figs. S1, S2). This corresponds to 6,680,000 images for 26,720 samples.",False,False,False,

We used 45 morphological features (see Supporting Information Table S1) of the 6,680,000 subsampled phytoplankton individual images to define a morphological space using multivariate analyses in an approach similar to the one used for copepods by Vilgrain et al. (2021). Among the 236 image descriptors that were automatically calculated on each image by the MATLAB ® routine, the 45 features selected were important in describing the whole cells and not only part of the image, hence having ecological importance. They correspond to the size, volume, symmetry, texture, shape, colony, and chain measures. This includes, among others, area, convex area, major axis, minor axis, circularity, the ratio of perimeter over major axis, levels of gray, number of blobs detected on the image (see Supporting Information Table S1 for a full list and definitions).

The interest of multivariate analysis such as PCA resides in the reduction of complex data into a small number of composite axes correlated with the original variables but orthogonal, thus independent from each other. However, the PCA gives more weight to the most extreme values even if they are extremely rare. To avoid giving an out-of-proportion weight to very extreme but very rare morphologies and to better represent the most abundant morphologies, we chose to implement an observation-weighted PCA using the concentration of the samples as weight. The weight was calculated by Eq. (1) with N s the number of images in the sample, 0.25 mL min À1 the flow speed, runTime the time the sample was run, and inhibitTime the time the IFCB was writing images to the disk and not recording.The significant axes of the observation-weighted PCA were determined using Cattel's scree test, also called the visual elbow method (Cattell 1966, see Supporting Information Fig. S3), and used as new synthetic morphological traits. To obtain the full picture of the community for every sample, we used the singular value decomposition matrix from the PCA to reproject every one of the 68,539,385 images into our morphological space.

We used a Wilcoxon test of comparison of means to compare the inter-annual seasonal variability of each of the morphological traits. To explore the potential relationships between morphological traits and environment variables on a weekly time scale we ran a redundancy analysis (RDA; Legendre and Legendre 1998) with light, salinity, temperature, nitrogen, phosphate, and silicate as explanatory variables. The RDA, similarly to the PCA, creates composite axes that are orthogonal to each other and represent the variance explained by the environmental variables. Going down to a finer time scale, at the hourly level, we used Bayesian DLM (West and Harrison 1997) to explore how these relationships between morphology and environment may change over time. In a DLM, environmental parameters can be either static (as in a regular linear regression model) or dynamic, with regression coefficients changing over time. DLMs are especially suitable for complex time series as they can handle non-stationary processes and missing observations (Laine 2020). DLMs are represented as a system of two equations: the observational equation, modeling the time series with static and dynamic parameters, and the evolution equation, controlling how the dynamic parameters change over time. The observations Y t were modeled as dependent of S t , a seasonal component, Z t , a set of covariates whose vector of regression coefficients β does not change over time, F t , a set of covariates (including a dynamic intercept) with dynamic regression coefficients x t , and ν t the observation error:
The dynamic intercept and the observation error bring additional information on top of the covariates: the former is the value of the response when all the other predictors are equal to zero while the latter measures the component not captured by the model.

All dynamic components were normalized and modeled with random walks as we expect the regression coefficients to be similar to their value at the previous time. The dynamic regression coefficients x t were estimated from the evolution equation below:
where G t is the matrix of evolutions coefficients and ω t is a Gaussian evolution error.Although DLM parameter estimation is often carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms, here we used a more recent and faster approach based on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) (Rue et al. 2009;Ruiz-C ardenas et al. 2012).

## Morphological space
The three first axes of the PCA were significant and represented 76.9% of the morphological variations of the phytoplankton cells (Fig. 5). We also considered the 4 th axis for its ecological significance as it allows us to differentiate between chain structures. The 1 st axis of the morphological space (PC1, 46.2% of the variance) corresponded to elongation. It was driven by the measures of major axis length, cell perimeter, and the different measures related to the surface area, hence separating longer and bigger cells (PC1 > 0) from smaller ones (PC1 < 0). The 2 nd axis (PC2, 21.4% of the variance) represented the cell width. It was mainly driven by the minor axis length and the ratio of area over perimeter, both characteristics of the width of the cells, hence separating more circular and wider cells (PC2 > 0) from narrower cells (PC2 < 0). The biovolume and area contributed to both PC1 and PC2; while the area was more correlated with PC1, biovolume was more correlated with PC2. The 3 rd axis (PC3, 9.3% of the variance) represented cell shape complexity or regularity. It separated cells with a simple shape (PC3 > 0), that is, regular cells having a high ratio of convex perimeter over perimeter, generally good symmetry (low Hausdorff distances after rotation), and a small difference between the area and the convex or bounding box area (high solidity and high extent), from cells with complex shape (PC3 < 0) with a high ratio of perimeter over major axis. Eventually, the 4 th axis (PC4, 4.1% of variance) is more complex to interpret but, when interpreted in conjunction with PC1, can help differentiate chain structures. It is mainly driven by the median distance between points along the perimeter and the number of blobs that can be detected on each image, which corresponds to the number of different enough entities for the processing software to consider them as different cells. Both of these measures, although in opposite directions along the PC4 axis, can be seen as chains structure measurements: very elongated and thin chains with little difference between the cells (e.g., Leptocylindrus minimus) will have a very high median distance between points along their perimeter but most likely will not be detected as several blobs while chains with very distinct chloroplasts (e.g., Skeletonema sp.) or connected by threads (e.g., Thalassiosira sp.) are likely to have more than one blob detected and thus have more negative values along PC4. When PC1 values are high, meaning organisms are elongated, PC4 can be used to differentiate the average chain structure.

The temporal evolution of the four main axes of the morphological space, that is, the main morphological traits characterizing the phytoplankton community, revealed complex successions of morphologically different communities (Fig. 6) and contrasted seasonal and interannual patterns (Fig. 7). Contrary to our expectation, there was no clearly defined seasonal pattern for cell morphology. Instead of observing an increase in length in spring and a decrease in summer, the average phytoplankton community length (PC1) oscillated, Fig. 5.

The length was generally lower in summer, but we saw several rises over the summer in 2018 and a peak-as important as the winter peaks-in September 2019. Length was also significantly higher in 2019 (p-value < 2e-16, see Fig. 7a). Although missing values certainly increase the signal, it illustrates significant inter-annual variability and the importance of long-term time series. Cell width (PC2) significantly decreased in April 2018, coincidentally with a rise in length, as well as in late December 2018 (Fig. 6b). There might be a third major decrease in April 2019 but too many data points are missing to draw any robust conclusions. Cell shape regularity (PC3) also varied with time (Fig. 6c): phytoplankton communities generally had more regular shapes in autumn and late spring and more complex shapes in February-March and summer (Fig. 7c). PC4 does not display a general seasonal pattern but when considered during the periods of high PC1, we can see that the February 2018 length increase was coupled with a low PC4 and thus included more chains with distant cells compared to the bloom of March 2018 (Fig. 6d). Similarly, the December 2018 and February 2019 length increases had lower PC4 values than March 2019, indicating more chains with differentiated cells.There was high inter-annual variability between the years 2018 and 2019 (Fig. 7) for all the morphological traits but particularly in summer for the length and width, significantly higher in 2019 (p-value < 2e-16) and with little overlap in their distributions.

The RDA run on the weekly averages explains a significant proportion of the variance (p = 0.001, R 2 -adjusted = 0.18, Fig. 8) but only the 1 st axis, constraining 17.6% of the variance, was significant (p = 0.001). Light (p = 0.001), nitrogen (p = 0.001), silicate (p = 0.001), and, in a lower measure, temperature (p = 0.02) are the significant drivers of the RDA.Cell length is strongly negatively correlated with salinity and silicate and negatively correlated with nitrogen. Cell width and clearly connected chains are negatively correlated with silicate, nitrogen, and salinity while shape regularity is positively correlated with them but negatively correlated with light. Along the 2 nd axis, temperature is slightly negatively correlated with length and slightly positively correlated with uniform chains. Temporally, the RDA also reveals interannual variations in relation with environmental conditions, with larger and thicker cells in 2019 compared to 2018, with the addition of the coldest months of 2018 (December and January).Bayesian DLM (Fig. 9) shows that at the hourly timescale, temperature is the factor with the highest magnitude coefficients, hence the one explaining most of the variability within the morphological signal. Similar to the RDA, temperature has a general positive influence on chain structure and a negative influence on length. However, for both morphological variables, this influence seems to decrease and sometimes even reverse in summer. The clear positive influence of temperature on width throughout the time series, contrary to the absence of a relationship in the RDA, could indicate that the daily cycle might influence this morphological variable. Salinity has a general negative influence on chain structure throughout the time series and a positive one on shape regularity but only until September 2018. Light seems to be generally positively influencing width and shape regularity, indicating that a daily cycle might be significant.

Looking through the bank of images for the winter-spring 2018-2019, we can identify that the long and medium thick organisms in December 2018 are mostly driven by Skeletonema sp. and the drop in width at the end of December relates to an uptick in Leptocylindrus sp. in the community (Fig. 10). The thicker and less regular organisms observed in February 2019 are driven by Thalassiosira sp. The last peak in size in March 2019, which is slightly smaller, has similar values in width as the previous peak but less regular organisms and more uniform chains; being driven by an increase in chains of Chaetoceros spp. The nanophytoplankton are present yearround and make up a high percentage of the concentration in the samples, including in the winter-spring season, which explains the consistent decrease in elongation observed inbetween diatom blooms during this season.",False,False,False,

## Relationship between environment and phytoplankton morphology
The strongest feature of our time series resides in the deepened oscillations in length during the winter and spring compared to the summer and fall. This is accompanied by a trend to go, between peaks in elongation, from regular chains with spaced cells to clearly connected chains. This implies not only   PC2), (c) shape regularity (PC3), and (d) chain structure (PC4). The median is in gray when the credible interval at 95% (shaded area) includes 0, in red when it is positive and blue when it is negative. a higher number of chains but also that these chains are more equally spaced. They are either linked by thin threads or with chloroplasts concentrated in one part of the cell such that the junctions between cells are not defined well enough for the algorithm to detect them. This results in accurately considering that there is more than one cell on the image (e.g., difference between Skeletonema sp. and Cerataulina sp.).",False,False,False,
898,10.1002/lno.12171,22,True,"We observe that length correlates with lower salinity as winter mixing helps sustain large, non-motile cells (Stoyneva et al. 2007). Bigger organisms, whether as individual cells or chains also have an advantage against predation; data on copepods and zooplankton in Narragansett Bay show that increases in size occur right after increases in zooplankton concentration (Supporting Information Fig. S5). On the contrary, smaller phytoplankton in summer and fall are correlated with higher salinity and generally higher nutrient concentration (RDA, Fig. 8); before the blooms of long-chain diatoms deplete both silicate and nitrogen in winter-spring. Silicate shows the highest concentrations in summer and fall due to the low counts of diatoms. This occurs while nitrogen is depleted throughout the spring and summer but increases in fall before the chain diatoms blooms occur during the colder months. In summer, when turbulence is too weak to resuspend phytoplankton, smaller and buoyant cells have an advantage as they can regulate their vertical position, select for the optimal light and nutrient conditions, and avoid sinking losses (Findlay et al. 2001;Huisman et al. 2004;Strecker et al. 2004). Zohary et al. (2017) also hypothesize that this adaptation enables species to adjust their sinking velocity in different seasons since sinking velocity naturally increases with cell size. When temperature increases, changing the density and absolute viscosity of the water thus increasing the sinking velocity, it pushes phytoplankton towards smaller cell size to compensate and keep a constant sinking velocity (Naselli-Flores et al. 2020). The width, independently from the length, tends to oscillate throughout the time series and generally increases with temperature, with higher temperature seemingly favoring more circular organisms than elongated ones. Throughout the winter, the width of the longest organisms also slightly increases.",False,False,False,
899,10.1002/lno.12171,23,True,"Shape regularity oscillates throughout the time series and is high at the start of winter before slowly decreasing as nutrients also decrease. A decrease in regularity due to spines increases the form resistance factor (Walsby and Xypolyta 1977;Padis ak et al. 2003), which lowers the sinking speed of the chain diatoms throughout winter. As nutrients are taken up and decrease, cells diverging from the regular spherical shape also increase their surface area to volume ratio and, de facto, their nutrient uptake efficiency (Karp-Boss and Boss 2016). However, a reduction in size is another possibility to increase the nutrient uptake efficiency and such small cells are often more regular in shape. The nitrogen-depleted waters starting in March and especially the summer stratified waters offer thus opportunities for smaller cells as well as cells with more complex shapes, motile species, nitrogen fixers, and mixotrophic species (Litchman and Klausmeier 2008).The measure brought forward by the 4 th axis of the PCA relates to how many cells the algorithm detects on one image and how elongated they are. The same pattern occurs both in winter 2018 and 2019: as dominant chains succeed each other; the dominant chain structure also changes. Chains tend to increase as the water is cooler and less stratified (Kenitz et al. 2020), when the protection offered by a chain against predation by zooplankton might overcome the loss of efficiency in resource acquisition compared to single cells (Pahlow et al. 1997). However, the change in chain structure between different high elongation peaks is also an indication of how close the cells in the chains are to each other, either tightly linked together with many chloroplasts or, on the contrary, far apart with mainly chloroplasts in the middle of the cells or only linked by thin threads. As nutrients get depleted throughout the winter and spring, the uniformity in chains associated with size increases, showing that cells are more tightly linked with each other. A gain in surface area and thus efficiency in nutrient travel time for thin, elongated chains that are directly connected rather than linked by threads might be one of the drivers.",False,False,False,

The dynamic modeling approach applied to the hourly data shows that the relationship between environmental and morphological variables can change through time and can differ from the weekly time scale: temperature, for instance, incorporates both the tidal and daily signal and has a generally positive impact on width and chain structure and negative on elongation. The positive influence of light on width and shape regularity also at the hourly time scale confirms that there may be significant variations throughout the day. These 1 st results highlight the role of these smaller time scales. In the future, the hourly resolution of the dataset will allow deeper analysis of the periodicities related to the seasonal, daily, and tidal cycles that might explain part of the morphological variability observed here.",False,False,False,

Phytoplankton display a wide range of sizes which is known to be a key parameter in phytoplankton ecology. Thus, we expected that a combination of size measures would be the main driver of morphological variation. We observed communities of longer and more regular cells in winter and early spring, in agreement with the diatom domination in Narragansett Bay described by Pratt (1959) and Durbin et al. (1975). Indeed, diatoms are known to form very long chains and thus, would generally be the organisms with the longest elongation in our dataset. The number of blobs detected was the highest in winter but the lowest in spring, highlighting different diatoms dominate these seasons with winter diatoms without spines, more regularly shaped and more equally spaced than spring ones since the software was able to differentiate several cells on the image. The succession of peaks in length observed in winter and spring indicates that there are discontinuities in-between the different blooms: there is not just one diatom species dominating and being gradually replaced by a morphologically similar species, the diatom domination decreases before a bloom morphologically different from the previous one takes over. Adding taxonomic information from automatic classification confirms the succession of Skeletonema sp., Leptocylindrus sp., Thalassiosira sp., and Chaetoceros sp.-dominated communities. Since these communities are not gradually replacing each other, the dominance of diatoms decreases between blooms and the morphological signal comes back to a community dominated by smaller organisms with a regular shape; the taxonomic data corroborates the dominance of nanophytoplankton during those periods. As such, the morphological analysis allows us to distinguish which morphological traits are significantly changing throughout the blooming season: the general morphology decreases in length throughout the blooms while increasing in width and shape complexity. Skeletonema sp. have been extensively studied in Narragansett Bay and are considered the most abundant phytoplankton species of the Bay (Borkman and Smayda 2009;Windecker 2010;Canesi and Rynearson 2016). Although its highest cell counts have historically been recorded in late winter-early spring and midsummer (Karentz and Smayda 1984), our analysis shows that, for our time period, the morphological signal of Skeletonema sp. most likely drives only the first winter-spring blooms and is not significantly influencing the summer communities. Morphological analysis provides an easy and fast way to investigate general and functional community changes without prior taxonomic identification and reduces the complexity of the data. Although species identity provides equally important information (Salmaso et al. 2015), the combination of both taxonomic and morphological information shall provide a more complete understanding of community, functional, and intra-specific changes.",False,False,False,

The use of continuous imaging devices offers new opportunities to monitor phytoplankton communities, especially to study the triggers and developments of harmful algae blooms (Campbell et al. 2013;Anderson et al. 2019). Indeed, those high-throughput devices allow investigations on a much finer time scale than discrete sampling. They also give the possibility to go back to the high-quality images at the origin of the signal to perform further analysis retrospectively. Despite the cost of maintenance and computing (i.e., machine learning analysis of the images), their efficiency is high in comparison to the time-consuming task of identifying and measuring phytoplankton cells individually under a microscope. Similar to any net sampling, most of the imaging instruments cannot cover the whole size spectrum of the phytoplankton (Lombard et al. 2019), hence, in our analysis, picophytoplankton are not included, as the IFCB has a lower limit of 10 μm. This limits the analysis of the full phytoplankton size range and the possibility to sample, with the same instrument, higher trophic levels such as zooplankton. However, on their own or coupled with other imagery devices with different range capabilities, they open new possibilities for learning and exploring changes in taxonomical, morphological, and functional community composition at high-frequency periodicities (light or tidal cycle) and on the morphological responses of phytoplankton to flow at smaller time scales as wished by Naselli-Flores et al. (2020). This work thus presents one of the many approaches to exploit such rich datasets beyond taxonomical labeling. Although our time coverage is limited (2 yr), the methodology we present here could be applied to longer time series; this one, in the future, to confirm those local trends or others, linked to instruments deployed in places that might have different environmental forcings and different targeted organisms.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Western Lake Erie experiences an annual, toxic cyanobacterial harmful algal bloom (cyanoHAB), primarily caused by excess anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P). Because the non-N fixing cyanobacteria species Microcystis dominates these blooms, N availability is hypothesized to play a central role in cyanoHAB progression, as well as production of the N-rich toxin microcystin. Many previous studies focused on nitrate because it is the most abundant N substrate during bloom initiation. However, recent work implicated reduced N substrates like ammonium and dissolved organic N (DON) in promoting greater bloom biomass and longevity. To examine the relative importance of oxidized and reduced N substrates to phytoplankton during different bloom stages, we measured concentrations and natural abundance δ 15 N isotope values of dissolved N substrates and phytoplankton biomass throughout the entirety of the 2020 cyanoHAB in Western Lake Erie. The results provide the first data on DON dynamics and composition in Western Lake Erie, and suggest that phytoplankton, including Microcystis, likely relied on N regenerated from the DON pool in later bloom stages. In addition, the stable isotope data confirm the importance of nitrate delivered via the Maumee River to cyanobacterial growth and toxin production.The increasing occurrence of toxin-producing cyanobacterial harmful algal blooms (cyanoHABs) in freshwaters (Hou et al. 2022) is a major concern for drinking water quality and security. Blooms now occur annually in most of the Laurentian Great Lakes, which supply 84% of surface freshwater in North America. In Lake Erie, the shallowest and most productive of the Great Lakes, an annual summer cyanoHAB has occurred in the western basin for the last three decades. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) delivered to the lake via the Detroit, Maumee, and Sandusky rivers (Allinger and Reavie 2013) are mostly derived from nonpoint agricultural runoff (Maccoux et al. 2016;Scavia et al. 2016), and promote blooms of toxigenic cyanobacteria like Microcystis aeruginosa, which produce the hepatotoxic cyclic peptides known as microcystins.In Lake Erie and other lakes affected by cyanoHABs, annual P loading is well-established as a key predictor of overall bloom size (Kane et al. 2014;Stumpf et al. 2016), and therefore most management strategies focus on P (GLWQA 2016). However, N availability is an important driving factor for cya-noHABs dominated by nondiazotrophic cyanobacteria such as Microcystis, which rely on fixed N substrates present in chemically oxidized (nitrate, NO À 3 and nitrite, NO À 2 ), and reduced forms (ammonium, NH þ 4 , and dissolved organic nitrogen DON, including urea). Most phytoplankton use NH þ 4 before other N substrates, because NH þ 4 requires less energy to assimilate into cellular biomass (Flores and Herrero 2005). However, in most freshwater systems NO À 3 is more abundant than NH þ 4 (Durand et al. 2011), and Microcystis can use multiple forms of N, even in the presence of NH þ 4 (Chaffin and Bridgeman 2014; Belisle et al. 2016). Although total N loads have not increased since the 1990s (Kane et al. 2014; Stow et al. 2015), and there is no correlation between NO À 3 concentrations and bloom biomass (Kane et al. 2014), the proportion of non-nitrate or reduced N has increased in recent decades and is significantly, positively correlated with bloom biomass (Newell et al. 2019). Nondiazotrophic cyanobacteria have a strong affinity for reduced N substrates, allowing them to outcompete eukaryotic",False,False,False,

912,10.1002/lno.12311,2,True,"N availability and speciation is also important because cellular N status (i.e., N-replete vs. N-limited) influences microcystin toxin production. In culture studies with Microcystis, greater N availability resulted in increased expression of microcystin biosynthetic genes (Harke and Gobler 2015) or increased cellular microcystin quotas (Downing et al. 2005;Horst et al. 2014). Compared with P additions, N additions to natural communities resulted in a greater increase in microcystin concentrations (Davis et al. 2015;Jankowiak et al. 2019), and the greatest concentrations occurred under conditions of excess N relative to P (Beversdorf et al. 2015). Furthermore, because not all strains of Microcystis produce microcystins, toxin concentrations can depend on which strains are present. In Lake Erie and other cyanoHAB-affected lakes, toxin concentrations are often higher in early or peak stages of the bloom and decrease during later bloom stages, despite persistence of dense cyanobacterial biomass (Gobler et al. 2016;Berry et al. 2017). This is attributed to a community shift from dominantly toxigenic to nontoxigenic strains (Davis et al. 2009;Yancey et al. 2022), but the environmental drivers of this transition are unresolved. In Lake Erie, the relative abundance of toxic genotypes is positively correlated with NO À 3 concentrations (Yancey et al. 2022), and the greatest toxin concentrations seem to occur just after the seasonal peak in NO À 3 concentrations (Gobler et al. 2016;Berry et al. 2017). Therefore, N availability may directly influence the population dynamics of toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains. NO À 3 is drawn down to low concentrations by late summer (Chaffin et al. 2013), and toxin concentration tends to decline after that point. However, cyanobacterial biomass often remains high well into the fall. Microcystis must therefore be relying on other N sources after NO À 3 is consumed, such as labile components of DON or regenerated NH þ 4 (Hampel et al. 2019).",False,False,False,
913,10.1002/lno.12311,3,True,"The form of bioavailable N can also affect bloom toxin concentrations by influencing production of different microcystin structures (congeners), which vary in toxicity (Chernoff et al. 2020). In contrast to the results above that link NO À 3 with increased toxin concentrations, other studies observed that adding reduced N compounds like NH þ 4 or urea to natural communities increased microcystin production (Donald et al. 2011;Davis et al. 2015). In a study that examined three eutrophic lakes prone to blooms, total N, NH þ 4 , and DON concentrations all influenced the cyanobacterial community and congener composition, and DON in particular was positively correlated with Microcystis biomass (Monchamp et al. 2014). In many freshwater systems DON is a large proportion of the total dissolved N pool (Berman and Bronk 2003;Yao et al. 2020), but very little is known about DON in Lake Erie, including how its concentration compares to other frequently measured N sources like NO À 3 and NH þ 4 , and whether this evolves during the bloom.Evidence thus far points to a central role of N in cyanoHAB dynamics. An open question is whether the type of N substrate available influences bloom progression. In particular, the importance of DON to cyanobacterial growth and toxin production is unknown. The stable isotope ""fingerprints"" of N substrates and particulate organic matter (POM) can provide insight into this question, by tracing the sources and incorporation of N by phytoplankton during the bloom. This is possible because each pool of N (e.g., NO À 3 , NH þ 4 , POM) often has a distinct range of δ 15 N values (Lehmann et al. 2004;Kendall et al. 2007), which are determined by the δ 15 N composition of the N source and any subsequent isotopically fractionating reactions. These include biological transformations that convert one N form into another, such as nitrification, uptake or assimilation, and remineralization, which impart characteristic changes in δ 15 N values (Sigman et al. 2009). Examining the magnitude and direction of changes in δ 15 N values between pools of N, such as between N substrates and POM, can inform on N cycling processes occurring between stations or over time.",False,False,False,

## Sample collection
Samples were collected approximately weekly between mid-June and late September 2020, from three stations in the western basin of Lake Erie (Fig. 1). The stations form a transect extending offshore and correspond to NOAA-Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory (NOAA-GLERL) long-term monitoring Stas. WE9 (Maumee Bay), WE2 (Nearshore), and WE4 (Offshore). The water column depths differ between stations: 2.7, 5.7, and 8.9 m, for WE9, WE2, and WE4, respectively. Because of pandemic-related restrictions, WE4 could not be sampled until July. Water samples were collected from 0 to 1 m below the surface using a peristaltic pump and tubing, then transported in carboys back to the lab. In the lab, POM was collected by vacuum filtering 2 liters of water through precombusted glass fiber filters (GFFs, Cytiva-Whatman, 0.7 μm nominal pore size). Filters were frozen at À80 C, and the filtrate was subsequently filtered through 0.2-μm polyethersulfone flat filters (Millipore Express PLUS) and collected for nutrient and fluorescence analysis. Nutrient samples were frozen at À20 C until analysis, while fluorescence samples were stored at 4 C. All water samples were filtered and stored on the same day they were collected.## Phytoplankton community composition
Phytoplankton community composition was estimated using a submersible Fluoroprobe (bbe Moldaenke GmbH, Germany) which monitors in situ chlorophyll fluorescence. The Fluoroprobe quantifies four broad groups of chlorophyll a-containing phytoplankton (Beutler et al. 2002;Escoffier et al. 2015): (1) green algae, (2) cyanobacteria, (3) diatoms, and (4) cryptophytes. Fluorescence profiles for each group were depth-integrated and normalized to total chlorophyll concentrations to give the fraction of chlorophyll contributed by each group. Uncertainty in classification of each phytoplankton group by Fluoroprobe is estimated as AE 5% (Escoffier et al. 2015).",False,True,False,

Isotope measurements were standardized to the N 2 reference scale using standard reference materials IAEA N3 and USGS 34. The denitrifier method cannot distinguish between NO À 3 and NO À 2 , but NO À 2 is typically present at very low concentration in oxygenated surface waters and is therefore disregarded.

TDN concentration was corrected for any N contamination in reagents, but this was always < 0.5 μM or below detection.

## Bloom dynamics
The timing (initiation and decline), extent, and toxin concentrations of the Lake Erie cyanoHAB vary from year to year. In 2020, the bloom was relatively mild compared to previous years, with a bloom severity index (SI) of 3.0 (NOAA-NCCOS 2020). The SI is based on the amount of biomass during the peak 30 d of the bloom, and a bloom with SI above 5.0 is considered harmful (the largest bloom, in 2015, had a SI of 10.5). The 2020 bloom began in early July, reached peak biomass levels in late August, and declined in September. Particulate microcystin concentrations were low compared to previous years, peaking in late July at 4 μg L À1 at WE9, 2 μg L À1 at WE2, and < 1 μg L À1 at WE4 (Supporting Information Fig. S1). For comparison, during 2014, considered one of the most toxic blooms, microcystin concentrations reached 30 μg L À1 at WE2 and 12 μg L À1 at WE4 in early August. Surface scum was not observed at WE2, WE4, or WE9 during the 2020 bloom.The phytoplankton community composition varied between stations (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Cyanobacteria comprised the majority of the community at WE9 for most of the summer, except at the beginning and end of the sampling period, when there were greater contributions from green algae and diatoms, respectively. At WE2 cyanobacteria were most dominant in late July but co-existed with both diatoms and green algae later in the season.

The nearshore Stas. WE9 and WE2 followed a similar temporal pattern in nitrate concentration ([NO À 3 ]), with high concentrations from the spring nutrient pulse drawn down by phytoplankton uptake during June and July (Fig. 2). WE9 experienced the most variability in N concentrations, perhaps due to proximity to the Maumee River. At WE9, [NO À 3 ] reached a minimum concentration of 0.2 μM in early August, but concentrations increased again thereafter. At WE2, [NO À 3 ] reached a minimum of 0.07 μM in early August and remained < 1 μM for the rest of the season. Due to the delay in sampling WE4, the data does not show whether the initial peak in [NO À 3 ] was present, but [NO À 3 ] remained high relative to the other two stations with a median value of 18 μM compared to 10.8 μM at WE9 and 0.3 μM at WE2, from 7/28 forward (Fig. 2). Ammonium concentrations ([NH þ 4 ]) were very low across all three stations, with higher concentrations in early June (Fig. 2). This agrees with previous data in Lake Erie, which suggests that
4 is rapidly taken up by cyanobacteria and/or nitrifying bacteria. Because of this high bioreactivity, concentrations are not necessarily representative of NH þ 4 availability and utilization. Recent work measured the highest potential NH þ 4 uptake rates near the Maumee River inflow and during the peak bloom months (Hoffman et al. 2022). DON concentration ([DON]) was calculated by subtracting [NO À 3 /NO À 2 ] and [NH þ 4 ] from total dissolved N concentration, ([TDN]
). In general, DON concentrations were higher at nearshore compared to offshore stations (Fig. 2; Supporting Information Table S1). At both WE9 and WE2, [DON] increases as [NO À 3 ] decreases, and becomes the most abundant N substrate in August and much of September, making up 50% or more of the total N pool (Fig. 2; Supporting Information Fig. S2). This pattern is most striking at WE2 where [DON] is up to 80X greater than other N substrates and close to 100% of total dissolved N. At WE4 [DON] is comparable to [NO À 3 ] in magnitude, with a median concentration of 14.8 μM.

There were spatial and temporal patterns in the isotope values of POM (δ 15 N POM ), NO À 3 (δ 15 N NO3 ), and TRN (δ 15 N TRN ). δ 15 N NO3 and δ 15 N TRN both had relatively higher values closer to shore and lower values offshore. δ 15 N POM values were higher at WE9, but similar between Stas. WE2 and WE4 (Table 1). Temporal patterns in δ 15 N POM were similar between WE9 and WE2, where δ 15 N POM increased throughout June and July, reached a high point in late July, and decreased in August. At WE9 δ 15 N POM increased again during September, from 5‰ in mid-August to 11‰ in mid-September (Fig. 4). In contrast, at WE2 δ 15 N POM remained between 4‰ and 5‰ from mid-August onward.δ 15 N TRN varied throughout the bloom, suggesting that the inputs and outputs to the DON pool indicated by changing [DON] concentrations affected isotope values (Fig. 4). [DON] and δ 15 N TRN were moderately, positively correlated (r s = 0.63, p = 0.0001). In contrast, despite rapid drawdown of NO À 3 early in the sampling period, δ 15 N NO3 showed little temporal variation, and was not correlated with [NO À 3 ], suggesting that fractionation associated with biological uptake was not the dominant control on δ 15 N NO3 values. This agrees with other studies that suggest external N sources are the major control on nitrate isotope composition in lakes (Ostrom et al. 1997;Teranes and Bernasconi 2000).

## Phytoplankton usage of N substrates
In aquatic environments like Lake Erie where phytoplankton are the major component of POM during the summer months, δ 15 N POM is controlled by the isotope composition of the N substrate(s) and isotope fractionation during phytoplankton uptake. δ 15 N POM therefore records an integrated signal of the N sources used by phytoplankton. We compared   δ 15 N POM with δ 15 N NO3 and δ 15 N TRN to examine whether phytoplankton used one or both of these N substrates throughout the bloom.",False,False,False,
925,10.1002/lno.12311,15,True,"The isotope data suggest that NO À 3 was a more important source of N for phytoplankton than DON in two different ways. First, δ 15 N POM exhibited a stronger relationship with δ 15 N NO3 (r s = 0.52, p = 0.003) than with δ 15 N TRN (r s = 0.33, p = 0.06; Fig. 6). Second, phytoplankton preferentially take up 14 N-containing material, leaving the remaining pool of N substrate enriched in 15 N (Fogel and Cifuentes 1993;Granger et al. 2010). Therefore, when N is not limiting, δ 15 N POM should always be lower than the δ 15 N of the primary N substrate (Ostrom et al. 1997;McCusker et al. 1999;Finlay and Kendall 2007). For about 60% of the samples, δ 15 N POM was lower than or similar to the corresponding δ 15 N NO3 , but δ 15 N TRN was almost always less than or equal to δ 15 N POM (Fig. 6), supporting NO À 3 as a more important N substrate than DON for much of the bloom. Among the remaining 40% of samples that had δ 15 N POM greater than both δ 15 N NO3 and δ 15 N TRN , most are from Stas. WE9 and WE4. At WE9, this occurred mostly in June and July, and may reflect phytoplankton usage of isotopically heavy NH þ 4 from the Maumee River. We did not measure δ 15 N of NH þ 4 during this study, but previously measured NH 4 + δ 15 N values had a median value of 12‰ (Supporting Information Table S3), which would be consistent with the high δ 15 N POM values observed here.

926,10.1002/lno.12311,16,True,"WE4 δ 15 N POM was higher relative to both NO À 3 and DON later in the summer (after 8/24, Fig. 4), and delivery of isotopically heavy ammonium seems less likely than at Sta. WE9. One possible explanation for the pattern at WE4 is advection or transport of material from elsewhere. Advection of material from WE2 is unlikely, as POM values remained low through the second part of the summer, but another possible source is material transported from the Detroit River, as WE4 is influenced by both Maumee and Detroit River water.Despite the clear importance of nitrate during the bloom, DON became a more important N substrate for phytoplankton in later bloom stages. For example, nearly all NO À 3 was consumed at Sta. WE2 after 8/10, and δ 15 N POM and δ 15 N TRN converged toward similar values (Fig. 4). This suggests phytoplankton reliance on recycled N derived from the DON pool, which would push δ 15 N POM to lower values. A similar convergence of δ 15 N POM and δ 15 N TRN occurred at Sta. WE9 from 8/10 to 9/7, when [NO À 3 ] was also nearly zero, again suggesting phytoplankton usage of DON. This reliance on regenerated N is supported by previous work in Lake Erie (Hoffman et al. 2022) and in other eutrophic lake systems such as Lake Taihu (Hampel et al. 2018) and Lake Champlain (McCarthy et al. 2013).",False,False,False,

Riverine discharge is the major influence underpinning the patterns observed in δ 15 N values of nitrate, and to a lesser extent, in DON and POM (Fig. 5). δ 15 N values of nitrate form a spatial gradient between near and offshore stations that is strongly, positively correlated with conductivity (Fig. 5A). This suggests two isotopically distinct NO À 3 sources: an isotopically heavier source originating from the Maumee River, and a lighter source associated with the Detroit River. The higher δ 15 N values from the Maumee likely result from agricultural land use, including increased application of manure and organic Nbased fertilizers (Millar et al. 2014). Measurements of Detroit River water δ 15 N NO3 averaged 2.4‰ in a recent study (Colborne et al. 2019), but the reasons for these low values are not fully known. Low δ 15 N NO3 values were previously observed in Lake Superior, with mean values of À4.1‰ (Ostrom et al. 1998) and À2.3‰ (Finlay et al. 2007), interpreted as resulting from in-lake nitrification of ammonium/ reduced N in rain and runoff (Finlay et al. 2007). The Detroit River connects the upstream lakes of Superior, Michigan, and Huron to downstream Lake Erie (via Lake St. Clair), so Detroit River δ 15 N NO3 values could be partially due to propagation of δ 15 N NO3 signature from Lake Superior.",False,False,False,
928,10.1002/lno.12311,18,True,"Although δ 18 O NO3 is often used to differentiate between sources that overlap in δ 15 N NO3 , both biological uptake and N cycling processes like nitrification, which is dominant in oxygenated environments, can blur initial isotopic compositions of both δ 15 N and δ 18 O. The range of δ 18 O NO3 values in our data are consistent with NO À 3 originating from nitrification, either in soils or rivers/lakes, but the lack of separation in δ 18 O NO3 values between samples or stations makes it difficult to quantify relative contributions of potential NO À 3 sources. The data show little evidence for direct contributions from either atmospheric NO À 3 or nitrate-based fertilizers to Western Lake Erie (Supporting Information Fig. S5). This could reflect decreasing usage of nitrate-based fertilizers in agriculture (Cao et al. 2018). However, depending on the timing and nature of fertilizer application, NO À 3 from fertilizers may also be mixed into the soil N pool before being transported to rivers and lakes, with plant or soil microbial N cycling processes obscuring the original isotope signature before reaching the lake (Deutsch et al. 2006). Isotope measurements of potential NO À 3 source endmembers (e.g., soils, storm drains, river water) in the Maumee and Detroit River watersheds may allow better deconvolution of Western Lake Erie NO À 3 sources. NO À 3 concentrations were not correlated with microcystin concentrations, but there was a positive correlation between microcystin concentrations and δ 15 N POM (Fig. 7B), suggesting that the N sources linked to microcystin production had higher δ 15 N values. Most toxin production occurred at the nearshore Stas. WE9 and WE2 (Supporting Information Fig. S1), where phytoplankton were likely relying on isotopically heavier N substrates originating from the Maumee River. This is supported by a positive correlation between δ 15 N NO3 and microcystin concentrations (Fig. 7A). Isotopically heavy ammonium could also be a N substrate for toxigenic Microcystis, as was observed in other systems (Lehman et al. 2015).

The temporal variability in DON concentrations and N isotope composition suggests a dynamic DON pool, and that some components are bioavailable on a seasonal timescale. This contrasts with trends observed in less eutrophic systems, where δ 15 N TRN and [DON] remained nearly constant; these include a subarctic lake (Gu 2012) and in the subtropical oceans (Knapp et al. 2005). Concentrations of DON in Western Lake Erie (8.5-57.5 μM) were within the lower end of the large range previously reported for freshwater lakes (4.0-200 μM Feuerstein et al. 1997;Berman and Bronk 2003;Zhang et al. 2015); concentrations as high as 327 μM were reported in hypereutrophic Lake Taihu (Yao et al. 2020). There are limited δ 15 N measurements of DON in lakes, but the Western Lake Erie δ 15 N TRN values are similar to data from Lake Michigan, USA (2.6-5.8‰;Feuerstein et al. 1997) and Lake Suwa, Japan (7.3‰; Yoshioka et al. 1988), both of which are influenced by human activity and land use. DON δ 15 N values lower than those in Western Lake Erie were observed in Lake Superior (À1.2‰, Feuerstein et al. 1997) and in Lake Kizaki, Japan (3.0‰; Yoshioka et al. 1988), which are less anthropogenically influenced.",False,False,False,
930,10.1002/lno.12311,20,True,"Work in the marine environment has shown that processes such as cell lysis or particle solubilization that produce fresh DON from POM are nonfractionating and result in DON with a similar δ 15 N value to the POM from which it is derived (Fawcett et al. 2011;Knapp et al. 2011). In contrast, there is likely isotope fractionation associated with processes that break down existing DON molecules to produce biologically available forms of N, for example, via deamination or hydrolysis of peptide bonds (Macko et al. 1986;Bada et al. 1989). Such reaction pathways are highly expressed in the Microcystis-associated microbiome (Smith et al. 2022), and would result in the release of isotopically lighter DON components like small peptides or ammonium that could be more accessible to phytoplankton, especially Microcystis. High NH þ 4 regeneration rates recently measured in Lake Erie (Hoffman et al. 2022) support active breakdown of DON via these types of reactions, and incorporation of this isotopically lighter material by phytoplankton would produce the relatively lower δ 15 N POM values we observed.",False,False,False,
931,10.1002/lno.12311,21,True,"Considering the above, the pattern of δ 15 N TRN ≤ δ 15 N POM suggests that much of DON derives from POM. DON cycling in Western Lake Erie is probably complex, with many reactions that could influence δ 15 N TRN , and it is difficult to identify specific processes from bulk isotope values. However, the positive direction of the relationship between [TRN] and δ 15 N TRN (Supporting Information Fig. S6) argues against a fractionating removal process, such as phytoplankton uptake, as the major control on δ 15 N TRN . Such a process would instead produce a negative correlation by removing 14 N and leaving residual DON enriched in 15 N. Therefore, instead of a spring pulse of DON followed by processing and removal throughout the summer, the isotope data suggest continual in situ production of DON from POM at each station, with δ 15 N TRN values reflecting the trend of higher to lower δ 15 N POM and δ 15 N NO3 values from nearshore to offshore stations (Fig. 5). This is supported by the nearshore to offshore increase in the Peak T/A ratio, which indicates there is more of the amino acid-like fraction of DOM relative to soil-derived OM (Supporting Information Fig. S4). Previous work in Lake Erie identified a similar pattern, which is explained by more sinks and fewer sources for Peak A material than for Peak T material in the lake (Cory et al. 2016, and references therein). However, given the strong positive relationship between specific conductivity and Peak T (Supporting Information Fig. S3), a fraction of the DON pool must be terrestrial or riverine in origin and could also be isotopically lighter than POM. The size of this terrestrial fraction is difficult to estimate from the data here, because the FDOM proxies are not quantitative. [DON] is moderately correlated with both specific conductivity (r s = 0.61 p = 2 Â 10 À5 ), and with Peak T (r s = 0.62, p = 1.75 Â 10 À5 ). One possible explanation of these observations is that Peak T represents a mostly terrestrial fraction of DON that is more conservative than the bulk DON pool, leading to a strong relationship between Peak T DON and conductivity. However, in situ production of DON from POM could produce both additional Peak T DON and nonfluorescent DON, resulting in weaker correlations between
[DON] and both Peak T and specific conductivity. Future measurements of riverine FDOM, and riverine DON isotopic and molecular composition, could help constrain how much of the DON pool originates from terrestrial vs. in-lake sources.",False,False,False,

This study tracked sources and forms of N during progression of the cyanoHAB in Lake Erie. The results suggest that NO À 3 was a greater contributor to phytoplankton biomass than DON, and that riverine input was the primary influence on NO À 3 δ 15 N values in Western Lake Erie, with little effect from biological processes. Toxin concentrations were positively correlated with δ 15 N values of POM and NO À 3 , suggesting that toxin-producing cyanobacteria relied on isotopically heavier N substrates sourced from the Maumee River. The DON pool in Lake Erie was spatially and temporally dynamic, and the fraction of DON in the total dissolved N pool increased from early to late summer. Much of the DON was likely autochthonous material derived from POM, and became a more important N substrate for phytoplankton in late summer after depletion of NO À 3 . These results support previous work on the importance of regenerated N in the longevity of cyanoHABs (Hampel et al. 2018(Hampel et al. , 2019;;Hoffman et al. 2022). Although the interpretive power of bulk measurements is limited, the patterns identified here provide a starting point for future work examining how both external and internal N sources fuel blooms in Western Lake Erie. For example, combining metatranscriptomics with chemical and isotopic measurements of N substrates and POM would enable us to address how the shift from NO À 3 to DON may be connected to previously observed community shifts in cyanobacterial strain diversity (Yancey et al. 2022). In addition, DON is a complex mixture of molecules spanning a wide range of labilities, and mechanisms Microcystis use to access DON during the bloom remain mostly unknown, including the potential role of Microcystis-associated heterotrophic bacteria in releasing bioavailable N compounds from DON (Purvina et al. 2010;Hoke et al. 2021;Smith et al. 2022). Finally, concentration, isotope, and even 'omics measurements are ""snapshots"" that may not capture quickly cycling material such as labile components of DON and regenerated ammonium. Future studies should balance these techniques with measurements of N uptake and regeneration rates, which are likely especially critical for understanding late-stage bloom dynamics.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
In upwelling systems, fluctuations in seawater pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature can expose species to extremes that differ greatly from the mean conditions. Understanding the nature of this exposure to extremes, including how exposure to low pH, low DO concentrations, and temperature varies spatiotemporally and in the context of other drivers, is critical for informing global change biology. Here, we use a 4-yr time series of coupled pH, DO, and temperature observations at six nearshore kelp forest sites spanning the coast of California to characterize the variability and covariance among these drivers. We further compare observed properties to those derived from a high-resolution coupled physical-biogeochemical simulation for the central California current system. We find the intensity, duration, and severity of exposure to extreme conditions beyond heuristic, biologically relevant pH T (< 7.7), and DO (< 4.6 mg L À1 ) values were greatest at sites with strong upwelling. In contrast, sites with relatively weaker upwelling had little exposure to pH or DO conditions below these heuristic values but had higher and more variable temperature. The covariance between pH, DO, and temperature was highest in sites with strong upwelling and weakest in sites with limited upwelling. These relationships among pH, DO, and temperature at the observation locations were mirrored in the model, and model output highlighted geographic differences in exposure regimes across the California marine protected area network. Together, these results provide important insight into the conditions marine ecosystems are exposed to relevant to studies of global change biology.",False,False,False,

Extreme conditions play a critical role in shaping species' physiology, ecology, and distribution (Helmuth et al. 2010;Bates et al. 2018;Denny and Dowd 2022). This may be especially important for species' responses to global change, as gradual changes in environmental conditions may overlay on natural variability to create extremes far beyond the mean conditions projected by climate models (Kroeker et al. 2020). Advances in ocean observing have highlighted the considerable temporal dynamism inherent in key global change drivers in the ocean, including seawater carbonate chemistry (Hofmann et al. 2011;Takeshita et al. 2015;Chan et al. 2017), dissolved oxygen (DO) (Low et al. 2021), and temperature (Helmuth et al. 2016), upending long held paradigms about the relative stability of the ocean environment compared to land. However, our understanding of the extreme conditions organisms regularly experience in dynamic oceanographic settings, especially across multiple, concurrent abiotic conditions related to global change is limited. Moreover, deciphering how temporal variability in abiotic conditions translates to ecologically relevant extremes in exposure is critical for informing the future of ocean global change biology (Bates et al. 2018;Gruber et al. 2021).Organismal exposure to extreme conditions can be characterized in different ways. Extremes can be established using long-term climatologies to distinguish statistically rare environmental conditions (e.g., extreme events such as marine heat waves; Hobday et al. 2016;Gruber et al. 2021). Exposure to these extreme events can have profound, deleterious consequences for marine organisms (Smale et al. 2019). In contrast, deleterious but sublethal conditions can be experienced regularly in temporally variable environments when conditions extend beyond an organism's physiological optimum (Somero 1995(Somero , 2002)). Exposure to these types of semi-regular, extreme conditions can be determined relative to values of biological significance (e.g., physiological thresholds). Characterizing both the magnitude of the excursions beyond these biologically significant values, as well as the duration of exposure to these sublethal conditions, is important for understanding organisms' exposure to extreme conditions in dynamic environments, now and in the future.",False,False,False,
938,10.1002/lno.12371,2,True,"Eastern boundary upwelling systems are temporally dynamic environments that sit on the frontlines of global ocean change. For example, the California current system is experiencing accelerated rates of ocean acidification associated with upwelling and accumulation of anthropogenic CO 2 (Feely et al. 2008). Upwelled source waters are already high in dissolved inorganic carbon due to remineralization at depth, and these source waters are projected to become more acidified with continued CO 2 emissions (Gruber et al. 2012;Hauri et al. 2013). Indeed, surface waters across much of the California current system are forecasted to be undersaturated in aragonite for 50% or more of the time by midcentury (Gruber et al. 2012). Critical marine species are already experiencing dissolution during episodic upwelling events (Bednaršek et al. 2014(Bednaršek et al. , 2020;;Mekkes et al. 2021;Donham et al. 2022), highlighting the potential for episodic exposure to low pH or saturation states to disrupt marine food webs and ecosystems. Moreover, these upwelled waters are also low in DO due to respiration at depth, and these waters can become hypoxic (defined here as DO concentrations < 2 mg L À1 or 30 μmol L À1 ) (Grantham et al. 2004;Chan et al. 2008). Prolonged hypoxic conditions in the nearshore environment have been linked to large-scale die-offs (Hern andez-Miranda et al. 2012). However, more modest reductions in DO concentrations can negatively affect marine species, even when the concentrations are not considered hypoxic (Vaquer-Sunyer and Duarte 2008). Importantly, upwelling is generally expected to intensify (Bakun et al. 2015;Wang et al. 2015), and upwelled waters are projected to become lower in pH, saturation state, and DO in the future (Gruber et al. 2012;Hauri et al. 2013).",False,False,False,
939,10.1002/lno.12371,3,True,"Because upwelling is episodic in nature, organismal exposure to low pH and DO conditions varies considerably through time in upwelling systems. The temporal dynamics of exposure are clearly important, as fluctuations in seawater pH have been shown to mediate species responses to the mean conditions (Cornwall et al. 2013;Frieder et al. 2014). While climate and biogeochemical models can provide some insight into the intensity and duration of potentially stressful conditions in upwelling systems (Hauri et al. 2013), little is known about the intensity and duration of exposure to coupled low pH and DO conditions currently observed in nearshore environments of upwelling systems.The temporal dynamics of exposure to extremes in pH and DO are likely to vary spatially based on the frequency and intensity of upwelling. Chan et al. (2017) demonstrated that the exposure to extreme pH conditions varies across space in the California current system (i.e., lowest fifth percentile of pH values from continuous time series from rocky intertidal ecosystems), and this variability is persistent through time. Similarly, biogeochemical models suggest persistent variability in mean seawater pH across the California current system are linked to geospatial patterns in upwelling intensity and productivity (Cheresh and Fiechter 2020). However, the timing and length of the upwelling season vary interannually and with latitude, leading to differences in what time of year organisms are exposed to more extreme conditions geographically. Understanding spatial patterns in magnitudes, as well as the timing of exposure to extremes, may provide important insight for management (e.g., informing geospatial variability in population dynamics of ecologically or commercially important species or marine protected area efficacy).",False,False,False,
940,10.1002/lno.12371,4,True,"Characterizing how covariance between pH, DO, and temperature varies across space may be useful in understanding organisms' exposure to extreme conditions (Walter et al. 2022). It is unclear whether temporal patterns in seawater pH are mirrored in DO concentrations across space. While pH and DO are linked in upwelled source water due to respiration at depth (Chan et al. 2017;Donham et al. 2022), the relationship between pH and DO in surface waters could be decoupled in nearshore environments. For example, DO concentrations at the surface may primarily be driven by source waters in areas of intense, persistent upwelling (and therefore linked to pH). In contrast, DO concentrations may be primarily driven by sea surface temperature in areas of weaker upwelling where the DO in upwelled waters has time to equilibrate with the atmosphere at the surface (Levin 2018;Walter et al. 2022). The difference in gas exchange rates between oxygen vs. CO 2 can lead to a quicker equilibration of oxygen with the atmosphere and a decoupling of pH and DO. Additionally, upwelled waters are colder than surface waters, and temperature is expected to covary with pH and DO in areas of intense upwelling. Similarly, temperature can become decoupled from pH and DO in areas of weak upwelling when temperature is more influenced by atmospheric conditions rather than upwelled waters. Characterizing the geospatial patterns of covariance between pH, DO, and temperature is a critical next step for understanding how species' exposure will change as ocean warming, acidification, and deoxygenation influence these variables. Moreover, understanding how vulnerable species, ecosystems, and management units are distributed across the range of these conditions will help managers understand where species are exposed to tightly coupled stressors (e.g., upwelling conditions) vs. where species may likely encounter exposure to an individual stressor that is decoupled from the other drivers.",False,False,False,

To test these hypotheses, we characterize how the covariance between these three drivers varies across space. In addition, we calculate the intensity, duration, and severity of exposure (sensu Hauri et al. 2013) to extreme conditions beyond heuristic, biologically relevant pH and DO values (Gruber et al. 2021).

## Environmental monitoring
In November of 2017, a network of pH, DO, and temperature sensors were established within kelp forests along the California coast (Fig. 1; Table S1). Custom pH sensors utilizing the Honeywell DuraFET combination pH electrode (similar to a SeaFET; Bresnahan et al. 2014) were deployed alongside optical DO sensors (MiniDOT, PME) at six sites at $ 12 m depth, spanning the state's coastline. In each region of northern, central, and southern California, a separate sensor package was deployed at two sites. We targeted one site with relatively ""stronger"" upwelling and another with relatively ""weaker"" upwelling within each region based on vertical velocities from a high-resolution coupled physical-biogeochemical model for the central California current (Fiechter and Edwards 2018). All sensors were deployed in marine protected areas monitored by the Reef Check California (RCCA) kelp forest monitoring program.All sensor packages measured pH, DO, and temperature every 10 min. The sensor packages are swapped by RCCA technicians and volunteers every 2-3 months. Factory calibrations are used for temperature, oxygen sensors are calibrated in the lab prior to each deployment, and an in situ calibration method was developed and implemented for the pH sensors.Optode DO sensors can exhibit drift during storage, but are stable once deployed (D'Asaro and McNeil 2013). The errors can be as large as 10's of percent, thus it is critical to correct for this storage drift (Takeshita et al. 2013). In practice, the optodes can be accurately corrected for using a gain-only correction (Bittig et al. 2018):
where G represents a gain factor established during predeployment calibration. G was established prior to each deployment by making measurements in 100% saturated water that was prepared by gently bubbling atmospheric air near the surface of the solution (to prevent oversaturation). DO sensors were typically calibrated within 1-2 months prior to deployment, and the median G was 1.006 AE 0.0196 (1 σ; n = 64). Thus, we estimate the DO is accurate to AE 2%.",False,True,False,

However, when a sensor failed during deployment such that a recovery calibration was not available, then the k0 obtained at time of deployment was used. At the beginning of the dive, we attached a custom flow cell encapsulating the sensing elements of the DuraFET. The flow cell consists of two luer lock fittings for the inlet and outlet, with an internal volume of $ 5 mL. One-way valves attached to each port prevent seawater from diffusing back into the flow cell after Tris has been injected using a plastic syringe. To ensure that the flow cell is flushed with Tris, we use a syringe (60 mL) that is > 10 times the volume of the flow cell. At the end of the dive, the diver reattaches the anti-fouling copper cap (for deployment calibrations) or brings up the sensor with the flow cell attached (for recovery calibrations). The pH sensors make measurements at 10-min intervals, and a typical dive time is $ 45 min. Therefore, each calibration produces 3-4 measurements, and the most stable measurement(s) (i.e., leveling off of pH and temperature) was used to calculate k0.",False,False,False,

We visually inspected each deployment to assess whether pH, DO, and temperature data showed similar patterns. Next, data were flagged if they fell outside ranges of possible values (pH < 7.3 or > 8.7; DO% saturation < 0 or > 150%; Temperature < 5 or > 35 о C). Finally, we ran a despiking filter in Matlab. Summary statistics were created for each site. To assess the relationships between pH, DO, and temperature at each site, we plotted the relationships using R and calculated correlation coefficients.",False,False,False,
945,10.1002/lno.12371,9,True,"Given pH and DO in the California current system are highly influenced by upwelling and therefore variable on daily and seasonal timescales, we also calculated several summary statistics that represented the exposure to potentially biologically stressful pH and DO conditions relevant to marine organisms. Summary statistics were calculated based on daily averaged observations. We calculated the mean severity, duration, and intensity of exposure events below predetermined values in pH and DO for each month of the year. Duration is defined as the number of days conditions remain below the predetermined (""threshold"") value for a given low pH or low DO event (unit = days). Using this calculation, it is possible for an event lasting longer than 28-31 d (i.e., a month, depending on the month in question) to be counted in multiple months. This only occurred once (e.g., a low pH event that started in April and continued into May at Big Creek). Intensity is defined as the threshold value minus the mean pH or DO value during a given event (units of pH or DO). Severity is defined as the product of duration and intensity (unit = days*[pH] or days*[DO]). Threshold values for pH and DO were chosen to represent ecologically relevant conditions that could be physiologically challenging for a wide range of organisms. A pH threshold of 7.7 was chosen to represent the aragonite saturation state of 1 across a wide range of total alkalinity (TA) values seen in the California Current System (2200-2300 μmol kg À1 ). Saturation state was computed using sensor pH and TA values ranging from 2200 to 2300 μmol kg À1 , which is a conservative estimate given that this range is substantially larger than that of observed TA values in the surface California current system. Based on this analysis, a pH T of 7.7 corresponded on average to a saturation state of 1 AE 0.15 (range). Exposure to conditions below the saturation state of 1 have been shown to favor dissolution over calcification of calcium carbonate, although values above this threshold may also be physiologically stressful. A DO threshold of 4.6 mg L À1 (147 μmol L À1 ) was chosen based on the results of a metaanalysis that indicated biological effects are first apparent at this level (Vaquer-Sunyer and Duarte 2008). It is important to note that these conditions are not universally stressful to all organisms, but the summary statistics provide insight into geographic and temporal variability in exposure to potentially stressful conditions relevant to a wide range of marine organisms in the California current system (Gray et al. 2002;Mattiasen et al. 2020;Walter et al. 2022). Thus, these analyses provide a heuristic process for characterizing exposure to extreme conditions in a spatially and temporally variable environment. Several sensitivity analyses were performed using different thresholds for pH T (< 7.6) and DO (< 3.5 mg L À1 ), including an event analysis of a heuristic metabolic index (sensu Deutsch et al. 2015;Howard et al. 2020) to account for the potential temperature sensitivity of hypoxia tolerance for comparison with the DO extreme event analysis (Data S1).",False,False,False,

We compared the observational data to model output from a high-resolution (3 km) coupled physical-biogeochemical model, hereafter referred to as ROMS-NEMUCSC (Fiechter and Edwards 2018;Cheresh and Fiechter 2020), to assess whether the covariance patterns in the pH and DO observational data aligned with model output from a different, but longer time period. Specifically, daily model output from the ROMS-NEMUCSC model was extracted at the closest grid cell to land at the latitudes corresponding to the six observational stations (Table S1) for the period of 1988-2010. Given the model horizontal resolution, the simulated time series likely reflect similar coastal regimes. Depth differences between observations and model output ranged between 25 and 50 m, except for Catalina Island (Table S1). Thus, we used quantities from the model averaged between 0 and 30 m depth to compare with the observations, assuming water masses found in this depth range would represent those influencing nearshore sensors ($ 12 m depth). We then used daily averages from the historical simulation to calculate Pearson correlation coefficients between temperature Â pH T , temperature Â DO, and pH T Â DO for all coastal California marine protected areas. If a given marine protected area had an area smaller than the grid resolution, we extracted the model output at the grid point closest to the center of the protected area. Otherwise, we averaged grid cells falling within a circle from the marine protected area center whose area was equivalent. We then categorized each marine protected area as ""strongly"" influenced by upwelling if its correlation fell in the upper quartile (R > 0.695) and ""weakly"" influenced by upwelling if its correlation fell in the lower quartile (R < 0.337).",False,True,False,

## Environmental monitoring
Mean pH, DO, and temperature were lowest in the northern California sites and highest in the southern California sites (Table 1). In contrast, daily variability in pH and DO (represented by standard deviation of the mean) was highest in the northern California sites and lowest in the southern sites. Excursions below pH T of 7.7 and DO of 4.6 mg L À1 were most frequent in northern California sites, less frequent in central California sites, and almost entirely absent from the southern California sites (Figs. 2, S1). In contrast to the patterns in pH and DO, daily and seasonal variability in temperature was highest in the southern California sites (Figs. 2, S1). The relationships between pH, DO, and temperature were tightly coupled in the northern California sites, and became progressively weaker moving south (Fig. 3; Table 2). The coherence between the two observational sensor array sites in each region was high [assessed visually (Fig. S2) and using the  ROMS-NEMUCSC model output (Fig. S3-S5)]. Thus, one site for each region is highlighted in the figures.The severity, duration, and intensity of pH T events below 7.7 varied through time and across sites (Fig. 4).

At the central California sites, the duration of events below pH T 7.7 are longest in spring (April-May) and fall (October-November) months. Event intensity follows a similar temporal pattern to duration in central California, resulting in a peak of severity in spring and fall. The magnitude of event severity was similar between northern and central California sites, due to higher intensity (e.g., lower pH conditions) in northern California vs. longer duration events in central California.

The correlations between temperature, pH, and DO in the simulation closely mirrored the observations (Fig. S7). In the simulation, the strength of these relationships exhibits substantial latitudinal variability, reflecting local-scale differences in upwelling dynamics and intensity (Fig. 6). The highest correlations in both the simulation and observations occur between pH and DO. The highest correlations among all three combinations of drivers occur in distinct regions of northern California [from Cape Mendocino ($ 40 N) to Pt Reyes ($ 38 N)] and in central California [from Monterey Bay ($ 36.5 N) to Point Conception ($ 34.5 N)] (Fig. 6). The correlations between each pair of drivers becomes progressively weaker moving south from Point Conception, with several areas of the Channel Island and Southern California Bight demonstrating little to no correlation among temperature and pH. Based on correlations calculated for California marine protected areas, sites in northern California are evenly distributed across strong and average upwelling influences, although almost all marine protected areas exposed to strong upwelling occur in the region directly south of Pt Arena ($ 38-39 N) (Fig. 6d). Comparatively, marine protected areas in central California undergo a stronger upwelling influence along the Big Sur coast ($ 35-36.5 N) and more moderate to weak upwelling conditions in the San Francisco Bay region (36.5-38 N). Finally, marine protected areas in southern California are evenly distributed across areas of average and weak upwelling, with a few marine protected areas in regions of strong upwelling just south of Point Conception.",False,False,False,

The data collected via the observing network demonstrate the extreme environmental conditions organisms in the California Current System already experience due to natural fluctuations in seawater pH, DO, and temperature. These patterns differed temporally and geographically, highlighting the different exposure regimes within which organisms currently reside. During the period of observations (2017-2021), the sites in northern California had higher exposure to potentially biologically stressful pH and DO conditions, but cooler temperatures overall. In contrast, the sites in southern California were never exposed to conditions used to assess physiological stress in the event scale analyses (i.e., pH T < 7.7 or DO < 4.6 mg L À1 ). The sites in southern California were warmer compared to the other regions, but the sites varied more among each other than in other regions. Moreover, when we calculated a heuristic metabolic index that accounts for the temperature sensitivity of hypoxia tolerance, we did detect extreme events at one site in southern California. These findings suggest that while southern California currently experiences few extreme events with respect to the pH and DO thresholds we chose, this region is likely to become more physiologically stressful for marine organisms as temperature rise and DO concentrations decrease with global change. The sites in central California were intermediate to northern California and southern California. These sites experienced less potentially physiologically stressful pH and DO conditions than the sites in northern California and cooler temperature than southern California. These findings demonstrate how populations along the California coast likely vary in the extremes experienced in biogeochemistry and temperature that are far beyond what is projected for global environmental change.",False,False,False,
951,10.1002/lno.12371,15,True,"The event analyses highlight the importance of long-term monitoring in understanding exposure patterns of marine organisms to ocean acidification and deoxygenation, now and in the future. Because exposure to low pH and low DO conditions in the northern and central California regions is strongly associated with upwelling (Feely et al. 2008), exposure is and will continue to be highly variable through time with seasonal minima in pH and DO conditions. Thus, summaries of mean conditions or snapshots of conditions over discrete time periods may not adequately capture ecologically relevant aspects of ocean acidification and deoxygenation exposure. For example, the mean pH at Big Creek in Central California of 7.84 does not capture that marine species at this site regularly experienced conditions below pH 7.7 for over a week at a time during spring upwelling. Numerous studies have documented reductions in net calcification and growth of ecologically and economically important species in the California current system (e.g., pteropods, abalone, and urchins) with prolonged exposure to pH values that organisms in northern and central California regions are regularly experiencing during upwelling events (Swezey et al. 2020;Mekkes et al. 2021;Donham et al. 2022). Although our understanding of how intermittent exposure to low pH conditions affects marine species is limited, our event analyses highlight the durations of events below pH T 7.7 in the northern California sites during late summer range from 12 and 20 d on average. A better understanding of these patterns of exposure can provide critical insight into organismal performance and vulnerability, especially as ocean acidification and deoxygenation accelerate and upwelling dynamics change with continued CO 2 emissions. For example, if exposure to low pH and DO conditions causes reductions in species growth rates (Donham et al. 2022), then we might expect slower recovery in areas with more severe low pH/DO events following a disturbance.",False,False,False,
952,10.1002/lno.12371,16,True,"Models are useful to contextualize point observations (e.g., coherence maps) and justify extrapolation to unobserved locations. As such, the correlations between temperature, pH and DO from the 23-yr historical simulation highlight how California's marine protected area network is unevenly distributed across upwelling intensities, with implications for organismal exposure to extremes. Marine protected areas located in areas of strong upwelling, which primarily occur in distinct regions of northern and central California are likely to experience concurrent exposure to low pH, low DO, and cooler temperatures, with similar event properties to those observed at Pt. Arena and Big Creek,respectively (Figs. 4,5). This contrasts with marine protected areas more weakly influenced by upwelling, primarily located in southern California and near San Francisco Bay, where exposure to extremes in lower pH, lower DO, or warmer temperatures are likely to be decoupled from one another. Given the lack of low pH and low DO events in the observational time series from the southern California sites, our findings suggest that these marine protected areas may be particularly susceptible to extreme warm temperatures, decoupled from low pH or low DO conditions. Finally, many marine protected areas were categorized as moderate upwelling sites. In these sites, exposures to pH, DO, and temperature are likely to co-vary during upwelling season, although with less extreme magnitudes in exposure compared to strong upwelling, but become decoupled in other times of the year. Importantly, strong, moderate, and weak upwelling marine protected areas were not randomly distributed across the coastline, but rather grouped into distinct subregions. This has important implications for the source and sink dynamics of the marine protected area network, as well as species undergoing range shifts in response to climate change. As larvae or propagules disperse or adults move from one marine protected area into another nearby protected area, these species are likely to experience similar extremes and covariance in temperature, pH and DO. However, larvae, propagules or adults moving long distances or among regions could potentially experience very different exposures to extremes.",False,False,False,

In addition, understanding the long-term evolution of ocean acidification and deoxygenation and heat waves at local scales requires high-resolution downscaled climate projections, whose reliability to predict future conditions greatly depends on their ability to reproduce past observed conditions. Promoting research that favors aggregation of existing nearshore pH and DO observations and develops synergies with ongoing regional modeling efforts should be a high priority.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) play an important role in the distribution and cycling of trace metals in the ocean, as important sources of metals including Fe and Mn, and also as possible sinks of chalcophile elements such as Cd. The Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ is one of the three largest ODZs worldwide. Here, we present results from two sectional surveys through the ETNP ODZ conducted in 2018, providing high-resolution concentrations of several metals, along with complimentary measurements of nutrients and iodine speciation. We show that samples obtained from the ship's regular rosette are clean for Cd, Mn, Ni, and light rare earth elements, while uncontaminated Fe, Zn, Cu, and Pb samples cannot be obtained without a special trace-metal clean sampling system. Our results did not show evidence of Cd sulfide precipitation, even within the most oxygen-depleted water mass. High Mn and Ce concentrations and high Ce anomalies were observed in lowoxygen seawater. These maxima were most pronounced in the upper water column below the oxycline, coincident with the secondary nitrite maxima and the lowest oxygen concentrations, in what is generally considered the most microbially active part of the water column. High Mn and Ce features were also coincident with maxima in excess iodine, a tracer of shelf sediment sources. Mn and Ce maxima were most prominent within the 13 C water mass, spanning a density horizon that enhances isopycnal transport from the shelf sediments, resulting in transport of Mn and Ce at least 2500 km offshore.Oxygen-deficient zones (ODZs) are regions with extremely low oxygen concentrations in subsurface waters, due to the high primary productivity in surface seawater and the intense subsurface remineralization that consumes oxygen. ODZs play an important role in the global nitrogen cycle as ""hot spots"" of fixed nitrogen loss and nitrous oxide (N 2 O, a potent greenhouse gas) production (Pierotti and Rasmussen 1980;Knowles 1982;Chang et al. 2012). In addition to their crucial",False,False,False,

role in the marine nitrogen cycle, ODZs can influence the exchange of metals between continental margins and ocean basins (Lam et al. 2020;Moffett and German 2020). Therefore, it is important to study trace metal cycling in ODZs because many trace metals-including Fe, Mn, Cu, Co, Zn, and Cdare required as cofactors for various enzymes and are essential micronutrients to phytoplankton, and thus also influence the global carbon and nitrogen cycles (Morel et al. 2003).",False,False,False,
966,10.1002/lno.12287,2,True,"ODZs can influence metal cycling in different ways. ODZs are often associated with elevated concentrations of redoxsensitive elements, such as Mn, Fe, Ce, and Co, because their reduced forms are much more soluble than their corresponding oxidized forms in seawater (Moffett and Ho 1996;Liu and Millero 2002;Morton et al. 2019). These redox-sensitive trace metals are often co-enriched in lowoxygen seawater and exhibit similar biogeochemical features. In particular, cerium (Ce) is known to resemble Mn in its marine chemistry (Moffett 1990(Moffett , 1994)). Ce is one of the rare earth elements (REEs). Although most REEs exist in the +3 oxidation state (de Baar et al. 1988), Ce (III) can be microbially oxidized to Ce (IV), followed by preferential scavenging of Ce (IV) from oxic waters by Mn oxidizing bacteria, leading to Ce depletion with respect to its lanthanide neighbors such as La, Pr, and Nd (Moffett 1990). In ODZs, these redox sensitive elements can be released from shelf sediments and transported by low-oxygen water masses away from the coastlines into the oceans, where they can be an important trace metal source for phytoplankton and alleviate the limitation stress of essential elements, particularly Fe (Bruland et al. 2005;Lam and Bishop 2008;Hawco et al. 2016). Some trace metals are not redox sensitive, but have been proposed to be influenced by the sulfur cycle in ODZs (Canfield et al. 2010), specifically chalcophile elements that tend to form metal sulfides. This hypothesis-that Cd is lost from water column as Cd sulfide (CdS) in anoxic microenvironments in organic particles-has been most commonly advanced to explain Cd and Cd isotope patterns in ODZs (Janssen et al. 2014;Conway and John 2015a), with implications for understanding both the modern ocean Cd cycle (Roshan and DeVries 2021), and the use of Cd/Ca ratios in foraminiferal records as a paleoceanographic proxy for dissolved phosphate to reconstruct water mass distribution and nutrient utilization in past oceans (Boyle 1988;Elderfield and Rickaby 2000). However, several recent studies reported that CdS precipitation was not observed in other ODZ regions (John et al. 2018;Yang et al. 2018;de Souza et al. 2022), indicating that CdS precipitation is not a driving mechanism that controls the global Cd cycling.",False,False,False,

Another main purpose of these cruises was to study the distribution of oxygen and nitrogen chemistry in the region as part of a 50-yr time series study of the biogeochemistry and physical boundaries of the denitrifying regime in the region (Brandes et al. 1998;Fuchsman et al. 2018). Compared with abundant studies on oxygen and nitrogen chemistry, the trace metal data are scarce in the ETNP ODZ. A recent Cd study has also called for higher-resolution data in the ETNP (de Souza et al. 2022). In this study, we adopted a sampling strategy that provided an unprecedented opportunity for high-resolution sampling in the region for trace metal studies. Complimentary measurements of iodine speciation and nitrite are also available (Evans et al. 2020;Moriyasu et al. 2020), providing valuable context for the trace metals studied here. The new high-resolution data presented in this study will provide valuable information to assess the CdS hypothesis and deepen our understanding of the cycling of Cd, Mn, and Ce in the ocean.",False,False,False,

## Sampling
The samples were collected during two cruises of the R/V Roger Revelle, RR1804 and RR1805 in the ETNP Ocean, 23N-14N, 105W-130W, from March to April 2018. The RR1804 cruise was comprised of one zonal and one meridional section (Fig. 1).The collection of contamination-free seawater can be challenging because of the extremely low concentrations of these elements in seawater, and the ubiquity of these elements in sampling platforms on a ship (e.g., dust, steel hydrowire, brass fittings, etc.) (Bruland and Lohan 2003;Measures et al. 2008). Trace-metal clean (TMC) sampling techniques have been standardized to avoid the contamination during sample collection (De Baar et al. 2008;Measures et al. 2008;Cutter et al. 2017). Such techniques rely on special sampling systems designed specifically for TMC sample collection, including Tefloncoated or metal-free bottles of the GO-FLO (General Oceanics) or external-spring configuration, mounted on a rosette made from titanium or powder-coated aluminum, and deployed from a nonmetallic liquid crystal polymer (e.g., Vectran) or polyethylene line (Measures et al. 2008;Cutter and Bruland 2012;Cutter et al. 2017).",False,False,False,

The samples were then left to sit overnight before they were preconcentrated by seaFAST™ system. The seaFAST™ system preconcentrates the seawater samples and removes the salt matrix (Lagerström et al. 2013). About 10 mL of seawater was injected through the Nobias PA-1 column on the seaFAST™, and 0.5 mL eluent (1 M HNO 3 containing 1 ppb In) was used to elute trace metals for concentration analysis.

Hydrologic background in the ETNP ODZ The region is characterized by high primary production in surface waters and a strong gradient in oxygen concentrations below the euphotic zone. A broad ODZ is observed in the water column between $ 200 and 800 m depth, with [O 2 ] mostly in the suboxic range (< 5 μmol kg À1 ) (Fig. 2b). Above the ODZ lies the upper oxycline, between $ 50 and 200 m depth (Fig. 2b). The lowest oxygen, and most intense denitrification, occurs in the upper part of this zone (Tiano et al. 2014;Fuchsman et al. 2018). There is a pronounced secondary nitrite maximum in this region over a density range of 26.2 to 26.6. This corresponds with a local maximum in salinity ($ 34.8 psu) corresponding to the 13 C water mass (13CW) (Fiedler and Talley 2006), a narrow feature which comprises the most microbially active region of denitrification in both the north and south eastern tropical Pacific (Peters et al. 2018;Evans et al. 2020). The situation is complicated because of another water mass, the Northern Equatorial Pacific Intermediate Water (NEPIW), which has a slightly higher oxygen concentration than the 13CW and lies underneath it. The boundary between them can be perturbed by eddies, leading to apparent complexity in nitrite distributions (Evans et al. 2020). The 13CW has outsized importance because the density range from 26.2 to 26.6 intersects with the majority of the continental shelf in Peru and Mexico. The persistence of the water mass facilitates isopycnal transport from waters overlying shelf sediments to the interior of the ODZ. This is apparent for iodide, with a large plume of ""excess"" iodide (i.e., concentrations exceeding the conservative seawater iodine concentration) forming large offshore plumes (Moriyasu et al. 2020). These excess iodide concentrations were measured on cruise RR1804, providing a direct comparison with the metal concentrations shown here.",False,False,False,

We collected trace metal samples from the RR1804 cruise using the ship's regular CTD rosette and Niskin bottles, which is not a standard TMC sampling technique. But previous studies have shown that ship's regular sampling system can be clean for some trace metals, such as Mn, Cd, and Nd (Janssen et al. 2014;Huang et al. 2021;Zhang et al. 2021). In order to assess the cleanliness of the ship's regular sampling system, we compared the RR1804 concentrations with those of RR1805-when a TMC sampling technique was used. There are no crossover stations between RR1804 and RR1805. RR1805 stations are all near the shore. So, we split RR1804 samples into near-shore and offshore stations (Fig. 1) and focused more on the comparison between the RR1804 nearshore stations and RR1805 stations. We used two criteria to evaluate the cleanliness of the ship's regular sampling system:
(1) the similarity between concentration profiles from RR1804 and RR1805, and (2) the lowest and highest concentrations    2). Based on these two criteria, we found that Cd, Ni, Mn, and LREEs (e.g., Ce) were clean, whereas Fe, Zn, Cu, and Pb were contaminated.",False,False,False,
977,10.1002/lno.12287,13,True,"Our results show that the Cd and Ni exhibit typical nutrient-type profiles (Sclater et al. 1976;Bruland 1980;Biller and Bruland 2012), and the Cd and Ni concentration profiles of non-TMC samples match those of TMC samples very well (Fig. 3), indicating that Cd and Ni are not contaminated using the regular CTD rosette and Niskin bottles. For the RR1804 seawater samples, the lowest Cd concentration of surface seawater is 0.00 nmol L À1 (below the detection limit, see Table 1) and the lowest Ni concentration of surface seawater is 2.31 nmol L À1 (Table 2), both are similar to Cd and Ni concentrations of the oligotrophic surface seawater and again indicate that Cd and Ni are not contaminated. For RR1804 samples, there are 6 Ni data points deviating from the main trendline of the Ni profile at a sigma-theta of $ 26.5, which might reflect the Ni-related redox processes. However, a recent study showed that Ni is not influenced by redox processes in the ETNP ODZ (Yang et al. 2021). Therefore, these Ni concentration outliers most likely result from contamination of Ni during sampling and/or analysis. We chose to present these outliers to better reflect the cleanliness of the regular CTD rosette sampling.",False,True,False,
978,10.1002/lno.12287,14,True,"The Mn profiles from RR1804 show relatively high Mn concentrations in surface waters, a Mn maximum in the subsurface  seawater (at a sigma-theta of $ 26.3), and the lowest Mn in deep water where the Mn concentration can be as low as 0.21 nmol L À1 (Fig. 3; Table 2). The Mn profiles of the RR1805 stations are very similar to the RR1804 profiles, especially those from the RR1804 near-shore stations (Fig. 3). However, it is worth noting that seawater samples from the RR1805 cruise have even higher Mn concentrations than RR1804 samples (Fig. 3; Table 2), which we attribute to Stas. P1 to P4 being closer to the shelf. Overall, the similarity between RR1804 and RR1805 samples, and the extreme depletion of Mn in deep water, show that Mn-clean samples can be collected using the non-TMC sampling system. The profiles of Ce are very similar to those of Mn. Data on LREEs are not available for RR1805, but the lowest Ce concentration of RR1804 samples is 0.6 pmol L À1 , indicating that Ce and other LREEs (La, Pr, and Nd) can also be sampled cleanly using the regular CTD rosette. Fe, Zn, Cu, and Pb appear to be contaminated using the regular CTD rosette, based on a comparison between RR1804 and RR1805 data. Fe and Zn are obviously contaminated. Both the lowest and highest Fe and Zn concentrations of RR1804 samples are much higher than those of RR1805 samples (Fig. 3; Table 2). The highest Fe (129.85 nmol L À1 ) and Zn (107.43 nmol L À1 ) concentrations of RR1804 samples are much higher than typically reported for the global ocean (Schlitzer et al. 2018). Even the median value of the RR1804 Fe concentrations is higher than typical open ocean seawater; the median value of RR1804 Zn is similar to the deep ocean Zn concentration (Table 2) (Schlitzer et al. 2018). Cu is less obviously contaminated, with many of the RR1804 samples having concentrations similar to RR1805 samples. However, there is clearly at least sporadic contamination, with some RR1804 samples having Cu concentrations above 10 nmol L À1 , which is not consistent with oceanographic observations (Schlitzer et al. 2018). Finally, the case for Pb contamination during sampling is the most ambiguous, with most of the RR1804 samples have concentrations slightly higher than RR1805 samples; however, there is clearly at least sporadic contamination, with some RR1804 samples having Pb concentrations much higher than RR1805 samples above 100 pmol L À1 . Moreover, the repeatability of Pb concentrations between the samples collected at the Fig. 3. Trace metal concentrations compared between samples taken on the RR1804 cruise using a non-TMC sampling system, and those from the RR1805 cruise, where a TMC sampling system was employed. Note that the concentrations of Fe, Zn, and Cu are shown on a logarithmic scale. RR1804 samples were split into near-shore (light red circles) and offshore (light gray circles) samples.

However, in this study, several factors limited our assessment of the cleanliness of the ship's regular sampling system, including a lack of the intercomparison between the TMC sampling and non TMC sampling from crossover stations and replicate analysis by other labs.

980,10.1002/lno.12287,16,True,"## Cd in the ETNP ODZ
The distribution of Cd is similar on both the zonal and meridional sections of the RR1804 cruise. Dissolved Cd (dCd) concentrations are extremely low in surface seawater and increase with depth (Figs. 3, 4). Around the halocline and oxycline, dCd increases rapidly from surface to subsurface waters.The Cd* of surface seawater is about À0.05 nmol L À1 in the ETNP. Considering that Cd is extremely depleted in surface seawater, this simply reflects near-quantitative biological uptake of both Cd and phosphate. There is a negative excursion of Cd* around the oxycline at the sigma-theta of $ 25 kg m À3 , where the Cd* can be as low as $ À0.40 nmol L À1 . Below the oxycline, Cd* increases with depth (Figs. 4, 5).Among all the water masses in the ETNP ODZ, 13CW has the lowest oxygen concentration (less than 1 μmol kg À1 ) and serves as the best candidate to study the CdS hypothesis. 13CW is characterized by a low oxygen concentration (< 1 μmol kg À1 ) and a high salinity ($ 34.8 psu), so both oxygen and salinity sections were plotted to help identify it (Fig. 4). The average Cd* of 13CW is À0.06 AE 0.06 nmol L À1 (2SD, n = 30) and its average dissolved oxygen concentration is 0.79 AE 0.42 μmol kg À1 . The average Cd* of water samples with oxygen concentrations less than 1 μmol kg À1 is À0.11 AE 0.14 nmol L À1 (2SD, n = 137). These average values are not distinguishable from the Cd* of oxic surface waters, which is about À0.05 nmol L À1 (Fig. 5), indicating no obvious loss of Cd compared to phosphate in the oxygen-deficient seawater in the ETNP.",False,False,False,
981,10.1002/lno.12287,17,True,"Prevalent negative Cd* values are observed around the oxycline (also halocline) above the ODZ in the ETNP (Figs. 4,5). Negative Cd* values can result from several potential mechanisms, such as (1) a higher Cd : PO 3À 4 export ratio (i.e., preferential uptake of Cd relative to phosphate) in surface seawater (Löscher et al. 1998;Elderfield and Rickaby 2000;Cullen 2006); (2) a deeper remineralization of Cd than PO 3À 4 (Wu and Roshan 2015); and (3) CdS precipitation (Janssen et al. 2014). Near the oxycline, some of the very negative Cd* values (< À0.25 nmol L À1 ) seem to be related to the Pacific Subarctic Upper Water (Fig. 5). These negative Cd* values may be related to the preformed Cd* of surface waters in the highnutrient, low-chlorophyll subarctic North Pacific, where preferential uptake of Cd relative to phosphate has been observed (Löscher et al. 1998;Cullen 2006;Janssen et al. 2017). There are a few samples with extremely low Cd* values (around À0.40 nmol L À1 ). These low Cd* values cannot be explained by the preformed Cd* signature alone, and they may result from the preferential remineralization of PO 4 3À compared to
Cd above the ODZ. This is consistent with previous studies showing that the more labile portion of bound P is remineralized faster than Cd at shallow depths in the euphotic zone (Bourne et al. 2018).",False,False,False,
982,10.1002/lno.12287,18,True,"The Cd* minimum is also associated with the oxycline in the open tropical South Pacific (John et al. 2018;Sieber et al. 2019;de Souza et al. 2022). Our data confirmed this feature in the ETNP. Thus, the Cd* minimum is associated with the oxycline throughout the tropics; the explanation of this feature remains a mystery but may be attributable to the presence of heterotrophic prokaryotes and low-light-adapted autotrophic prokaryotes (Ohnemus et al. 2019;de Souza et al. 2022). Future work is required to fully understand the mechanism(s) of the tropical Cd loss, particularly by combining trace metal studies with microbial biological studies through 'omics approaches, as has been suggested by de Souza et al. (2022).Although the ETNP ODZ seems to be a promising region to seek confirmation of the CdS hypothesis, due to the extreme depletion of oxygen in this region, we do not find that Cd is depleted relative to phosphate within the most oxygendeficient ([O 2 ] < 1 μmol kg À1 ) waters, and thus we do not find evidence to support precipitation of CdS within ODZs. Our work joins a growing body of literature suggesting that CdS precipitation does not greatly impact Cd distribution in the oceans (John et al. 2018;Yang et al. 2018;de Souza et al. 2022).",False,False,False,
983,10.1002/lno.12287,19,True,"## Manganese cycling in the ETNP ODZ
Depth profiles of dissolved Mn in the ocean typically display surface enrichments attributable to external input sources (primarily aerosol deposition and riverine input), and a relative depletion of Mn at depth due to scavenging (Landing and Bruland 1980;Shiller 1997;Boyle et al. 2005). Although we did observe a surface enrichment of Mn in the ETNP, this enrichment is small compared to the subsurface maximum of Mn within the ODZ (Fig. 6a,e).For the zonal section of Mn, extending westward from near the continental margin into the North Pacific, the subsurface Mn plume exhibits a wedge shape (Fig. 6a). At Sta. 30 near the coast, high Mn concentrations extend throughout the water column from 100 to 800 m depth. Moving offshore, further away from the coast, less and less high-Mn seawater is observed at depth. At Sta. 22, the most offshore station, high-Mn seawater is confined to $ 200 m depth. The distribution of low-oxygen seawater (< 4 μmol kg À1 [O 2 ]) along this same zonal section exhibits a similar wedge shape to Mn (Fig. 6a), such that low oxygen concentrations correspond to high Mn concentrations, and vice versa.Mn is released from sediments during early diagenesis (Froelich et al. 1979;Sundby et al. 1986), as are other metals including Fe, Co, and Ce (Bruland and Lohan 2003;Noble et al. 2012;Morton et al. 2019), and sedimentary release is the likely source of Mn in the subsurface plume. In the ETNP, the California Undercurrent flows poleward near the continental shelf, generating mesoscale subsurface eddies that transport 13CW water westwards (Evans et al. 2020) to facilitate the offshore transportation of Mn and other trace metals.",False,False,False,
984,10.1002/lno.12287,20,True,"There is an overall pattern of decreasing Mn away from the continental margin, but there are three hotspots with higher Mn concentrations observable in the zonal section, centered at roughly 125 W, 118 W, and 112 W (Fig. 6a). Each of these locations also has a high percentage of 13CW based on a water mass analysis of this zonal transect (Evans et al. 2020). Among them, the hotspot at Sta. 28 near 112 W has the highest percentage of 13CW (80-100%), whereas the percentages of 13CW in the other two hotspots are between 60% to 80%. This likely explains why the high-Mn hotspot near 112 W has a higher Mn concentration. Regions of high Mn concentrations are also generally coincident with the secondary nitrite maxima and elevated iodide concentrations (Fig. 6b,c). The nitrite enrichment is often attributed to the active microbial nitrogen cycle processes. Elevated iodide concentrations, in particular those exceeding the average total inorganic iodine amount (470 nmol L À1 ) in the ocean (i.e., excess iodine) (Luther III et al. 1995), not only reflect in situ iodate reduction, but also are derived from the lateral advection of iodide from reducing shelf sediments (Farrenkopf and Luther 2002;Cutter et al. 2018;Moriyasu et al. 2020). This indicates that Mn and iodide share the same sedimentary source, and both the overall pattern of high Mn concentrations between roughly 100 and 400 m depth, as well as the higher Mn concentrations in ""hotspots"" can be attributed to the westward transportation of 13CW by subsurface eddies (Fig. 7), although the importance of in situ microbial redox processes cannot be neglected.",False,False,False,
985,10.1002/lno.12287,21,True,"Oxygen concentrations appear to be a key control on the concentration of Mn in the ETNP ODZ. High Mn concentrations (> 2 nmol L À1 ) are only observed where dissolved oxygen concentrations are less than 4 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 6a,e). At Sta. 19, seawater with an oxygen concentration of $ 4 μmol kg À1 intrudes upwards into the overlying low-oxygen seawater, which is consistent with the upwelling of NEPIW into 13CW (Evans et al. 2020). Waters with a higher oxygen concentration and higher NEPIW percentage also have distinctly lower Mn concentrations. The increase in oxygen is modest (from < 1 to 4 μmol kg À1 ). However, it appears that Mn is so sensitive to oxygen that it can be influenced by even small increases in oxygen concentration. Besides oxygen concentrations, 13CW and NEPIW also have different water mass sources, different trajectories that transport them to the ETNP ODZ, and different interactions with the shelf within the ODZ. All these factors could result in the difference in their Mn concentrations.",False,False,False,
986,10.1002/lno.12287,22,True,"The insight provided by the zonal section makes it easier to interpret observations on the meridional section. Subsurface Mn maxima are also observed on the meridional section, characterized by two hotspots, one near Sta. 9 centered at roughly 18 N and the other one near Sta. 3 centered at roughly 22 N (Fig. 6e). The hotspot at Sta. 9 is the same hotspot as observed at Sta. 28 in the zonal section (Fig. 6a,e), suggesting that both hotspots on the meridional section likely originate from  , 6e), but is associated with oxygen concentrations higher than 4 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 6e). This indicates that the low Mn region is formed by removing the oxygen-sensitive Mn that originates from the continental shelf input. Ce cycling in the ETNP ODZ In the ETNP, Ce and Ce anomaly are highly correlated with Mn concentrations (Fig. 7), and sections of Mn, Ce, and Ce anomaly are quite similar (Fig. 6a-c,e-g). A high correlation between Mn and Ce has also been observed in other regions, such as the Cariaco Trench (de Baar et al. 1988), off the African shelf (Zheng et al. 2016), and in the Arabian Sea (Floback and Moffett 2021). In the zonal section, the Ce anomaly values in the subsurface Ce plume are higher than surface Ce anomaly values (Fig. 6b,c), probably indicating that surface and subsurface Ce have different sources and/or undergo different degrees of in situ redox processes. Considering the correlation between Ce and Mn, we assume that shelf input probably is also the main source of subsurface Ce. Eolian and riverine input are likely the main sources of surface Ce and they are characterized by a weak or the absence of Ce depletion relative to the neighboring REEs (Goldstein and Jacobsen 1988;Greaves et al. 1994). Photoreduction of manganese oxides in surface seawater may also contribute to the supply of Ce to surface seawater (Sunda et al. 1983).",False,False,False,
987,10.1002/lno.12287,23,True,"Although there is an overall similarity between Mn and Ce in the ETNP ODZ, there are still some noteworthy differences between the two. Mn concentrations decrease abruptly when oxygen concentrations are above 4 μmol kg À1 , while relatively high Ce concentrations can still be observed in the regions where oxygen concentrations are higher than 4 μmol kg À1 and Mn is depleted (Fig. 6a,b,e,f), suggesting differences in their removal from seawater in the presence of oxygen. The observation here is consistent with previous studies showing that microbial Mn oxidation is three times faster than microbial Ce oxidation (Moffett 1990). This pattern is also observed in Mn/Ce ratios. In the zonal section of Mn/Ce, high Mn/Ce ratios are observed near the coast and lower Mn/Ce ratios are observed at higher oxygen concentrations (Fig. 6d), indicating that Mn is removed from seawater more rapidly than Ce when oxygen concentrations increase in the ODZ seawater. In the meridional section of Mn/Ce, a striking feature is that in the ODZ, almost all the regions with high Mn/Ce ratios (> 0.5 nmol/pmol) are associated with oxygen concentrations less than 1 μmol kg À1 (Fig. 6h). The Mn/Ce ratios of the lowest-oxygen seawater (< 1 μmol kg À1 ) in the meridional section are similar to the shelf Mn/Ce ratio in the zonal section, indicating that Mn and Ce in the low-oxygen seawater originate at the continental shelf.",False,False,False,

Hydrothermal waters are usually characterized by elevated Mn and REE concentrations, and the absence of a Ce anomaly (i.e., Ce/Ce* = 1) (Douville et al. 1999;Resing et al. 2015). Although suspended particles or dissolved metals from the underwater eruptions would have been advected away long ago, diagenesis of reduced materials deposited on the island's flanks may continue to supply material to the water column. Therefore, it is possible that the volcanic features of Mn and Ce from the underwater eruptions three decades ago are still partially preserved here.",False,False,False,

Our new results presented here, combined with the distribution of iodine species (Moriyasu et al. 2020) and water mass analysis (Evans et al. 2020), suggest that lateral inputs of various elements within the ODZ are important throughout the ETNP. Elevated plumes of Mn and Ce are associated with a discrete water mass (13CW) and with subsurface eddies that transport materials offshore within the 13CW. ""Hotspots"" with elevated concentrations of Mn, Ce, and iodine were observed on both transects and each was associated with high percentages of 13CW water. The origin of the enrichments within the hotspots cannot be determined conclusively, but the co-variation with excess iodine suggests that they originate from benthic inputs at continental margins.Shelf-released Mn is extremely sensitive to oxygen, such that dissolved Mn appears to be quickly removed from ODZ seawater when dissolved oxygen concentrations increase to $ 4 μmol kg À1 . The concentrations of Ce are also lower in ODZ seawater at higher [O 2 ], though Ce appears to be less quickly lost when small amounts of oxygen (> $4 μmol kg À1 ) are present.We do not find that Cd is depleted relative to phosphate within the most oxygen-deficient ([O 2 ] < 1 μmol kg À1 ) waters of the ETNP ODZ, and thus we do not find evidence to support precipitation of CdS within ODZs. Low Cd* values are observed in the ETNP around the oxycline, which may be related to the preformed Cd* signal of seawater originating from the subarctic North Pacific, and the preferential remineralization of PO 3À 4 compared to Cd above the ODZ. Future studies are required to fully understand the mechanisms of the Cd loss in the oxycline throughout the tropics.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
In natural systems, animal-mediated nutrient transport can be a major driver of primary productivity, but the role of marine megafauna such as cetaceans in mediating the transfer and recycling of nutrients has been overlooked. Here, we developed a spatially resolved, stochastic, nutrient-transport model for cetaceans in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico using speciesÀspecific foraging depths, distributions, and diets. An estimated 6.4 Â 10 8 mmol N d À1 , or 0.06 mt N yr À1 ind À1 , is transported to the surface from depths below 100 m by the 19 cetacean species that occur in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico; 75% of this transport occurs seaward of the continental slope, but the per area transported nitrogen is greater on the continental slope (200-1000 m) than in the ocean basin. Benthos to surface transport comprised 6.0 Â 10 7 mmol N d À1 and was much more common on the continental slope than the open basin. Compared to an existing physical-biogeochemical model, the transported nutrients add 8% N d À1 to the estimated ammonium concentration above the nutricline and could add 16% N d À1 to the surface ammonium concentration if expelled nutrients remain at the surface. Through feeding on diel vertical migrants, cetaceans retain an additional 2.7 Â 10 7 mmol N d À1 in the surface waters that would otherwise return to depth via downward diel vertical migration. Cetaceans contribute to nutrient movements and recycling in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico, and may provide one of the few allochthonous sources of nutrients for primary producers in oligotrophic ecosystems.",False,False,False,

Due to their movements within and across ecosystem boundaries (from a donor to a recipient system), animals can transport nutrients and affect ecosystem dynamics, both in terrestrial and aquatic habitats (Gravel et al. 2010;Roman and McCarthy 2010;Doughty et al. 2016). In marine ecosystems, animals can transfer nutrients and potentially enhance primary production in both coastal (Meyer et al. 1983;Nelson et al. 2012;Allgeier et al. 2013) and open-ocean ecosystems (Hern andez-Le on et al. 2008). Open-ocean ecosystems receive limited amount of nutrient runoff from land, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions (Opsahl and Benner 1997). Therefore, consumer-mediated nutrient transport may help maintain open-ocean ecosystem productivity, but has largely been overlooked in the literature.",False,False,False,
1000,10.1002/lno.12433,2,True,"Cetaceans have high per capita consumption and metabolic rates. This leads to potentially high local and regional abundances during periods of high primary productivity (Roman et al. 2014;Kiszka et al. 2015). In oceanic zones, cetaceans frequently dive deep (> 200 m) to feed on mesopelagic and bathypelagic nekton (Watwood et al. 2006;Gallo-Reynoso et al. 2009;Stimpert et al. 2014). Diel differences in diving behavior indicate that certain species target deep-scattering layers, which ascend to the surface during the night (i.e., diel vertical migration; Benoit-Bird and Au 2003;Soldevilla et al. 2017). In some cases, individuals may dive to the benthos to consume benthic and demersal prey (Fitch and Brownell Jr. 1968;Davis et al. 2006;Spitz et al. 2011). When cetaceans ascend to the surface to breathe, they are expected to release most of their nitrogen ingested at depth, due to higher metabolism in shallow waters, less hydrostatic pressure, and decreased urine flow during dives (Kooyman et al. 1981; Katona and Whitehead 1988;Ortiz 2001). Although it is well understood that animal movement can supplement the amount of available nutrients in a recipient system, the roles that cetaceans have in trophic coupling are not well understood in marine ecosystems, particularly in the open ocean (Kiszka et al. 2022).",False,False,False,

Even though 80% of the nutrients coming from the shelf may be denitrified prior to export beyond the 50-m isobath (Xue et al. 2013), the amount that is advected may provide more than 90% of the open-ocean nitrogen in the Gulf of Mexico (Kelly et al. 2021). However, current biogeochemical (BGC) models in the region do not include the contribution of cetaceans (Shropshire et al. 2020;Wang et al. 2020), which excrete ammonium (NH 4 + ) that can be readily assimilated, both through excretion and egestion.

In this study, we developed a model to estimate the daily amounts of nitrogen vertically transported by cetaceans in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico.

Additionally, to determine the relationship between species' habitat preferences and the magnitude of nutrient transport among meso-(water column 200-1000 m depths), bathy-(water column deeper than 1000 m depth), and benthopelagic layers, we compared oceanic (seaward of the 1000-m isobath) and continental slope (200-1000 m depth) regions. Finally, we discuss the available surface nitrogen concentrations throughout the oceanic Gulf of Mexico from an existing BGC model (Wang et al. 2020).",False,False,False,

## Model initialization
We developed a nutrient-transport model to estimate the amount of nitrogen vertically transported in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico. The model domain included the entire Gulf of Mexico large marine ecosystem, seaward of the 200-m isobath. A small portion of the Caribbean Sea was included within the study area based on a habitat suitability model recently developed for the region (Ramírez-Le on et al. 2021). The continental shelf region (landward of 200-m isobath) was not included in this analysis because of the importance of the continental shelf break in dividing cetacean stocks and species' distributions (Maze-Foley and Mullin 2006;Ramírez-Le on et al. 2021), making these regions distinct from an ecological standpoint. The model consisted of 19 cetacean species (Table 1), with species' abundances simulated as random integers from lognormal distributions. Abundance means, abundance minimums, and coefficients of variation (CV) were collated from the latest NOAA stock assessments (Hayes et al. 2019). The abundance minimums are a requirement by the Marine Mammal Protection Act as a ""reasonable"" minimum population estimate based on the best available data. Statistically, the abundance minimums were calculated as the 20th percentile of a lognormal distribution of population size (Hayes et al. 2019). The abundance estimates of pygmy (Kogia breviceps) and dwarf sperm whales (Kogia sima) were combined in this study because these species are often challenging to distinguish during abundance surveys. The stock assessments for all species were distinguished as either ""Gulf of Mexico stocks"" (e.g., sperm whale [Physeter macrocephalus]) or ""oceanic Gulf of Mexico stocks"" (common bottlenose dolphin [Tursiops truncatus]) that assumed the abundance estimate applies beyond the US Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) within the Gulf of Mexico. Each modeled abundance estimate was constrained by the minimum and maximum (mean + standard deviation) population sizes. This randomization and constraint process means that there were more simulations with modeled abundances near the minimum population size estimate than the maximum population size estimate, but was intended for all simulations to have a possible abundance (determined by stock assessment confidence intervals) and the mean species' abundance from all model iterations to closely represent the stock assessment mean population size. All species were divided into groups with group sizes determined by the means, and standard errors of group sizes in the Gulf of Mexico (Table 1; Maze-Foley and Mullin 2006). Each group was composed of one or more individuals of the same species that shared the same morphological and ecological characteristics (i.e., dive behavior, diet, and body size). Therefore, this model did not incorporate the size structure of each population, as this information was not available. Groups were assigned to a latitudeÀlongitude weighted by the results of a maximum entropy algorithm (MaxENT) habitat suitability model (Phillips et al. 2006;Ramírez-Le on et al. 2021). The MaxENT model used five environmental parameters (i.e., sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, depth, slope, and distance from the 200 m isobath) and historical georeferenced sighting data (from 1970 to 2010) to estimate the habitat preferences of 10 cetacean species in the nutrient model.

However, each group needed to be placed at a lat-itudeÀlongitude coordinate. Therefore, Rice's whales were restricted to the upper continental slope (200-400 m) of the DeSoto Canyon region bound by À87.5 W, À84.5 W, 26 N, and 30 N (Soldevilla et al. 2017). All beaked whales were assumed to have a similar distribution as Cuvier's beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris). The other four species without a habitat suitability map had an equal probability of occupying any latitudeÀlongitude within the model domain.

For each group, feeding and excretion events were simulated for one day at a one-minute temporal scale. Dive depths of each species were gathered from literature and designed to reflect diel differences in diving behavior and intervals (e.g., Rice's whale; Soldevilla et al. 2017), as well as feeding depths (Table 2). During the first timestep of the model (i.e., 00 : 01), each group dove to a random depth of the mean AE standard deviation and had a 5% chance of a deeper dive (i.e., up to maximum dive depth; Table 2). Deeper dives were included to assess the potential of cetaceans to make dives beyond their normal dive depths (Shearer et al. 2019). Dive and surface intervals (Table 2) were randomly selected with a Groups fed during each dive and the amount of prey consumed per feeding event was randomly sampled from a normal distribution divided by the number of dives per day (mean 3% predator weight consumed per day; the possible range of 1.5-4.5% predator weight consumed per day; Trites et al. 1997). This process assured that a group's individual meal sizes were different but constrained (between 1.5% and Table 2.

The number of dives per day was a speciesspecific parameter that was either derived from literature (Table 2) or calculated as a function of the number of minutes in a day (n = 1440 min) divided by the sum of the time spent in an average dive and surface intervals (Table 2). For example, if a species spends an average of 30 min per dive interval and 18 min per surface interval, the species would make 30 dives per day (1440/[30 + 18]). Although this process overestimates foraging time, the constraint of consumption rates restricts the cetaceans from consuming more nutrients than would be anticipated. Consumed biomass was converted to consumed nitrogen based on the species' diet (Table 1), time of day, foraging depths (range based on studies on the vertical movements of species investigated or dietary information from stomach content data) of each group, and nitrogen concentration of each prey taxon. During the day and at night, at depths > 200 m, consumed nitrogen (N 1 ) was calculated as a function of the biomass consumed per prey taxon (i.e., fish biomass consumed 1) and the nitrogen contents of fishes (N f ), cephalopods (N ce ), and crustaceans (N cr ; Eq. 1). The nitrogen contents of prey (N 1 ) were randomly chosen per model iteration from a normal distribution using the mean and standard deviation of protein concentration (% wet weight) for fishes (10 AE 3%; Stickney and Torres 1989), cephalopods (9 AE 2%; Sinclair et al. 2015), and crustaceans (9 AE 4%; Donnelly et al. 1993).

Thus, cetaceans feeding in the epipelagic zone at night consume vertically migrating deep-pelagic organisms, which have predominately excreted the food from their previous meal(s) (Merrett and Roe 1974). Therefore, we calculated the proportion of the nighttime, epipelagic prey field that was comprised of vertically migrating, deep-pelagic fishes (A f ), cephalopods (A ce ), and crustaceans (A cr ). From 2011 to 2018, micronekton were collected using a 10 m 2 multiple opening and closing environmental sensing system (MOCNESS) in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico aboard the research vessels Meg Skansi and Point Sur (Cook et al. 2020). The sampling design included day and night trawls at five discrete-depth bins (0-200 m, 200-600 m, 600-1000 m, 1000-1200 m, and 1200-1500 m) bound by À90 W, À84 W, 26 N, and 30 N. Nighttime, epipelagic, standardized abundance (n m À2 ) was calculated for each micronekton species caught during MOCNESS sampling. Each species was designated as either a diel vertical migrant or a non-migrant according to literature and trawl data. The proportion of the nighttime, epipelagic assemblage comprised of vertically migrating fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans was calculated. For each modeled cetacean group, the proportion of deep-pelagic fishes (A f ; 37 AE 3%), cephalopods (A ce ; 40 AE <0.01%), and crustaceans (A cr ; 53 AE 5%) in the epipelagic zone applied in the model was a random value sampled from a normal distribution driven by the mean and standard deviation of the netcaught assemblage to account for the likely variation in the prey assemblage on a nightly and spatial basis. The nitrogen consumed by cetaceans in the epipelagic zone at night (N 2 ) was calculated similarly to during the day and at deep depths (see Eq. 1), but with added factors to account for the proportion of the ingested nitrogen originated from deep-sea migrants (i.e., animals that occupy mesopelagic and bathypelagic depths during the day; Eq. 2).",False,False,False,

Although pinniped populations excrete 87% of the ingested nitrogen (Theobald et al. 2006), there is no quantitative analysis for cetacean populations and some nitrogen may be passively lost due to sinking (Roman and McCarthy 2010), so a conservative estimate was applied. The group-specific daily nitrogen excretion rate was calculated as the sum of all excretion events during the day. Six depth bins were considered to report the regions that nitrogen is transferred from: ""upper epipelagic"" (0-100 m), ""lower epipelagic"" (100-200 m), ""upper mesopelagic"" (200-600 m), ""lower mesopelagic"" (600-1000 m), ""bathypelagic"" (1000-maximum depth), and ""benthopelagic"" (maximum depth).

Only nitrogen derived from ammonium was considered in this study because it is assimilable by phytoplankton without nitrification. The BGC model ran from 2010 to 2015 and it was calibrated using BGC Argo float data, covering the entire Gulf of Mexico large marine ecosystem using a three-dimensional irregular grid with 36 depth observations at each latitudeÀlongitude (see Wang et al. 2020 for detailed information). Daily model output was available but did not contain the contribution of cetaceans to the nitrogen stock. Although whale fecal plumes are buoyant (Roman and McCarthy 2010), any delay in nutrient assimilation may allow for passive vertical mixing of nutrients. Therefore, two calculations were made to estimate the influence of the cetacean community on the ammonium stock; one that estimated the addition of nutrients above the nutricline (assuming passive mixing after release from cetaceans), and another that estimated the addition of nutrients only at the surface (assuming nutrients remained at the surface until assimilation). Both calculations were necessary because the post-excretion fate of nitrogen is enigmatic. For the first comparison, the daily nutricline was calculated at each latitudeÀlongitude, and the nitrogen concentrations (mmol N m À3 ) above the nutricline were averaged to represent a homogenous nitrogen distribution. Since the N cet did not account for seasonality (an assumption of the MaxENT model), an annual average nitrogen concentration was calculated for each lat-itudeÀlongitude. In the second comparison where cetaceans were assumed to excrete nitrogen at the surface, an annual average surface nitrogen concentration (mmol N m À3 ) was calculated for each latitudeÀlongitude at the shallowest depth layer. In both comparisons, the area (m 2 ) of each N cet grid cell was calculated using the greatest circle distance and the cetacean model results were converted to mmol N m À2 . Since excretion was assumed to occur at the surface waters (within the top meter of the water column), the mmol N m À2 transported by cetaceans was equivalent to mmol N m À3 .

## Community composition

Additionally, there may have been unquantified variance in abundance estimates due to unclear information about population size within the southern half of the Gulf of Mexico. The model was not sensitive to cetacean consumption rates, species' dive intervals, and mesopelagic taxon abundances (CV < 0.01 each).

1022,10.1002/lno.12433,24,True,"## Discussion
Our model successfully quantified the upward vertical nitrogen transport by cetaceans in the oceanic Gulf of Mexico. Including the nighttime feeding on vertically migrating mesopelagic organisms, an estimated 6.7 Â 10 8 AE 1.3 Â 10 8 mmol N d À1 (9.4 Â 10 3 AE 1.8 Â 10 3 kg N d À1 ) is mediated by cetaceans and 96% of this nitrogen originates from deeper than 100 m. Assuming there is no seasonal variation and cetaceans are year-round residents of the region (an assumption of stock assessments perpetuated by a lack of sighting data outside of the US EEZ), this equates to a yearly transport of 2.4 Â 10 11 AE 4.7 Â 10 10 mmol N yr À1 (3.4 Â 10 3 AE 6.6 Â 10 2 ). In the Gulf of Maine, cetaceans and pinnipeds add 2.3 Â 10 4 mt N yr À1 , enough to significantly increase the primary production in the region (Roman and McCarthy 2010). However, toothed cetaceans in the Gulf of Maine (n = 110,458 individuals) only contribute 12% of the daily nitrogen export, while pinnipeds (absent in the Gulf of Mexico) and baleen whales (only represented by Rice's whale in the Gulf of Mexico) contribute to the rest (Roman and McCarthy 2010). The per capita cetacean nitrogen export for in the Gulf of Mexico is 1.1 Â 10 4 AE 2.3 Â 10 3 mmol N ind À1 d À1 (0.15 AE 0.03 kg N d À1 ) is 3 and 2.1 times greater than the per capita nitrogen export rate for toothed cetaceans in the Gulf of Maine (0.05 kg N d À1 ; Roman and McCarthy 2010) and spinner dolphins in the Maldives and Chagos archipelagos (0.07 kg N d À1 ; Letessier et al. 2022), respectively. This is likely due to differences in odontocete community compositions and abundances between the three locations and the presence of deep-diving whales (particularly sperm whales) in the Gulf of Mexico. This study explicitly models the vertical nutrient transport of cetaceans in the Gulf of Mexico. Advances in our understanding of species and region-specific diving behaviors and diets would enhance future modeling efforts.",False,False,False,
1023,10.1002/lno.12433,25,True,"A small percentage (4%) of the cetacean-based nutrient transport occurred at night in the epipelagic zone, as many small delphinid species (e.g., Stenella sp.) are thought to forage at night in the region (with a few exceptions, such as Rice's whale; Soldevilla et al. 2017). Diel vertically migrating organisms actively transport nutrients from the epipelagic zones to deeper layers, and their alimentary canals (passage from prey ingestion to egestion) are generally empty by the time they migrate into the epipelagic zone again (Merrett and Roe 1974;Baird et al. 1975;Tyler and Pearcy 1975). Therefore, the ingestion of migrating organisms in the epipelagic zone serves to retain nutrients that would otherwise be excreted by migrants at deep depths. However, the periodicity of foraging by cetaceans in the open ocean is poorly understood and is not incorporated in the current version of this model. For example, short-finned pilot whales in the southern Gulf of Mexico may specifically feed in the morning hours (06:00 h-11:00 h; Pardo et al. 2021). The incorporation of feeding periodicity, if known, would not change the total amount of nitrogen predicted to be transported in this model, but would affect nitrogen retainment rates, as this is influenced by diel vertical migration. Additionally, the daytime and nighttime depths were similar for eight of the 19 species in this model. This distinction was based on observation for deep-diving whales (e.g., Cuvier's beaked whale; Shearer et al. 2019) and killer whales (Lauriano et al. 2020) but was assumed for other species (e.g., Fraser's dolphin) based on a lack of information. Small cetaceans foraging in the epipelagic zone still participate in vertical nutrient transport by consuming deep-pelagic micronekton and retaining nutrients in the near-surface waters, but information regarding foraging periods and diel diving behaviors is lacking for several species. In this model, the cetacean community contributed an additional 8% N d À1 (5.2 Â 10 À4 mmol N m À3 d À1 ) of nitrogen compared to the average NH 4 + stock shallower than the nutricline, and 16% N d À1 if just considering the surface layer. The variance in these estimates (< 1% to 45% above the nutricline, < 1% to 108% at the surface) is likely caused by cetacean distributions (Ramírez-Le on et al. 2021) and the localized nutrient conditions, which are affected by advected nutrient inputs from neritic regions, passive vertical mixing, and seasonal changes to the mixed layer depth (Müller-Karger et al. 1991; Xue et al. 2013). The nitrogen flux rate of the cetacean community in the open ocean (seaward of the 1000-m isobath; 0.47 μmol N m À2 d À1 ) and continental slope habitats (0.81 μmol N m À2 d À1 ) are similar to the passive vertical flux of nitrogen by turbulent diffusion (< 1 μmol N m À2 d À1 ; Kelly et al. 2021). Field-derived ammonium concentrations for the oceanic Gulf of Mexico averaged 0.06 mmol NH 4 + m À3 (range: $ 0.02-0.2 mmol m À3 NH 4 + ; approximated from Kelly et al. 2021), with no depth trend in the top 60 m. The field-derived value is an order of magnitude greater than the average biogeochemical-derived ammonium concentration value above the nutricline (0.008 AE 0.006 mmol NH 4 +
) and although it was possible for modeled ammonium concentrations to exist in the field-derived range, this phenomenon was not common (see Supporting Information Fig. S23). Nevertheless, the average lateral transport of particulate organic nitrogen from the continental shelf in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico is three orders of magnitude higher (1165 μmol N m À2 d À1 ) than the cetacean-mediated value (Kelly et al. 2021). This contrasts with the Gulf of Maine where the cetacean-mediated nitrogen influx is 1.8 times larger than the contribution by rivers (Roman and McCarthy 2010). Although the cetacean contribution may have little influence on the overall nutrient dynamics and primary production of the oceanic Gulf of Mexico, the cetacean contribution of ammonium provides a steady vertical nutrient flux to supplement regenerated production in oligotrophic ecosystems.",False,False,False,
1024,10.1002/lno.12433,26,True,"Overall, cetaceans contribute 6.0 Â 10 7 AE 1.6 Â 10 7 mmol N d À1 to benthos to surface transport (i.e., benthopelagic coupling), with 99% of this contribution on the continental slope (200-1000 m depth). This coupling is driven by habitat preference of many cetaceans in the Gulf of Mexico, particularly continental shelf margins, mainly due to higher productivity and prey availability (Baumgartner et al. 2001;Mullin et al. 2004;Grüss et al. 2018). Additionally, since this process is contingent on the cetaceans diving to the maximum depth, a reduction of benthopelagic coupling in the deeper open basin is expected. However, it is possible for benthopelagic coupling in the deep basin to occur through multiple trophic pathways, as deep-demersal fishes ascend off the bottom to feed on pelagic taxa (Drazen et al. 2001), entering the dive range of cetaceans, particularly deep-diving whales. The quantification of benthopelagic coupling is often focused on trophic interactions and fisheries in coastal regions (Marcus and Boero 1998;Agnetta et al. 2019).

Their frequent diving behavior to deeper layers and assumed ubiquitous distribution throughout the oceanic Gulf of Mexico (Davis et al. 1998;Maze-Foley and Mullin 2006) suggests that cetaceans provide positive feedback loops throughout the oligotrophic ocean basins via the influx of nutrients. This has also been suggested in other ecosystems for several large cetaceans, such as blue (Balaenoptera musculus) and sperm whales, supplementing iron concentrations and promoting primary production in the Southern Ocean (Lavery et al. 2010(Lavery et al. , 2014)). Advances in our understanding of the foraging behavior and activity of an increasing number of cetacean species, region-specific diets, nutrient assimilation proportions, and population age structure are necessary to better parameterize trait-based energetic models, such as that presented here.

## Abstract
The balance of physical and biological processes governing phytoplankton growth rates and the accumulation of biomass is widely debated in the literature, notably during the winter-spring transition. Here we show, in a temperate shelf sea that variability in the depth of the actively mixing surface layer is the leading order control. During a 2-week period preceding the peak of the spring bloom we observe two distinct regimes; first, growth within the euphotic zone during the day and re-distribution of new biomass to the seasonal pycnocline at night by convective mixing; then, more rapid biomass accumulation trapped within a shallower, wind-driven actively mixing layer that was decoupled from the pycnocline below. Our observations of the bloom in the Celtic Sea, Northwest European Shelf, were made using ocean gliders and include measurements of the dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy. A 1-D phytoplankton growth model driven by our measurements of dissipation and incident irradiance replicates the observed bloom and reinforces the conclusion that physical processes that mediate light availability were key. Day-to-day variability in cloud cover and the ability of phytoplankton to acclimate to their light environment were also important factors in determining growth rates, and the timing of the biomass peak. Our results emphasize the need for accurate turbulent mixing parameterizations in coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem models. Our findings are applicable to any region where wind-driven mixing can modify nutrient and light availability, especially across subpolar shelves in the northern hemisphere where light rather than nutrients is typically the limiting factor on phytoplankton growth.",False,False,False,

Marine phytoplankton are responsible for $ 50% of primary production on Earth and form the base of the global ocean food web (Field et al. 1998). Seasonal phytoplankton blooms make a significant contribution to oceanic primary production, air-sea CO 2 fluxes and carbon sequestration, as well as being key to the life cycles and trophic interactions of marine organisms (Lutz et al. 2007;Koeller et al. 2009;Signorini et al. 2012). Shelf seas contribute between 10% and 30% of global marine primary production, a disproportionately large contribution relative to their size (Mackenzie et al. 2005), they are a net sink for atmospheric carbon dioxide (Laruelle et al. 2018) and are responsible for up to 50% of the organic carbon supplied to the deep ocean (Jahnke 2010).",False,False,True,
1036,10.1002/lno.11734,2,True,"A bloom occurs when phytoplankton growth rates exceed losses such that a sustained period of growth leads to a (net) accumulation of biomass. Controls on growth rates include light availability, nutrient supply, and temperature, while losses may occur through mortality (e.g., grazing, viral lysis), advection, sinking or detrainment out of the euphotic zone. Hence, a range of biological and physical controls govern the balance between phytoplankton production and loss (see Lindemann and John 2014 for a review). Several hypotheses concerning the mechanisms for bloom initiation have emerged, with three main themes: critical depth, critical turbulence, and dilution re-coupling. While we do not implicitly test these hypotheses, we briefly review them here in order to provide the reader with an overview of the relevant physical and biological drivers behind increases in phytoplankton growth rates and the accumulation of biomass. Many of these drivers are relevant throughout the year, not just for spring bloom initiation. Sverdrup (1953) introduced the concept of a critical depth, based upon the assumption that phytoplankton growth was proportional to light, such that it decayed exponentially with depth, and that losses were constant throughout the water column. He defined a critical depth that needed to be deeper than the surface mixed layer for vertically integrated phytoplankton growth to outweigh losses. This evolved into the widely accepted view that the spring bloom is triggered once a seasonal surface mixed layer is established above the critical depth (e.g., Bishop et al. 1986;Siegel et al.. 2002). Conventional temperature or density thresholds for the depth of the surface mixed layer (de Boyer Montegut et al. 2004) however, do not always accurately represent the depth to which cells are actively mixed (Brainerd and Gregg 1995), which violates Sverdrup's assumption of a thoroughly well mixed layer.",False,False,False,
1037,10.1002/lno.11734,3,True,"The critical turbulence hypothesis proposes that a surface bloom can start in an arbitrarily deep surface mixed layer if the turbulence is weak enough in the well-lit surface waters for phytoplankton to receive sufficient light before being mixed down beneath the critical depth, or when an intensely mixed surface layer shoals, exposing phytoplankton to favorable light conditions (Huisman et al. 1999;Waniek 2003). A bloom can therefore potentially start in the winter following the shutdown of deep convective mixing and before onset of the mixed layer in spring (Townsend et al. 1994;Taylor and Ferrari 2011;Ferrari et al. 2015). Decreases in turbulence are typically attributed to net surface warming and reduced wind stress (Chiswell 2011;Taylor and Ferrari 2011;Chiswell et al. 2013). Later, Brody and Lozier (2014) proposed that a decrease in the dominant mixing length scale from deep winter convection to a shallower wind mixing regime above the compensation depth (where net phytoplankton growth is zero) is a reliable condition for the initiation of the spring bloom. Such conditions can occur when surface heat fluxes are still negative (i.e., convective), the seasonal thermocline is deep or when stratification is still weak. In subtropical regions, where nutrient availability rather than light is the limiting factor on phytoplankton growth, mixed layer deepening during the winter provides an essential injection of nutrients that may stimulate high enough growth rates to support an increase in biomass throughout the entire, deepening mixed layer (Zarubin et al. 2017).",False,False,False,
1038,10.1002/lno.11734,4,True,"In addition to a thoroughly well-mixed surface layer, Sverdrup also assumed a constant loss rate with depth (encompassing respiration, grazing, viral lysis, and sinking). The dilution re-coupling hypothesis (and later the disturbance-recovery hypothesis) argues that grazing pressure is the leading order control on bloom timing (Behrenfeld 2010;Behrenfeld et al. 2013), and allows a bloom to start before stratification is established. Behrenfeld (2010) argues that within a deep winter mixed layer, replete with nutrients, phytoplankton cell density and predator-prey encounter rates are reduced, stimulating an increase in phytoplankton biomass prior to the onset of stratification. As the surface mixed layer develops in early spring, phytoplankton and the grazer populations become concentrated into a thin surface layer, which increases encounter rates and eventually limits bloom biomass.Existing studies have therefore identified key mechanisms controlling bloom initiation, and these processes are also important for understanding the subsequent development and dynamics of a bloom. However, many studies are based on open ocean data and/or coarse spatial ($ 10s km) and temporal ($ week) scale climatologies and satellite imagery (Henson et al. 2009;Behrenfeld 2010;Brody and Lozier 2014). These coarse time-and basin-scale approaches are generally unable to resolve short-lived (sub-daily) changes in wind stress, wave climate, incidental irradiance or diurnal cycles of heating and cooling that all impose a significant adjustment to stratification, turbulent mixing and light availability during a bloom. Furthermore, they do not consider the role of tidal mixing, an important forcing in shelf sea environments.",False,False,False,
1039,10.1002/lno.11734,5,True,"Like the open ocean, in shelf seas sub-daily changes in meteorological forcing impose significant adjustments to the length of the growing season and have implications that cascade to other functions of the ecosystem (Powley et al. 2020). However, the relatively shallow bathymetry of shelf seas and their proximity to land means that they are biologically and dynamically different to the open ocean. The penetration of light can be strongly attenuated by particulate and dissolved matter that is re-suspended from the seabed, or originates from rivers (Babin et al. 2003). Tidal currents drive strong vertical mixing, such that the seasonal pycnocline is established once the rate of stabilizing heat input is able to overcome the de-stabilizing effect of wind and tidally-generated turbulent mixing (Simpson and Bowers 1981). The seasonal pycnocline is therefore always established from the sea surface downward, above the critical depth. Further, the maximum winter mixing length scale is constrained by the bathymetry, which limits the likelihood of phytoplankton and their grazers becoming sufficiently decoupled to allow seasonal cycles of dilutionrecoupling as may occur in the open ocean.",False,False,False,

Seasonal stratification at our study site started to build on the 26th March 2015 coincident with the beginning of sustained positive heat flux (Ruiz-Castillo et al. 2019a). Surface chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations also started to increase above background winter levels on this day. The observations presented here start 10 d later, providing detailed information on the evolution of the bloom over the 2-weeks leading up to its peak. These 2-weeks accounted for 90% of the observed increase in surface Chl a concentration between bloom initiation and the biomass maximum. We demonstrate the critical role that the strength and structure of turbulent mixing from winds, nighttime convection and tidally generated shear played in governing the development of the bloom, via controlling exposure of phytoplankton cells to light. Uniquely, we have coincident measurements of all the key physical variables that underpin phytoplankton growth rates: temperature, irradiance, stratification, mixed layer depth, vertical turbulent structure, and active mixing layer depths. Unlike previous studies that have relied on parameterizations and length scales to estimate the depth of active mixing, we employ sub-hourly profiles of the observed turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate. The conclusions we draw are widely applicable to any shelf or open ocean region where wind-driven mixing has the ability to modify nutrient and light availability, especially across subpolar shelves in the northern hemisphere where light rather than nutrients is typically the limiting factor on phytoplankton growth.",False,False,False,
1041,10.1002/lno.11734,7,True,"## Methods
## Study site
Our observations are from a central location in the Celtic Sea (Fig. 1a) on the Northwest European Shelf. The Central Celtic Sea study site was 120 km from the shelf edge and 200 km from the nearest coast or tidal mixing front. The total water depth was 145 m. Dynamics in the Central Celtic Sea are typical of a seasonally stratifying temperate shelf with vertical ocean-atmosphere heat fluxes principally controlling the development and breakdown of seasonal stratification (Simpson and Bowers 1981;Wihsgott et al. 2019).## Gliders
Two gliders were deployed and maintained a position in close proximity to a mooring array in the Central Celtic Sea for 21 d between the 4th and 25th April 2015 (Fig. 1a). The gliders remained within 10 km of the moorings and of each other throughout the deployment, which is within one tidal excursion and so considered quasi-stationary for the purposes of this study (Fig. 1b). Each glider was equipped with the following sensors:
1. A Teledyne Slocum glider carrying a SeaBird CTD and a Rockland Scientific Microrider ocean microstructure package, providing coincident measurements of the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy (ϵ). A total of 1642 profiles were completed, averaging one profile every 16 min. Data were processed following Palmer et al. (2015) to obtain coincident profiles of temperature, salinity and ϵ from near-surface (typically with 5 m) to 110 m depth at approximately 1 m vertical resolution. 2. An iRobot Seaglider carrying a SeaBird CT sensor, Paine pressure sensor and Wetlabs ECO-puck for Chl a fluorescence (470/695 nm) completed 1547 profiles, providing information on vertical water column density structure and Chl a fluorescence on average every 19 min.Thermal lag corrections were applied following the methods of Garau et al. (2011). Glider temperature, salinity and fluorescence were calibrated against CTD casts from a coincident ship-based survey (see CTD profiles and nutrient sampling section) and each profile interpolated onto a 1 m resolution grid. Corrections were applied to minimize the impact of fluorescence quenching (see Data S1).",False,False,False,
1042,10.1002/lno.11734,8,True,"## Moorings and surface forcing
Wind speed and direction, air temperature, relative humidity, air pressure, sea surface temperature, salinity, Chl a fluorescence and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm) were measured from a mooring at the Central Celtic Sea study site. Full water column currents were provided by an upward looking 150 kHz Flowquest acoustic current profiler mounted in a bed frame.Wind stress, τ = C d ρ a W 2 , was calculated where W is the wind speed (m s -1 ) at 10 m above the sea surface, ρ a the air density (1.22 kg m -3 ), and C d the drag coefficient. The bottom tidal stress, τ b = k b ρ 0 û j jû , was calculated where û is the depth mean tidal current velocity (m s -1 ), k b a drag coefficient (0.0025) and ρ 0 (kg m -3 ) the near bed density.Neglecting any changes in salinity, the net surface heat flux (Q net ; W m -2 ), was obtained by subtraction of the longwave back radiation, sensible and latent heat fluxes from the net shortwave radiation entering the ocean. The sensible and latent heat fluxes were calculated following Fairall et al. (1996). The net longwave and net shortwave radiation were taken four-times a day from the National Center for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis product (Kalnay et al. 1996). Time series were extracted from the grid point covering the Central Celtic Sea mooring location. The heat flux is defined to be positive when the ocean is gaining heat from the atmosphere.",False,False,False,

Between 3rd and 28th April, 42 full depth CTD casts were taken within 10 km of the Central Celtic Sea mooring array (Fig. 1b). A SeaBird 911plus CTD recorded temperature, conductivity, and pressure. Derived salinity was calibrated against in situ samples analyzed on a Guildline 8400B autosal. Chl a fluorescence was recorded by a Chelsea Technology Group Aquatracka MKIII and calibrated against > 200 samples of extracted Chl a, including 24 deep (> 60 m) samples from beneath the seasonal pycnocline on the shelf (see Fig. S1). A Biospherical QCP Cosine PAR sensor measured down-welling surface irradiance. Water samples for the determination of Chl a and nutrient concentrations (including nitrate + nitrite) were collected on each CTD cast. Chl a samples were collected from six depths and fluorescence was measured on a Turner Design Trilogy fluorometer using a nonacidification module and calibrated against a solid standard and a pure Chl a standard (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) (see details in Mayers et al. 2019). Nutrient samples were analyzed onboard using a Bran and Luebbe segmented flow colorimetric auto-analyzer using techniques described in Woodward and Rees (2001).",False,False,False,
1044,10.1002/lno.11734,10,True,"## Seasonal pycnocline and mixing layer definitions
We define the base of the active mixing layer (z mix ), as the depth at which ϵ approached background values, chosen here as ϵ = 1 × 10 -8.5 W kg -1 . This fixed threshold is midway between the two values used by Sutherland et al. (2014) and indicative of a region that, from 9th April onwards, consistently separated upper and mid-water turbulent processes. Between the 5th and 9th April this fixed dissipation threshold was less reliable, a recognized problem when the water column is experiencing diurnal stratification, nighttime convection and wind-driven mixing (see e.g., Sutherland et al. 2014).During this spring transition period we were unable to reliably identify the seasonal pycnocline by assessing changes in density from a near surface reference. The commonly used threshold of 0.125 kg m -3 (de Boyer Montegut et al. 2004;Henson et al. 2009;Chiswell 2011) was too high and only correctly identified the seasonal pycnocline on the 21st April, clearly after the observed change in vertical structure and after the main peak in phytoplankton biomass. We therefore define the base of the seasonal pycnocline (z pyc ) as the depth at which the density decreased by 0.015 kg m -3 below the bottom density. This is comparable to the value of 0.02 kg m -3 used by Hickman et al. (2012) in nearby waters and is aligned with the deepest local maxima in buoyancy frequency.The buoyancy frequency, N 2 = -g ρ 0 dρ dz , was calculated as a measure of the strength of stratification and the depths of multiple mixed layers. Here, g = 9.81 m s -2 is acceleration due to gravity, dρ dz is the vertical potential density gradient and ρ 0 the average density. We also calculate the potential energy anomaly,
Þ gz dz (J m -3 ), between the sea surface and depth of the pycnocline (z pyc ), where ρ is the mean potential density of the water column. Φ is a measure of the work required to bring about complete vertical mixing. It is zero for a fully mixed water column and increases as stratification strengthens.",False,False,False,
1045,10.1002/lno.11734,11,True,"## Light attenuation and euphotic zone depth
The vertical light attenuation coefficient of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), K d , was estimated from 42 PAR profiles taken within 10 km of the Central Celtic Sea site (Fig. 1b). K d was estimated from the slope of a linear fit through log(PAR) vs. depth within the surface mixed layer. The depth of the surface mixed layer was defined according to a density threshold of Δσ θ = 0.025 kg m -3 . Where there was strong vertical variability in Chl a and PAR with depth and/or high near surface Chl a, the fit was performed on the nearsurface portion of the data only, avoiding the top 5-10 m where light data were unreliable. A significant linear relationship (r 2 = 0.78, p < 0.01, n = 35) was established between log (K d ) and log(chl sml ) where chl sml is the mean Chl a concentration within the surface mixed layer. Based on this relationship, for each glider profile we calculated the depth of the euphotic zone (z eu ), defined as the 1% irradiance level, from a measure of the mean Chl a concentration within the surface mixed layer.## The phytoplankton growth model
To help diagnose how and why phytoplankton biomass accumulation and carbon production rates were changing during the glider deployment we setup a coupled 1-D Lagrangian random walk and phytoplankton growth model. The model moves particles around a 1-D water column. The trajectories of the particles are determined by the vertical eddy diffusivity values that we derived from the observed dissipation profiles. The phytoplankton cells ""contained"" within each of the particles photosynthesize and respire according to the availability of light and nutrients. The model uses fixed grazing and cell mortality rates, a simplicity that allows the physical controls of turbulence and light to be isolated. In this section we describe the setup and forcing of the model and justify our parameter choices.",False,False,False,
1046,10.1002/lno.11734,12,True,"## Lagrangian random walk
A Lagrangian random walk model, appropriate for a spatially nonuniform turbulent mixing environment with sharp vertical gradients in diffusivity (Visser 1997;Ross and Sharples 2004), was used to track 10,000 model particles through a vertical eddy diffusivity field estimated from the dissipation values measured by the glider. Each new particle position z n + 1 was calculated from its current position z n based on the following random walk:
where K z (m 2 s -1 ) is the vertical turbulent eddy diffusivity and K 0 z = dKz = dz (m s -1 ) its derivative. Δt is the model time step (1 s) and R a random process of zero mean and variance v.The vertical eddy diffusivities,
were calculated assuming a mixing efficiency of κ = 0.2. Dissipation (ϵ) and buoyancy frequency (N 2 ) were taken from the glider profiles. The Slocum glider did not always collect reliable microstructure data within the top 5-10 m of the water column. In these instances, to achieve a realistic logarithmic decay of K z near the surface, near-surface dissipation was estimated using
, where w * is the friction velocity derived from 10 m wind speeds (W 10 ) using the relation
10 , and the von Karman constant, κ = 0.41. Wind stress was the dominant control on the mixing length scale, so this approach was considered acceptable.",False,False,False,

To avoid artificial particle accumulation, a piecewise cubic smoothing spine with 17 breakpoints was fitted to these averaged and filtered profiles of log 10 (K z ) to ensure that both the first and second derivatives of K z were smooth and continuous. An example is shown in Fig. 2a. To avoid particles accumulating at the boundaries the first derivative of K z was forced to zero at the surface and seabed by applying the spline to the original profile and its extensions, such that the profile was symmetric about the boundaries (Ross and Sharples 2004). Averaging the number of particles in each depth bin across the whole 24-d simulation, we find that the maximum deviation from the original uniform particle distribution is < 1.5% within 5 m of the surface and bottom, and < 5% within the euphotic zone (31 m).",False,False,False,

The light exposure of phytoplankton cells is affected on hourly to daily time-scales by: (1) day-night, (2) cloud cover, and (3) vertical mixing. Each day a phytoplankton cell may experience both extreme light and fully dark conditions. It will continually try to acclimate (adapt) to its ambient light conditions to achieve optimal growth rates (Marra 1978;MacIntyre et al. 2000). A cells photosynthetic performance is therefore dependent upon its previous light history and its physiological state. We adapted the phytoplankton-growth model used by Ross and Sharples (2008) which was based on the production-acclimation model of Denman and Marra (1986) to simulate the instantaneous production of a cell being moved through a vertical light gradient.Typically, photosynthesis-irradiance (P-I) curves are used to determine the average rate of photosynthetic carbon production at varying levels of light intensity (Jassby and Platt 1976;MacIntyre et al. 2002). The light intensity at which the photosynthesis of a cell starts approaching its maximum value is called the saturation onset. At higher light intensities, the rate of carbon fixation levels out, or even decreases, as the high light damages the phytoplankton photosystem. This is known as photo-inhibition and starts once light levels exceed the inhibition onset. Photo-acclimation of a cell to continually varying light levels throughout the day however means that the instantaneous rate of carbon production cannot be described by a single P-I curve (Denman and Marra 1986).",False,False,False,
1049,10.1002/lno.11734,15,True,"Within the model, we describe a cell that has adapted to achieve optimal growth rates under high light levels as fully ""light acclimated."" In contrast, a cell adapted to achieve maximum growth rates under extreme light limitation (very low light availability) is said to be ""dark acclimated."" Changes in the photosynthetic carbon production rate of a cell that is fully dark acclimated (P d ) or fully light acclimated (P l ) is described by two different curves:
where P d=l m is the maximum dark or light-acclimated production, I d/l is the saturation onset for the dark or light-acclimated curve, and I is the light intensity at the particle depth. The instantaneous production, P, of a cell continually adapting to varying light levels, always falls between these two limiting curves, and depends on the acclimation status of the cell, i.e., its degree of adaption from the dark to the light acclimated curve. As a cell moves through light gradients its cellular acclimation status, Y, changes according to:
where γ is the acclimation timescale (1 h) and Δt the model time step (1 s). Y reflects the light history of the cell that is always moving towards the acclimation status appropriate for the ambient irradiance level, described by the exponential function X(I) (see Denman and Marra (1986) for full details). The instantaneous light-dependent production (photosynthetic rate, P; d -1 ), is then calculated from:
When the cell is fully adapted to a high light environment (Y = 1), the production rate is P l . If the cell has been in darkness for a sustained period the cellular acclimation status will be zero (Y = 0) and the production rate is P d . This photoacclimation model reproduces the observed hysteresis in photosynthetic rates over a day: high rates in the morning, a midday depression and values recovering in the afternoon but lower than at the same irradiances experienced in the morning (Marra 1978).",False,False,False,

The model absorption coefficient is the sum of a background light absorption (0.09 m -1 ) and the contribution from self-shading, a depth dependent variable determined by the carbon biomass of cells in the water column above and their cell-specific absorption coefficient (see Ross 2004). Accurate replication of the light field is therefore dependent upon growth within the model, which is itself a function of light availability.The model takes into account one key limiting nutrient, appropriate for the Celtic Sea (Holligan et al. 1984), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN). The model cells take up DIN, at concentration N (mg m -3 ), store it up to a maximum nutrientcarbon ratio, and consume it during photosynthesis. The uptake of nutrients, U, follows:
where Q is the cellular nutrient-to-carbon ratio which needs to remain above a subsidence quota (Q min ) and below a maximum storage quota (Q max ). U m is the maximum uptake rate and κ N the half-saturation constant. The cells take up as much nutrient as possible based on the nutrient concentration available in the water column and their cellular nutrient-to-carbon ratio.

where r is the cellular respiration rate (d -1 ), G is the grazing rate (d -1 ), C is the cellular carbon (mg C) and P is the instantaneous photosynthetic production rate (d -1 ). The model contains a lower carbon threshold (C starve ) at which cells begin to die and an upper level (C divide ) at which the cells divide (so the number of cells per Lagrangian particle doubles).

To test this simplification, we ran sensitivity experiments with a range of fixed grazing rates. We also allowed for a linear six-fold increase as the bloom developed, equivalent to the increase in micro-zooplankton grazing pressure reported by Mayers et al.

The values assigned to each model parameter (see Table 1) were guided by similar model setups for temperate shelf sea environments including the Celtic Sea (Ross and Sharples 2008;Sharples 2008;Marsh et al. 2015). Maximum dark and light acclimated production (P d=l m ), the dark and light saturation onset (I d/l ) and the inhibition onset (I b ) were chosen based on the results of 14 C-uptake photosynthesis-irradiance experiments in the Celtic Sea (Hickman et al. 2012) and previous successful implementations of the model (Ross and Sharples 2008). The maximum production rate, P d m = 1.6 d -1 , lies comfortably within the range of carbon specific photosynthesis rates (0.27-3.83 d -1 ) reported in a review by MacIntyre et al. (2002).Small flagellates (2-20 μm) as opposed to larger diatoms (> 20 μm) dominated the 2015 spring bloom in the Celtic Sea in terms of both Chl a and primary production (Poulton & Hickman, unpubl.). Although there was some succession within the flagellate groups present (cryptophytes and other nano-eukaryotic taxa; G. Tarran pers. comm.) as the bloom evolved, nano-eukaryotes remained the dominant group in terms of carbon biomass throughout April (Poulton & Tarran, unpubl.).

There is no consensus in the literature on the quantitative definition of a bloom, which leads to differing conclusions on when, where and why a bloom occurs (Brody et al. 2013). Here, following Behrenfeld and Boss (2018), we consider the specific rate of change of biomass and calculate it within the actively mixing surface layer. Increases and decreases in phytoplankton biomass result from the imbalance between carbon production (i.e., the growth rate, μ; d -1 ) and loss (l; d -1 ) rates. This imbalance can be expressed by the specific rate of change of biomass, or accumulation rate (a; d -1 ):
where a is normalized to C phyto (mg C m -3 ), the depth average biomass between the sea surface and z mix . Carbon production (μ) is defined as the difference between a cells photosynthetic (P; d -1 ) and respiration rates (r; d -1 ). When light and nutrient availability support photosynthetic production that exceeds cell respiration (P > r) carbon is produced, and μ is positive. For phytoplankton biomass to increase (a > 0), and a phytoplankton population to be considered ""blooming,"" μ must exceed l.",False,False,False,
1055,10.1002/lno.11734,21,True,"Correctly determining the balance between μ and l requires an appreciation of how the accumulation rate in a depth varying actively mixing layer, within which phytoplankton are uniformly distributed, is not always accurately represented by the rate of change of C phyto . In a deepening mixing layer for example, dilution of a phytoplankton population may be equal to or greater than the excess in μ over l. In this situation, the carbon biomass (in mg C m -3 ), may remain constant or even decrease, despite production rates exceeding losses. However, the depth-integrated carbon (ΣC phyto ) increases during the deepening and it is the specific rate of change of ΣC phyto that should be used to identify the balance between μ and l. The inverse of this situation can also occur: as the actively mixing layer shoals, an increase in light availability may stimulate an increase in μ over l and an increase in biomass (a > 0). However, the depth-integrated biomass (ΣC phyto ) of the population blooming in the much shallower mixing layer is not necessarily greater than ΣC phyto in the previously deeper layer.We therefore quantify the specific accumulation rate within the active mixing layer (a zmix ; d -1 ) from the rate of change of depth averaged C phyto (normalized by C phyto ) when the active mixing layer is constant or shoaling, and from normalized changes in ΣC phyto when z mix is deepening. Specifically,
These definitions help us to understand the conditions under which phytoplankton biomass above z mix changes. We have calculated C phyto and ΣC phyto for the model (in mg C m -3 and mg C m -2 ) and Chl phyto and ΣChl phyto (in mg Chl m -3 and mg Chl m -2 ) for the observations.From the model we also calculate the specific carbon production rate within the active mixing layer (μ zmix ; d -1 ).

## Wind stress and tidal forcing
Over the deployment period, wind speeds varied between 2 and 13 m s -1 equivalent to a 0.4 N m -2 range in surface wind stress (Fig. 3a). Between the 4th and 9th April the wind stress remained relatively stable, fluctuating around 0.1 N m -2 , with subsequent peaks occurring on the 11th, 12th, 16th, 18th, 19th, 21st, and 22nd April separating otherwise low stress levels. Episodes of weak wind stress (< 0.05 N m -2 ), equivalent to wind speeds < 5 m s -1 , lasting more than 24 h, occurred between 9th and 10th April and between 13 and 15 th April. There were also shorter episodes of low wind stress on the 17th, 20th, and 23rd April.Spring tides occurred on the 6th and 20th April (Fig. 3a) when tidal bed stress peaked at 0.75 and 1 N m -2 , respectively. There was a marked asymmetry between the two spring periods with the second spring tide being the stronger of the two. Only one neap tide was observed, occurring on the 13th April however, the final stages of the study observed relatively low tidal flows, close to a second neap period. On sub-daily time scales, the bottom tidal stress was dominated by quarterdiurnal (flood-ebb) variability.",False,False,False,

Similarly, a cloudy day on the 23rd April interrupted four consecutive clear sky days and was followed by strong incident radiation on the 24th and 25th April.

1058,10.1002/lno.11734,24,True,"## Heat flux and stratification
There was a diurnal cycle of the ocean gaining heat during the day and then loosing heat to the atmosphere during the night, indicated by alternating positive and negative surface heat flux respectively (Fig. 3c). The average daily surface heat flux between the 4th and 25th April was 89 W m -2 , representing a net heat flux into the ocean throughout the deployment period. This resulted in a gradual increase in near surface temperature from 10 C on 5th April to over 11 C on the 25th (Fig. 4a). The surface (1-5 m average) to bottom (105-110 m average) difference in potential density subsequently increased from 0.05 to 0.20 kg m -3 during this time. For wider seasonal context, at the peak of stratification in August 2014 the top-bottom density difference at the Central Celtic Sea was > 2.00 kg m -3 (Wihsgott et al. 2019).Throughout the deployment period, increases in nearsurface temperature were observed to coincide with short (hourly to 1-2 d) episodes of reduced wind stress (notably on the 9th-10th and 13th-14th April) that allowed shallow, warm surface layers to form over the upper 10-20 m (Fig. 4a). These shallow, thin layers were subsequently eroded by the following input of increased wind stress (or by nighttime convection), and the heat retained within the near surface then re-distributed down to the base of the seasonal pycnocline. This cycle of surface warming followed by mixing of the upper ocean, increasing and then lowering the potential energy anomaly between the sea surface and z pyc , respectively (Fig. 4c), resulted in an increasing strength of stratification over the whole water column and at the main pycnocline, where the buoyancy frequency (N 2 ) gradually increased throughout April, from < 1 × 10 -5 to > 2 × 10 -4 s -2 (Fig. 4b).",False,False,False,

Throughout the deployment, the depth of the active surface mixing layer (z mix ) varied between 5 and 56 m (Fig. 4e) and was observed to deepen every night relative to the preceding day. For example, in the early hours of the morning on 6th April z mix reached a depth of 56 m, then shoaled during the day to 18 m depth as a warm surface layer developed. Between the 5th and 9th of April, the potential energy anomaly (Fig. 4c) conclusively shows that the water column between the surface and z pyc became fully mixed each night. However this is not always mirrored by z mix reaching the pycnocline (Fig. 4e), a consequence of the fixed dissipation threshold not always reliably identifying the full depth of active mixing taking place within the surface waters during this period.From the 9th April onwards the most pronounced deepening (shoaling) events were associated with increases (decreases) in wind stress. The linear correlation coefficient between wind stress and z mix from the 9th April onwards was 0.60 (p < 0.01, n = 1188). Prior to the 9th April, the correlation coefficient was 0.2 (p < 0.01, n = 359). Furthermore, the turbulent Langmuir number, La = (v * /U s ) 1/2 (Belcher et al. 2012), a measure of the relative influences of directly wind-driven shear (with friction velocity v * ) and wave-driven stokes drift (U s ) was > 0.3 for 55% of the deployment (> 0.2 for 98% of the time).

During this period, ε < 1 × 10 -9 W kg -1 was observed throughout the region immediately beneath the surface constrained active mixing layer and was only observed to increase towards the base of the seasonal pycnocline, z pyc . The previously identified period of reduced wind stress, starting on the 13th April, left behind remnant mixed layers, which were characterized by only weak levels of vertical mixing. Dissipation beneath z pyc was dominated by tidally driven quarter-to semi-diurnal and fortnightly spring-neap variability (Fig. 4e) attributable to tidally induced bed shear stress. During spring tides, the turbulent bottom boundary layer extended to the base of the pycnocline.

Therefore, during the night new biomass was being redistributed down to the seasonal pycnocline by convective mixing, homogenizing the Chl a concentration. From the 9th April onwards the average Chl a biomass within the active mixing layer and above the seasonal pycnocline diverged, reflecting the decoupling between the active mixing layer and seasonal pycnocline, and a bias towards a higher relative biomass accumulation above z mix (Fig. 5a,c).",False,False,False,

This is well reproduced by the model which predicts that DIN within the active mixing layer was fully depleted by the end of the 17 th April (Fig. 7; red squares).

## Nighttime convection and wind-mixing regimes
Our glider observations and model results have revealed important aspects of the drivers, timing, magnitude and rates of phytoplankton growth on a temperate continental shelf during the spring. We identify two distinct regimes that followed the initial onset of stratification and initiation of the bloom (Fig. 10). During the first, a diurnal cycle of near surface growth followed by nighttime convective mixing dominated. During the second, the largest and most rapid changes in phytoplankton biomass took place within the wind-driven active mixing layer.From previous work, we know that positive heat input initiated seasonal stratification on 26 th March but, vertical differences in salinity (not temperature) controlled 50%-100% of water column stability between the 28th March and 7th April (Ruiz-Castillo et al. 2019a). Our gliders were deployed during this time (on 4th April) and we initially observe (and model) modest increases in phytoplankton biomass within the nutrient replete euphotic zone during the day, followed by redistribution of this biomass to the depth of the pycnocline by convective overturning at night (Fig. 10a).",False,False,False,

The increased importance of wind-driven mixing is consistent with the increase in correlation between z mix and wind stress that we find here, from 0.2 during the 5 d before the 9th April to 0.6 for the remainder of the deployment. On the 9th April, reduced wind stress allowed the warm near surface cap established during the day to be maintained throughout the night, decoupling the active mixing layer from the seasonal pycnocline by more than 30 m. Henceforth periods of low wind stress resulted in shoaling of the active mixing layer and stimulated rapid increases in biomass that were retained within it (Fig. 10b). The model confirms that maximum carbon production and biomass accumulation rates occurred after periods of reduced wind stress and shoaling of z mix , which drove changes in light availability to the phytoplankton cells. plankton growth within the sunlit surface waters during the day. At night convective mixing evenly redistributes new biomass to the seasonal pycnocline (z pyc ). Nutrient availability does not limit phytoplankton growth. (b) Wind-driven mixing. The active mixing layer (z mix ) and the seasonal pycnocline (z pyc ) are decoupled. Wind stress is the dominant control on the depth of active mixing. Phytoplankton growth rates and biomass accumulation above z mix increase when the wind stress is weak and the active mixing layer shoals. Initially, when nutrients are replete, light availability mediated by changes in the depth of active mixing dominates phytoplankton dynamics (10th-17th April, 2a). Once nutrients have been depleted within the active mixing layer, both light and nutrient availability are important controls on growth (18th-25th April, 2b).",False,False,False,

The wind-mixing regime could further be separated into (a) a nutrient replete condition where light availability and photoacclimation dominated the phytoplankton dynamics, and (b) when nutrients began to deplete and nutrient resupply from beneath the pycnocline also became important.Although we identify two distinct periods of time in our data set where the dominant drivers of vertical mixing were different, the evolution of the spring bloom in temperate seas progresses differently each year owing to interannual and spatial variability in, for example, wind and tidal forcing, insolation and water column stability. Not every year will exactly mirror the progression between the regimes described here in 2015, but in situations where light rather than nutrients is the limiting factor for phytoplankton growth, convective and/or wind-driven mixing are likely to be of leading order importance during the spring bloom period.We now consider further details behind these key findings, specifically; the importance of distinguishing between the depth of active mixing and the pycnocline, the role of variable cloud clover and photo acclimation, the balance between physical and biological controls on phytoplankton growth, the impact of wind and tidally driven advection, and the role of the barotropic tide in entraining biomass into bottom water, a process unique to shelf sea environments.",False,False,False,

The base of the active mixing layer and the seasonal pycnocline was decoupled during most of our study period, separated by a region of low turbulent kinetic energy dissipation and vertical eddy diffusivities (Fig. 4e). We did not see any significant biomass increases within this weak mixing layer (Fig. 5a), even though z pyc was close to or shallower than estimates of Sverdrup's critical depth ($ 50 m; Wihsgott et al. 2019) and surface waters were not depleted in nutrients (Fig. 7). Although daily depth average light between the sea surface and z pyc varied from 12 to 60 μE m -2 s -1 , phytoplankton cells were not being thoroughly mixed over the whole light gradient. Those trapped between z mix and z pyc received an average daily light dose of only 0.15-17 μE m -2 s -1 , much less than those retained within the active mixing layer (Fig. 11a). The daily carbon production rate of cells between z mix and z pyc was less than zero (except on the 9th and 13th) (Fig. 9c). Therefore, even though there were sufficient nutrients to support growth, cells remained light-limited beneath z mix . Light-limitation was only fully relieved within the nearsurface mixing layers that kept cells shallower in the euphotic zone and above z eu (Fig. 5a). On the 9th and 13-14th April the average biomass between z mix and z pyc was at its highest (2.5 mg Chl m -3 ). At these times of minimum wind stress, z mix was very shallow and sat 20 m above z eu (Fig. 5a). Growth was therefore possible in a 10-20 m layer below z mix , which is reflected in the positive daily production rates between z mix and z pyc on these dates (Fig. 9c).",False,False,False,

In addition to the close coupling between z mix , carbon production rates and changes in phytoplankton biomass accumulation (Fig. 9d,e), we observed the maximum midday irradiance to vary by a factor of three and the average light available to cells within the surface mixing layer to vary by a factor of 13. Furthermore, based on a significant log(K d -Chl) relationship established using PAR and Chl a fluorescence profiles at the Central Celtic Sea, we know that K d varied by a factor of three due to changes in in situ biomass and the effect of (chlorophyll) self-shading.Our results suggest that the exact timing and magnitude of increases in production and accumulation rates following shoaling of z mix was moderated by day-to-day variability in cloud cover. For example, rather than observing significant increases in production rates and biomass accumulation on the 9th and 13th, when z mix shoaled and incident radiation was high, maximum daily carbon production actually occurred on the 10th and 14th April, two of the cloudiest days (Fig. 9a,c). In the early hours of the morning on the 9th April, one of the sunniest days observed (> 1000 μE m -2 s -1 at midday), z mix shoaled from 29 to 8 m depth. Rather than increase, the daily average carbon production on the 9 th remained constant at 0.15 d -1 (Fig. 9c). Production increased to over 0.23 d -1 the next day (10th April). The active mixing layer remained above 15 m until late afternoon on the 10th, but there was an increase in cloud cover that reduced the maximum midday irradiance to < 500 μE m -2 s -1 and therefore also the daily light dose received by cells in the active mixing layer (Figs. 9a,11a). A similar sequence of events took place between the 13th and 14th April. This implies that variability in cloud cover can make a significant difference to the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms by moderating the daily light dose.",False,False,False,
1078,10.1002/lno.11734,44,True,"To more clearly separate the effect of variable cloud cover from changes in z mix , we ran the model with two different fixed levels of maximum midday irradiance, representative of the brightest (1330 μE m -2 s -1 ) and cloudiest days (416 μE m -2 s -1 ). All other variables, including the vertical eddy diffusivities driving the particle trajectories, were kept the same. The average (and total) light dose experienced by cells within the active mixing layer over each day, for fixed values of midday irradiance, is shown in Fig. 11a. In these runs the day-to-day variability in light exposure was driven only by changes in the depth of z mix . Figure 11b shows modeled daily carbon production rates for the observed light field (as in Fig. 9c) and for the synthetic light time series. Figure 11c shows the specific biomass accumulation rate anomalies (observed minus synthetic). The acclimation status of cells with the active mixing layer is shown in Fig. 11d.Carbon production on the 9th April when the maximum observed daily irradiance reached 1105 μE m -2 s -1 (Fig. 9a) did not increase as the mixing layer shoaled because (1) in the high light levels phytoplankton cell acclimation status was high (Y = 0.8 at midday) (Fig. 11d), reducing the maximum possible instantaneous production rates and (2) the average light experienced by the cells was close to the inhibition threshold of 200 μE m -2 s -1 (Fig. 11a), indicating that they may have become photo-inhibited. If the 9th April had instead been a cloudy day, then the daily production rate would have increased to 0.3 d -1 (yellow line in Fig. 11b), and the biomass accumulation rate would have been greater (Fig. 11c). Conversely, if there had been slightly more light then the average light exposure would have exceeded the inhibition threshold (Fig. 11a), cells would have been photoinhibited and carbon production rates would have decreased (red line in Fig. 11b), in spite of the shoaling event.",False,False,False,
1079,10.1002/lno.11734,45,True,"On the 13th and 14th April the depth of the active mixing layer remained above 10 m. The maximum midday irradiance however decreased from 1300 μE m -2 s -1 on the 13th to 600 μE m -2 s -1 on the 14th (Fig. 9a). This reduced the average daily light availability above z mix from close to the inhibition threshold (200 μE m -2 s -1 ), to 100 μE m -2 s -1 (blue line in Fig. 11a) which is much closer to the light levels required for cells to achieve their maximum photosynthetic performance (the saturation onset of 90 μE m -2 s -1 ). If the 13th had been cloudy, then carbon production rates and biomass accumulation would have increased instead (yellow lines in Fig. 11b,c). Conversely, if light levels had remained high on the 14th then carbon production would not have increased and biomass accumulation would have reduced.Variability in production rates associated with day-to-day variability in cloud cover can affect the timing and magnitude of the biomass peak. The observed and modeled (using the observed light levels) biomass peak within the active mixing layer occurred during the afternoon of the 17th April (11 and 189 mg C m -3 , respectively). If each prior day had been sunny, then the biomass peak would still have occurred on the 17th, but it would have been 26% higher. In contrast, persistently cloudy days would have resulted in an equivalent peak in biomass (189 mg C m -3 ) but it would have occurred 3 d earlier, on the 14th April.",False,False,True,

An acclimation time-scale of 1 h (γ = 1 h) was chosen. It is reasonable to ask whether this representation of short-term acclimation was important. We address this question by running the model with a range of acclimation time scales: 1 s, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 h and 60 d. For γ = 1 s, the cell acclimates immediately at each model time step to its ambient light environment. For γ = 60 d, acclimation is effectively turned off, and the cells retain the acclimation status that they are initially prescribed (Y = 0 below 20 m, Y = 0.7 at the surface). When the acclimation time scale was 6 h or more, the model bloom occurred 3 d earlier than in our observations, and the surface water nutrient concentration decreased below 0.5 mg N m -3 more than 3 d too soon. For time scales of 3 h or less the model biomass peak occurred within a few hours of what we observed. We could not therefore have reproduced the timing of the 2015 spring bloom biomass peak in the Celtic Sea without an appropriate production-acclimation model and a suitable choice of photoacclimation time scale. Overall, we have shown that the effect of light on bloom dynamics is the result of complex feedbacks between active mixing depth, cloud cover, short-term photoacclimation, and in situ biomass.",False,False,False,
1081,10.1002/lno.11734,47,True,"## Physical vs. biological control
While we find physical processes to be the most important control on phytoplankton growth during the spring bloom, biological processes, particularly losses through predator-prey relationships, are also relevant when considering biomass accumulation rates and termination of phytoplankton blooms. Since the model was run with fixed respiration, grazing, and mortality rates (Table 1), differences between our observations and model are indicators of when biological rather than physical controls were more important in driving changes in biomass.The modeled and observed specific biomass accumulation rates (Fig. 9b) are different signs late in the day on the 18th April and then again from late afternoon on the 21st until the 23rd April. On both occasions the observed specific biomass accumulation rate is negative, indicating that loss rates exceeded phytoplankton growth at these times, whereas the model showed weakly positive rates. Divergence between the model and observations is also seen in Fig. 5d; the modeled depth integrated biomass within the active mixing layer between the 21st and 23rd April remains high whereas the observed biomass steadily decreases. These periods coincide with observed changes in the abundance, biomass, net growth and grazing rates of zooplankton at the Central Celtic Sea site during spring 2015 (Giering et al. 2019;Mayers et al. 2019), suggesting that at specific times grazing pressure exerted topdown control on the bloom. Between midday on the 21st and 22nd April a 20% reduction in depth integrated biomass within the active mixing layer was observed. A grazing rate of 0.2 d -1 , an order of magnitude larger than the fixed rate imposed in the model, would have been required at this time to achieve the equivalent 20% loss in model biomass. An order of magnitude increase in micro-zooplankton grazing rate throughout April was reported by Mayers et al. (2019) for the same bloom. Viral mortality, although not measured, may also have become more important following the peak of the bloom. Variable grazing and mortality rates are therefore reasonable explanations of the observation-model mismatches.",False,True,False,
1082,10.1002/lno.11734,48,True,"Despite the fixed rates of respiration, grazing and mortality and the imposed coupling between biomass and cell division, such convincing replication of the bloom leads us to conclude that variable grazing rates are not a first order control during the build-up of the spring bloom in shallow, temperate shelf seas.

1083,10.1002/lno.11734,49,True,"## Wind driven and tidal advection
The data presented here provides only a 1-D Eulerian perspective of phytoplankton growth. Therefore, it is reasonable to ask whether advective processes, moving patchy phytoplankton growth around, could contribute to the changes in Chl a biomass that we observed.Over timescales of days to months the wind sets up shelfscale circulations and is able to strain horizontal temperature and salinity gradients across the Celtic Sea (Ruiz-Castillo et al. 2019a, 2019b). During early spring, prevailing westerly winds frequently drive a surface layer of relatively cold and freshwater from the inner shelf southwards, and a compensatory northward return flow of warmer and more saline water at depth. This process plays an important role in delivering nutrients with an oceanic origin to the inner shelf (Ruiz-Castillo et al. 2019b) and in determining the onset of permanent seasonal stratification (Ruiz-Castillo et al. 2019a). The O (0.1 C) changes in bottom water temperature seen in Fig. 4a are consistent with wind driven advection. A wind driven surface current of 0.01 m s -1 , sustained over 1 month, could advect a parcel of water up to 30 km. Based on 4 km resolution ocean color satellite images, within a 30 km range of the Central Celtic Sea, the maximum horizontal Chl a gradient was 0.07 mg Chl m -3 km -1 . A 0.01 m s -1 current could therefore have introduced no more than a 2.5 × 10 -3 mg Chl m -3 h -1 change in Chl at a fixed sampling location. This is two orders of magnitude less than the mean rate of change of surface Chl a recorded by the glider (0.15 mg Chl m -3 h -1 ) and three orders of magnitude less than the maximum rate of increase (1.2 mg Chl m -3 h -1 ). Hence, wind driven surface circulation could not introduce significant variability into our timeseries of Chl a biomass.",False,False,False,
1084,10.1002/lno.11734,50,True,"The Celtic Sea has a strong semi-diurnal tide (Fig. 3a). This is reflected in the bottom water temperature (Fig. 4a) where a 5-10 km tidal excursion drove 0.025 C amplitude temperature oscillations. A 0.35 m s -1 tidal current advecting a 0.07 mg Chl m -3 km -1 gradient in surface Chl a past a fixed point could introduce increases and decrease in Chl a concentration of 0.1 mg Chl m -3 h -1 . In fact, we see this throughout the observational record. This known variability however is superimposed on top of much greater changes in surface Chl a that cannot be attributed to advection. On the 10th, 14th, and 17th April increases in surface Chl a concentration of 0.4, 1.2, and 1.2 mg Chl m -3 h -1 , respectively, were observed. Thus, during the periods of reduced wind stress and shoaling of z mix , when we observe (and model) increases in growth rate and the accumulation of biomass, tidal advection is not the leading order driver of the signal.The 1D model used in this study cannot account for advection. This is particularly noticeable after the biomass peak on the 17th April when there is a strong semi-diurnal signal in the observed depth integrated Chl a that is not replicated by the model (Fig. 5d). The strong spring tidal currents in combination with high levels of (presumably spatially patchy) biomass during this period would accentuate the mismatch. Importantly though, the model still captures the overall decrease in biomass within the active mixing layer between the 18th and 20th April, followed by an increase on the 21st April.",False,False,False,

Although the biomass specific accumulation rates between the 5th and 9th April were positive within the active mixing layer, including a local maximum on the 7th April, there was no local biomass maximum above either z mix or z pyc (Fig. 5c). Instead, the depth-integrated biomass above the pycnocline decreased from 88 mg Chl m -2 on 5th April to 78 mg Chl m -2 on the 8th April (not shown). So, if phytoplankton were blooming (actively growing) above z mix , where did the biomass accumulate? Between the 5th and 8th April, there was a 3 mg Chl m -2 increase in the total depth integrated biomass (from 118 to 121 mg Chl m -2 ), additional evidence that phytoplankton growth was occurring (Fig. 6a). Over the same period, the depth integrated Chl a below the pycnocline increased from 30 to 43 mg Chl m -2 , which is a 13 mg Chl m -2 increase and accounts for the 10 mg Chl m -2 lost from above the pycnocline, as well as the 3 mg Chl m -2 of extra (Chl a) biomass produced.",False,False,False,
1086,10.1002/lno.11734,52,True,"Figure 6b shows the percentage of the total water column integrated Chl a that was contained within the active mixing layer, above the pycnocline and in bottom waters.

On the 8th April, only 64% of the total biomass was above z pyc , while the remaining 36% was in the bottom water. The loss of biomass from above the pycnocline and the coincident increase in biomass below coincided with spring tides (Fig. 3a), a weak early season pycnocline (Fig. 4b) and tidally driven dissipation in the bottom boundary layer that extended to the base of the pycnocline (Fig. 4e). Figure 12a shows biomass being stripped from the base of the pycnocline and drawn into bottom water between the 5th and 9th April. Each erosion event happened just after peaks in the depth-integrated dissipation beneath the pycnocline (vertical dashed lines in Fig. 12). Since there was no light available to support new growth beneath the pycnocline, either within the bottom water or at the seabed, the source of high Chl a concentration (bottom layer depth average of 0.3-0.5 mg m -3 , see Fig. S2) must have been the surface water above.",False,False,False,
1087,10.1002/lno.11734,53,True,"Although dissipation during the second spring tide on 20th April was greater (Fig. 12b), comparatively little surface biomass was eroded. At this time, the strength of the pycnocline was an order of magnitude stronger (Fig. 4b), and most of the phytoplankton biomass was contained within the active mixing layer, 10 m or more above z pyc (Figs. 5a,6b). The decoupling of z mix and z pyc therefore prevented biomass within the active mixing layer from being eroded and entrained into the bottom water. Although very little biomass was stripped from the sunlit surface water at this time, the average Chl a concentration within the bottom layer remained relatively high (0.2 mg m -3 , see Fig. S2). This is because phytoplankton cells stripped from the surface layer between 5th and 9th April continued to fluoresce as they were homogenously mixed across the bottom layer by strong tidal currents (Figs. 3a, 4e).Tidally driven shear stress propagating upwards from the seabed and eroding biomass from subsurface phytoplankton populations has been observed before in shelf systems (Sharples et al. 2001), but never for such a prolonged period. It is a physical erosion process unique to shallow, tidally active shelves where the turbulent bottom boundary layer is able to extend to the base of the pycnocline. It is difficult to quantify what impact this event may have had on the timing and peak magnitude of the bloom, although given that seasonal stratification was established on 26th March, 4 days after maximum spring tides it is probable that the erosion event we observed here was the first of the season.",False,False,False,
1088,10.1002/lno.11734,54,True,"## Conclusions
We have presented observations and a model that show how the growth of phytoplankton and accumulation of biomass during the spring bloom period in a temperate shelf sea is tightly coupled to changes in the depth of the surface active mixing layer and day-to-day variability in cloud cover. During a 2-week period leading up to the blooms' biomass peak we observed two different mixing regimes. First, a diurnal regime of growth within the sunlit surface waters, followed by nighttime convection evenly redistributing new biomass to the base of the seasonal pycnocline (Fig. 10a). Then, a transition to a shallower wind-mixing regime where more rapid phytoplankton growth and biomass accumulation took place within the active mixing layer. Periods of reduced wind stress and shoaling of the active mixing layer stimulated peaks in growth rate and accumulation (Fig. 10b). Our results demonstrate that physical processes that mediate light availability are the leading order control on early spring phytoplankton growth. We also find that the ability of phytoplankton cells to acclimate to their light environment on hourly time scales to be an important control on the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton biomass peaks during the spring bloom. Lastly, we observed tidally-driven turbulence eroding phytoplankton biomass from the base of the seasonal pycnocline, entraining it into the bottom water, a process unique to shelf sea environments. These new insights into the significance of sub-daily changes in meteorological forcing, irradiance and turbulent mixing to bloom dynamics provide a detailed process level of understanding that has not been possible from coarser temporal and spatial resolution data sets. While it is inevitable that the spring bloom across temperate shelves evolves differently each year, it is likely that nighttime convection and wind-driven mixing will be of leading order importance.",False,False,False,
1089,10.1002/lno.11734,55,True,"Our key results are relevant across both continental shelves and the open ocean. Globally, day-to-day variability in local cloud cover is an order of magnitude greater than inter-annual variability (Stubenrauch et al. 2013). The sensitivity of phytoplankton growth rates and biomass accumulation to day-to-day changes in incidence irradiance is therefore highly relevant and important on global ocean scales, notably across cloudy polar and subpolar regions, and those in the path of storm tracks. Further, the passage of weather systems and storms drives hourly to daily changes in the depth of the active mixing layer across whole ocean basins. Under nutrient replete conditions (i.e., pre-bloom) the tight coupling between the depth of wind-driven mixing, light availability and biomass accumulation that we report here is highly important.Our findings present a number of challenges for coupled hydrodynamic-ecosystem models if we are to make accurate predictions of the timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms. Firstly, mixing parameterizations need to accurately resolve changes in the depth of surface mixing, on sub-daily time scales. This is particularly important when the water column is experiencing diurnal stratification, nighttime convection and episodes of wind-driven mixing. Secondly, ensuring that cloud cover and light attenuation are realistic and that phytoplankton have the ability to photo-acclimate on hourly timescales should be a priority.As a consequence of anthropogenic global warming, many of the physical drivers of phytoplankton bloom dynamics (e.g., heat fluxes, stratification, cloud cover, precipitation, and wind stress) are changing (IPCC 2013). The canonical view is that increasing stratification will reduce nutrient supply and thus reduce net primary production (Steinacher et al. 2010). Projected regional trends in net primary production across the NW European Shelf however are both positive and negative (Holt et al. 2016). Our results suggest that on a nutrient replete shelf, which fully mixes during the winter, changes in wind stress and local weather conditions (cloud cover) may have more influence over future changes in the timing, magnitude and duration of the spring phytoplankton bloom than the strength of the seasonal pycnocline.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Coastal sediments are major contributors to global carbon (C) mineralization and nutrient cycling and are tightly linked to processes in the pelagic environment. In this study, we aimed to investigate the regulating potential of quantity and quality of planktonic organic matter (OM) deposition on benthic metabolism, with a particular focus on nitrogen (N) cycling processes. We simulated inputs of spring (C : N 10.9) and summer (C : N 5.6) plankton communities in high and low quantities to sediment cores, and followed oxygen consumption, nutrient fluxes as well as nitrate reduction rates, that is, denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium for 10 d. Our results demonstrate the primary importance of OM quality in determining the fate of organic N once it settles to the sediment surface. Settling of N-rich summer plankton material resulted in a $ twofold lower denitrification efficiency (40-56%) compared to N-poor spring plankton (88-115%). This indicates that N-rich plankton deposition favors recycling of inorganic nutrients to the water column over N-loss via denitrification. OM quantity was positively related to mineralization activity, but this neither directly affected N fluxes nor denitrification activity, highlighting the complex interplay between the OM quantity and quality in regulating N cycling. In light of these new findings, we support the use of simple qualitative indicators such as C : N ratio of OM to investigate how future changes in benthic-pelagic coupling might influence N budgets at the sediment-water interface.",False,False,False,

Benthic and pelagic realms are tightly coupled in shallow seas, and unraveling the relationships between the two is paramount to fully understand element cycling in the marine environment (Griffiths et al. 2017). Perhaps the most important link between benthic and pelagic realms is the export of organic matter (OM) from surface waters to the seafloor. In many environments where the sediment is located below the photic zone, including shallow coastal areas such as the Baltic Sea, OM input from the water column constitutes the prime source of food and energy for benthic organisms (Tamelander et al. 2017). In temperate coastal seas, such inputs of OM to the benthos are controlled by seasonal cycles, with primary production typically exhibiting one, sometimes two, annual peak(s) (Winder and Cloern 2010). Often dominated by fastsinking diatoms, these peaks translate to important sedimentation events for the benthos (Tamelander et al. 2017). The rest of the year, phytoplankton production and settling to the seafloor are more limited due to environmental constraints (e.g., light and nutrient availability) or grazing pressure from zooplankton. During these periods, phytoplankton groups such as dinoflagellates or N-fixing cyanobacteria become in turn more prominent (Gustafsson et al. 2004;Winder and Cloern 2010). Zooplankton also exhibits strong seasonal patterns, mostly constrained by temperature and resource availability, and typically displays peak abundances in late spring and summer (Tamelander et al. 2017). The contribution of zooplankton to downward OM fluxes, aside from fecal pellets, is generally considered negligible (Turner 2002). However, some estimates suggest that zooplankton carcasses could contribute substantially to annual particulate organic carbon and nitrogen fluxes (36% and 34%, respectively; Sampei et al. 2009), thus providing a labile source of OM to the benthos. Overall, the quantity and quality of OM reaching soft sediments is highly variable and dynamic (Griffiths et al. 2017;Tamelander et al. 2017). How such variations may affect benthic biogeochemical cycles has yet to be resolved, and both parameters have high potential to regulate microbial activity.",False,False,False,
1105,10.1002/lno.11730,2,True,"Global estimates suggest that N is often a limiting factor for primary production in marine systems (Canfield et al. 2005;Deutsch et al. 2007). As such, the marine N cycle has received considerable attention in order to identify and quantify N sources and sinks in marine systems, as well as to identify potential factors regulating the processes involved (Voss et al. 2011). There is abundant literature on the impacts of OM sedimentation on benthic metabolism, highlighting the important structuring role of pelagic export on N cycling at the sediment-water interface (Griffiths et al. 2017 and references therein). Many processes central to the marine N cycle are carried out by microorganisms, and largely controlled by oxygen (O 2 ) conditions in the environment (Canfield et al. 2005). Consequently, the quantity of OM export to the seafloor, through the control it exerts on microbial mineralization and respiration, has a notable influence on N cycling (Sloth et al. 1995). Deposition and subsequent mineralization of fresh OM releases ammonium (NH + 4 ), which can be converted to nitrate (NO - 3 ) via nitrification (Thamdrup and Dalsgaard 2008), but it also increases benthic respiration and O 2 consumption, therefore constraining the activity of aerobic nitrifiers (Sloth et al. 1995). In sediments where nitrification and denitrification (NO - 3 ! dinitrogen [N 2 ]) processes are tightly coupled, large OM inputs from the pelagic zone can thus reduce denitrification rates (Tuominen et al. 1999). However, opposite effects on denitrification activity have also been documented (Zilius et al. 2016;Marzocchi et al. 2018), notably in areas where theNO - 3 concentration in the overlying water is high (Jensen et al. 1988;Marzocchi et al. 2018). In such cases, denitrifying bacteria are not limited by NO - 3 availability, and OM loading can stimulate denitrification rates through higher provision of organic substrates. In parallel to denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) also has the potential to reduce NO - 3 to NH + 4 in the system, and it may act as the main NO - 3 reduction pathway in high OM loading conditions (Christensen et al. 2000).",False,False,False,
1106,10.1002/lno.11730,3,True,"Relative to OM quantity, the role of settling OM quality on N cycling in sediments has been somewhat less investigated. We hereby define OM quality in a broad sense, encompassing the origin, lability, and biochemical composition of the material. Numerous studies have stressed the influence of OM quality on benthic metabolism (Arnosti and Holmer 2003;Aspetsberger et al. 2007), but to our knowledge, few have specifically targeted effects on N processes such as denitrification or dissolved inorganic N (DIN) release (Oakes et al. 2011;Carlson et al. 2020). Difficulties in addressing the role of OM quality as a rate-controlling parameter also stem from the lack of standard characteristic(s) describing the nature of organic substrates (Arnosti and Holmer 2003;Aspetsberger et al. 2007). Instead, a wide range of indicators have been associated to OM quality (e.g., bulk C : N : P stoichiometry, amino acid, fatty acid, or carbohydrate concentrations), with no consensus arising as to which one(s) could be most relevant for metabolic processes (Tuominen et al. 1996;Arnosti and Holmer 2003;Crawshaw et al. 2019). Yet, some lines of evidence suggest that the C : N ratio of organic substrates partly controls N regeneration from bacteria, and could thus have a direct influence on N cycling at the sediment-water interface (Goldman et al. 1987;Tezuka 1990). With the changes currently at hand in marine ecosystems, further knowledge on the respective leverage of OM quantity and quality on benthic metabolism is needed to anticipate the overall drivers of nutrient cycling and rates of biogeochemical processes at the sediment-water interface.",False,False,False,

We measured O 2 penetration, fluxes of nutrients and O 2 , and NO - 3 reduction rates (i.e., denitrification and DNRA). We hypothesized that (1) bacterial mineralization activity would be stimulated, and denitrification correspondingly inhibited in response to increasing OM loading, owing to tight nitrification-denitrification coupling in Baltic Sea sediment; and (2) this effect would be exacerbated upon settling of spring plankton material, typically considered of high quality for benthic organisms, compared to summer plankton material.

Remaining plankton material was concentrated in a slurry and preserved at -20 C. Shortly before the start of the experiment, the plankton slurries were thawed overnight at 4 C. At this stage, the summer plankton material divided in two distinct layers: cyanobacteria filaments at the surface and zooplankton carcasses at the bottom. The cyanobacteria were isolated and briefly sonicated at low intensity to cause them to sink without destroying cellular integrity (verified visually under a microscope). After thorough homogenization, the particulate organic matter (POM) content of the spring plankton, cyanobacteria, and zooplankton material were measured via losson-ignition (n = 3, see Supplementary method in Supporting Information) and calculated as mg OM mL -1 (Table 1). The cyanobacteria and zooplankton portions of the summer plankton material were eventually pooled back together, with cyanobacteria accounting for 7.1% of the total POM content.

Treatment quantities consisted of low (4 g OM m 2 ) and high (12 g OM m 2 ) OM inputs, corresponding to one and three times the amount of settling OM during the spring bloom in the area (Höglander et al. 2004). The field-collected spring and summer plankton materials were used as two types of OM quality, differing in their species composition and C : N ratio. In addition, a control scenario with no OM addition was implemented. Our experiment therefore comprised five treatments, namely, Control (Ctr), High Spring (H_Spr), Low Spring (L_Spr), High Summer (H_Sum), and Low Summer (L_Sum). Each treatment had a total of eight replicate cores. Two additional control cores were placed in the tank, they did not receive an OM input and were only used as reference for the NO - 3 reduction incubations. Before OM addition, oxygenation and water circulation were paused in the benthic chamber. Following this, cores were taken out individually to proceed with OM addition. The experiment was started (Day 0) by carefully pipetting the plankton slurries at the sediment surface, and the material was allowed to settle overnight. The cores were then randomly placed back in the tank, and oxygenation, water circulation, and magnetic stirring were restarted. The experiment lasted for 10 d, during which the evolution of nutrient and O 2 fluxes at the sediment-water interface, O 2 profiles in the sediment, as well as NO - 3 reduction rates (denitrification and DNRA) were monitored (see timeline in Fig. 1).

Oxygen profiles in the sediment pore water were measured using calibrated microelectrodes (OX-50, Unisense, Denmark), with a depth resolution of 100 μm. The measurements were conducted on 10 sediment cores (two cores per treatment) at Day 4 and Day 9. Individual sediment cores were placed in an aquarium regulated at the same temperature as the experimental conditions (8 C), and a gentle airflow was set up at the surface to create homogeneous conditions in the water column while profiling. The water mixing reduced the diffusive boundary layer substantially, and the position of the sediment-water interface was determined when a sharp decline in O 2 concentration was observed in the profiles.

The incubation protocol followed was slightly modified from Bonaglia et al. (2019). Briefly, the incubation tank water was spiked with 15 NO - 3 , which mixed with endogenous 14 NO - 3 . After 7 h of preincubation, the cores were capped and incubated for 9 h. At the end of the incubation, samples for 29 N 2 , 30 N 2, and 15 NH + 4 were taken to estimate denitrification and DNRA rates, respectively (see details in Supplementary methods in Supporting Information; Nielsen 1992). For the incubations at Days 2 and 6, rates were determined from water column samples only, as measurements of both water column and sediment pore water 29 N 2 , 30 N 2 , and 15 NH + 4 would require sacrificing the cores and turning them into a homogeneous slurry (Nielsen 1992), which would not have allowed us to conduct repeated measurements on the same cores. We thus sacrificed all 42 cores only after the incubation at Day 10 to be able to estimate the proportion of labeled N species present in the water column and that present in the pore water. This method was tested before and shown to work well for muddy Baltic Sea sediments with high porosity (see, e.g., Bonaglia et al., 2017). Between each incubation, the benthic chamber was entirely emptied, rinsed, and filled with fresh bottom water to remove traces of 14 NO - 3 from previous incubations. In addition, most of the water in each sediment core ($ 2/3) was carefully replaced, making sure not to disturb the sediment surface.

Total O 2 uptake (TOU) and nutrient fluxes (NH + 4 , NO - x , PO 3- 4 , H 2 SiO 4 ) across the sediment-water interface were calculated from the difference in concentrations in the overlying water at the beginning and end of the incubation. The volume of incubated water was accounted for and the volume of the magnetic stirrer subtracted for the calculation. Similarly, we calculated the denitrification rate (D 14 ) from the release of 29 N 2 and 30 N 2 in the water, and further distinguished denitrification fueled by water column NO - 3 (D w ) from denitrification coupled to nitrification (D n ) based on the equations in Nielsen (1992). Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium rates was calculated based on 15 NH + 4 release, following the rationale of Risgaard-Petersen and Rysgaard (1995). The proportion of D 15 (F wc 15), D 14 (F wc 14), and DNRA (F wc DNRA) production released in the water column at Day 10 was calculated as follows:
where D wc was measured from the water column samples only, and D slurry was measured from the samples taken after homogenization of the water and sediment surface. Mean values of F wc 15, F wc 14, and F wc DNRA were calculated for the different treatments and used to estimate the overall denitrification and DNRA rates in each core at Day 2 and Day 6, based on the water column measurements (Supporting Information Table S3). The percentage of total inorganic N released as N 2 , or denitrification efficiency (Eyre and Ferguson, 2002), was estimated over the course of the 10 days experiment. To this end, the denitrification rates (D 14 ), NH + 4 and NO -
x fluxes were interpolated at daily intervals between the three incubations using linear regressions. The following formula was then applied to calculate the integrated denitrification efficiency:
where D 14 is the denitrification rate, DIN is the sum of NH + 4 and NO -

When significant differences (p < 0.05) were detected among treatments, this was followed by pairwise t-tests comparisons using Bonferroni corrections. Note that when there was an interactive effect of Treatment : Time, pairwise comparisons were conducted separately for each time point. When the treatments had a significant effect on the variable of interest, we conducted a second test to discriminate the effect of quantity vs. quality of OM through (2) a three-way mixed design ANOVA using quantity and quality of OM as two independent variables, and time as a dependent variable.

## OM sources and sediment characteristics
The spring plankton material was largely dominated by the diatoms Thalassiosira baltica, Pauliella taeniata, along with a few specimens of Melosira baltica, Skeletonema sp., and some benthic pennate diatoms. In the summer plankton, zooplankton (accounting for 92.9% of total POM content) was dominated by the ciliate Helicostomella sp. and zooplankton eggs. Rotifers (Keratella spp.), cladocerans, copepods, and nauplii larvae were all present in lower numbers. Cyanobacteria present in the summer plankton slurry (7.1% of total POM content) were all Nodularia spumigena. The plankton slurries differed in their stoichiometric composition: the N content was nearly four times higher in the summer plankton compared to the spring plankton material (7.4% and 1.9% DW, respectively), and their C : N ratios were 5.6 AE 0.7 and 10.9 AE 0.5, respectively (Table 1).",False,True,True,

Our results showed a clear decline in the oxygen penetration depth after OM addition, notably in the high OM treatments ($ 3.4 mm) compared to control (4.7 mm).

While the quantity of OM had no detectable effect (p = 0.18, Table 2), differences in NO - x fluxes were mainly driven by OM quality (p < 0.001, Table 2).

On the other hand, summer plankton material induced either no changes or a slight stimulation of NO -
x fluxes compared to the control (72-756 μmol m -2 d -1 , Fig. 4a; Table S2). Ammonium fluxes were highly variable throughout the experiment, ranging from -520 to 1464 μmol m -2 d -1 (Fig. 4b). Note that the concentration at the start of Day 1 incubation was higher (2.3 μM) than at Days 5 and 9 (0.2 and 0.3 μM, respectively), and could have influenced the direction of the fluxes. Yet, we were able to detect a significant effect of both OM quantity and quality on NH + 4 fluxes (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively; Supporting Information Table 2). Ammonium release to the water column was particularly high in the High Summer treatment (Fig. 4b, Supporting Information Table S2).

(Fig. 4c,d). Denitrification was predominantly fueled by nitrification (D n 48-99%; D w 1-52%, Supporting Information Table S4). Denitrification fueled by water column NO - 3 was highest at Day 2, shortly after OM addition, notably in the high OM treatments (24.6% AE 1.2% and 36.3% AE 4.1% in High Summer and High Spring, respectively), and then largely dropped at Days 6 and 10 (Supporting Information Table S4).

1125,10.1002/lno.11730,22,True,"## Discussion
## Effects of OM quality on nitrogen cycling
Our results indicate that the quality of OM, that is, spring vs. summer material, was the most important driver of benthic N metabolism, particularly NO -
x fluxes and NO - 3 reduction rates (Table 2). After the settling of spring plankton, NO - x fluxes to the water column decreased substantially, while summer plankton remained comparable to control conditions. Decrease in NO -
x fluxes to the water column following OM sedimentation has been commonly reported and linked to poor O 2 conditions inhibiting nitrification activity in the top sediment layer (Jensen et al. 1990;Hansen and Blackburn 1992;Marzocchi et al. 2018). The 16-48% increase in TOU relative to control observed shortly after OM settling, along with a reduction of oxygen penetration depth to 3.8 mm, clearly indicates that conditions became less favorable for nitrifiers in general, and limited nitrification activity in highly amended cores (Supporting Information Table S4; Thamdrup and Dalsgaard 2008). Nevertheless, O 2 conditions were not markedly different between summer and spring treatments, as indicated by the marginal effect of OM quality on TOU (p = 0.052, Table 2). This did not reflect the pattern observed in fluxes and, therefore, we cannot conclude that nitrification inhibition alone caused the decrease in NO -
x fluxes in the spring compared to the summer treatments. Stimulation of denitrification and DNRA could also theoretically account for a larger NO - x uptake (Hansen and Blackburn 1992;Thamdrup and Dalsgaard 2008). However, our results show that compared to control conditions, denitrification and DNRA rates were not stimulated in the spring treatments, but in the summer treatments, and then only to a minor extent (Fig. 4c,d).",False,True,False,
1126,10.1002/lno.11730,23,True,"We hypothesize that differences in benthic N metabolism were mainly driven by OM elemental stoichiometry. Indeed, the spring and summer planktonic OM did not only differ in terms of taxonomic composition, but they also displayed a twofold difference in bulk C : N ratio (Table 1). In the summer plankton material, the C : N ratio of 5.6 was close to that of live zooplankton and cyanobacteria (Walve and Larsson 2010;Zilius et al. 2016), while the C : N ratio of 10.9 in the spring plankton material was higher than observed in the water column (Walve and Larsson 2010). Although plankton C : N ratio-especially for phytoplankton-can vary depending on environmental conditions (Geider and La Roche 2002), high C : N ratio can also be indicative of decaying OM (Jiao et al. 2010). This is further supported by visual examination of the slurries, which revealed a better integrity of the organisms in the summer than in the spring plankton (Albert S., pers. obs.). OM stoichiometry can in turn influence N dynamics within the microbial compartment, as demonstrated by a number of experimental and modeling studies showing a negative relationship between increasing substrate C : N ratio (C : N S ) and NH + 4 regeneration by bacteria (Goldman et al. 1987;Tezuka 1990;Anderson 1992). Heterotrophic bacteria (C : N $ 5; Fagerbakke et al. 1996) have relatively high N requirements (Van Den Meersche et al. 2004). Therefore, actively growing bacterial population can account for a large portion of total NH + 4 uptake, which can result in temporary N immobilization in the sediment upon OM degradation (Van Duyl et al. 1993). We estimated that in our setup, bacteria incorporated 55% and 28% of the organic N remobilized upon degradation of spring and summer plankton OM, respectively (MI N , see Supporting Information following Canfield et al. (2005), modified after Blackburn (1979)). Some experimental studies suggested a threshold value of C : N S = 10 : 1, below which NH + 4 tends to be excreted upon OM degradation and above which it is immobilized by bacteria (Goldman et al. 1987;Tezuka 1990). In the present study, summer and spring plankton materials were, respectively, below (C : N 5.6) and above (C : N 10.9) this threshold (Table 1), and our observations seem to be in good agreement with this hypothesis.",False,True,False,
1127,10.1002/lno.11730,24,True,"In accordance with our observations, Tuominen et al. (1996) found that lower C : N ratio in limnic seston in summer coincided with larger DIN release from the sediment. Similarly, Oakes et al. (2011) observed a substantial decrease in N 2 fluxes from denitrification under wood derivatives amendments (C : N 28.2) compared to N-rich sludge discharge and phytoplankton (C : N 9.6 and 7.2, respectively). They concluded that this effect was mainly driven by competition for DIN use between nitrifiers/denitrifiers and other microbial heterotrophs. Nevertheless, the highly complex nature of OM calls for caution in using the OM elemental ratio, and notably the threshold of C : N S = 10 : 1 as good predictors of the fate of organic N upon settling to the seafloor (Tezuka 1990). In case of varying size and composition of labile vs. refractory pools for example, bulk C : N ratio may not be representative of the actual OM fraction that bacteria are utilizing as a substrate (Kirchman 1994). Furthermore, oxygen conditions in the sediment could influence the effect of substrate C : N ratio on N cycling. Under anaerobic conditions, microbial growth efficiency is reduced (Ec $ 0.2 for anaerobes vs. 0.5 for aerobes, Pedersen et al. (1999)), and their N requirements are therefore lower. Under these conditions, the C : N S threshold at which bacteria tend to immobilize N would be closer to 25 (Canfield et al. 2005). This could explain why other studies did not find OM bulk C : N ratio a reliable metric to predict O 2 and N 2 exchange rates (Arnosti and Holmer 2003;Crawshaw et al. 2019). Yet, we suggest that variation in C : N S ratio constitutes a plausible explanation for why organic N was largely more mobilized as DIN in the summer vs. spring treatments in our experiment.",False,False,False,
1128,10.1002/lno.11730,25,True,"## Effects of OM quantity on mineralization activity
The effect of OM quantity was most clearly observed on overall mineralization activity and heterotrophic respiration of the benthic compartment. As indicated by the TOU and O 2 penetration depth data, increasing OM loading prompted higher O 2 demand from the sediment community (Fig. 2), and narrowed the depth of the oxic layer (Fig. 3). Our results are well in agreement with the abundant literature documenting the response of benthic metabolism to varying loads of OM (Sloth et al. 1995). What is perhaps most interesting in our findings, and goes partly against the original hypothesis, is that although many N cycling processes are largely governed by O 2 conditions in the sediment (Canfield et al. 2005;Thamdrup and Dalsgaard 2008), the effects of OM loading on O 2 conditions did not directly translate to effects on N cycling. Indeed, the quality of OM exerted a stronger control over N cycling processes such as DIN fluxes and NO - 3 reduction rates than quantity, as previously discussed. Contrary to previous findings by Christensen et al. (2000), we did not observe a higher contribution of DNRA to total NO - 3 reduction with increased OM loading (Fig. 4c). This is likely due to the smaller range of OM input considered in our experiment and the absence of strongly reduced conditions in any of the treatments. In a field study conducted close to our sampling site, Bonaglia et al. (2014) found that DNRA was the dominantNO - 3 reduction pathway only in sediment underlying severely hypoxic bottom water at a site experiencing high nutrient loadings from nearby land and sewage treatment plant. Many studies have demonstrated the importance of both OM quantity (Sloth et al. 1995) and OM quality (Arnosti and Holmer 2003;Aspetsberger et al. 2007;Carlson et al. 2020) as rate-controlling parameters. However, to our knowledge, no study has investigated the two parameters in a way that would disentangle their respective effects on benthic metabolism. While our findings are relevant for most surface coastal sediments, future studies should investigate if the prevalent role of OM quality over quantity on benthic N metabolism found here would hold for benthic ecosystems with a stronger influence of anaerobic processes.",False,False,False,
1129,10.1002/lno.11730,26,True,"## Impact of OM settling on denitrification efficiency
The modifications generated by OM settling on N-cycling mechanism translated in important changes on overall denitrification efficiency of the system, driven predominantly by OM quality (Fig. 6). Assessing denitrification efficiency is a valuable tool to evaluate whether decomposing N is preferentially recycled as bioavailable DIN to the water column, or lost as N 2 (Eyre and Ferguson 2002). Here, denitrification efficiency of 69% AE 6% in the control cores indicated that the sediment had a relatively good capacity to remove bioavailable N. However, throughout the 10 d that followed OM sedimentation, we found that denitrification efficiency tended to decrease in response to an input of summer plankton material (40% AE 5% and 56 AE 4 in the High and Low Summer treatments, respectively), indicating that a larger portion of N returned to the water column in a bioavailable form (NH + 4 or NO -
x ), despite higher denitrification rates (Figs. 4c, 5). On the other hand, spring plankton sedimentation tended to increase denitrification efficiency (88% AE 18% and 115% AE 18% in the High and Low Spring treatments, respectively). Denitrification efficiency varies substantially across marine coastal ecosystems (Seitzinger 1988), and most studies have documented a negative correlation with OM loading (Eyre and Ferguson 2002). Although there was a tendency for high OM loading to decrease denitrification efficiency compared to low OM loading in the summer and spring treatments taken separately, we did not find OM quantity as a major control for denitrification efficiency (Fig. 6). This could be due to the relatively small difference in OM input (4 vs. 12 g OM m -2 ) in our setup compared to the range of OM loading considered in other studies. It is also possible that on a long time scale (e.g., year, decade), denitrification efficiency may be primarily linked to overall OM load input within an ecosystem, while seasonal variations in OM quality could influence denitrification efficiency more periodically in response to OM settling events (Jensen et al. 1990).",False,False,False,
1130,10.1002/lno.11730,27,True,"The presence of macrofauna within our experimental cores significantly influenced some of the benthic processes, including denitrification efficiency to a certain extent. Indeed, although most mineralization activity within marine sediments is attributed to microbial communities (Witte et al. 2003), macrofauna can significantly affect benthic metabolism via their bioturbating activity (Tuominen et al. 1999). Yet, the random distribution of macrofauna assemblages and biomass among the sediment cores (Supporting Information Fig. S2) ensured that the main patterns observed across treatments were not driven by this particular factor. We therefore believe that our observations on the respective effects of OM quality and quantity are solid and consistent enough, and that the presence of larger fauna did not interfere with the core message of this study. Nevertheless, we acknowledge potential caveats of our work, which we ought to be mindful in regard to our interpretations. The relatively short experiment duration does not cover certain benthic processes occurring on a longer time frame. For example, we did not observe an effect of OM treatments on PO 3- 4 nor H 2 SiO 4 fluxes, which are both essential nutrients for pelagic primary production. Upon OM settling, phosphate can be temporarily retained by iron oxyhydroxides in the sediment, and its release to the overlying water will be governed by low O 2 concentrations (Rozan et al. 2002). Considering that our experimental conditions remained oxic for the entire time, this probably explains why we did not observe higher PO 3 - 4 release from the newly settled OM. We also did not notice stronger H 2 SiO 4 fluxes from diatoms in the spring bloom treatments, which may have to do with the short time span of the experiment, as more labile organic molecules are likely to be preferentially degraded (Ehrenhauss and Huettel 2004). Finally, we want to point out that although we added planktonic material composed of both POM and DOM to the sediment cores, we only characterized the POM fraction in our analyses, since the DOM fraction was eluted during the filtration step preceding loss-on-ignition and elemental characterization. Therefore, any substantial difference in the amount of DOM or its qualitative characteristics (notably C : N ratio) between spring and summer plankton slurries would not be reflected in the measurements presented in Table 1. Since DOM directly supports bacterial activity and growth (Middelburg et al. 1993;Van Den Meersche et al. 2004), we cannot exclude that DOM variation might have influenced the results in some way that we cannot account for.",False,True,False,

Results from the present study stress the importance of considering OM quality when addressing the effects of OM settling on N cycling, and, for the first time, on overall denitrification efficiency. In a context of rapid environmental change in the ocean, substantial consequences are predicted for pelagic primary (Finkel et al. 2010) and secondary production (Aberle et al. 2015). Changes in pelagic production will inevitably cascade down and affect both the quantity and quality of OM exported to the seafloor (Griffiths et al. 2017;Tamelander et al. 2017). Data records and modeling studies suggest an ongoing shift toward small-sized planktonic organisms (Mäkinen et al. 2017) and more buoyant ones such as cyanobacteria (Paerl and Huisman 2009) in marine systems.Along with predictions of higher heterotrophic metabolism in the pelagic zone due to increasing water temperatures (IPCC 2014), future climate scenarios could thus result in a reduction of OM sedimentation fluxes, which may favor settling of more degraded OM to the seafloor (Tamelander et al. 2017).",False,False,False,
1132,10.1002/lno.11730,29,True,"Based on the observations presented here, settlement of degraded OM with higher C : N ratio would result in higher denitrification efficiency. We estimated that for the same amount of OM, an increase in C : N ratio from 5.6 to 10.9 would translate into a doubling of denitrification efficiency capacity in the sediment. However, in order to evaluate potential implications for the overall N budget, we must consider the entire picture from primary production at the sea surface to decomposition in the sediment. For instance, in coastal Baltic Sea environments, the vast majority of N removal is achieved via benthic denitrification (92%, Almroth-Rosell et al. 2016). If residence time in the water column increases, planktonic OM will be more degraded by the time it reaches the sediment, and only a small portion of the original organic N would be efficiently denitrified, while a larger fraction would have instead been remineralized to DIN in the pelagic zone. This calls for a broadening of our perspective on some of the challenges and modifications that ecosystems are currently facing. The questions surrounding the quantity and quality of OM vertical fluxes in a fast-evolving climate need to be addressed particularly, as it will be fundamental in order to evaluate the consequences of environmental changes on biogeochemical fluxes.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
Isotopic enrichment factors are key to using stable isotope signatures in biogeochemical studies. However, these are typically determined in laboratory experiments and their applicability to environmental conditions is difficult to test. Here, we analyzed nitrogen stable isotope changes associated with nitrification in a coastal basin using weekly time-series measurements of δ 15 N in particulate nitrogen, ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate. Two year-long time series were selected as contrasting natural experiments in the ammonium-rich, aphotic bottom water of Bedford Basin, Nova Scotia, Canada. In 2014, ammonia oxidation (AO) was associated with Thaumarchaeota and nitrite concentrations remained low (< 0.5 μmol kg À1 ). In contrast, transient nitrite accumulation (~8 μmol kg À1 ) and a more rapid δ 15 N NH4 increase in the fall of 2017 were likely caused by ammoniaoxidizing bacteria, associated with higher AO rates and, possibly, stronger nitrogen-isotope enrichment ( 15 ε AO ). Estimates of 15 ε AO (21.8 AE 2.2‰, 24.1 AE 1.1‰) were derived empirically using Rayleigh models applied to field data from restricted periods during which the bottom waters approximated a closed system and influence on 15 ε AO from other processes was demonstrably insignificant. Using a numerical reactive-transport model, we found that the best fit for the δ 15 N data was obtained with 15 ε AO values (18.9‰, 25.1‰) close to those determined by the Rayleigh models. The time series also revealed substantial (~7‰) 15 N-enrichment of the particulate nitrogen due to light-independent assimilation of partially nitrified ammonium. Consistent with previous studies, these field-based nitrogen isotope fractionation experiments suggest that the range of 15 ε AO values relevant for marine systems may be narrower than determined in laboratory studies.",False,False,False,

Nitrification plays a central role in the nitrogen (N) cycle by oxidizing ammonia (NH 3 ) via nitrite (NO À 2 ) to nitrate (NO À 3 ), thereby determining the speciation of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN = ammonium/ammonia + nitrite + nitrate). This is a crucial prerequisite for the removal of fixed N, as both denitrification and anammox require oxidized DIN (nitrite or nitrate) to produce N 2 . DIN speciation also affects phytoplankton ecology as a high proportion of ammonium relative to nitrate has been associated with shifts in primary production and phytoplankton communities and might be a causal factor for harmful algal blooms (Berg et al. 2003;Glibert et al. 2016).The two steps of nitrification, ammonia oxidation (AO) to nitrite and nitrite oxidation (NO) to nitrate, are typically catalyzed by two different microorganisms. Ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) are the dominant ammonia oxidizers in the open ocean (Francis et al. 2005;Wuchter et al. 2006), whereas ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) play important roles in other aquatic environments including some coastal systems (Li et al. 2015;Happel et al. 2018). This reflects niche differentiation caused by higher substrate affinity of AOA compared to AOB (Martens-Habbena et al. 2009). Along with differences in the enzymatic AO pathways between AOB and AOA (Vajrala et al. 2013;Martens-Habbena et al. 2015;Kozlowski et al. 2016), these kinetic differences might lead to differences in stable isotope fractionation. On the other hand, both AOB and AOA produce hydroxylamine as a first intermediary product from ammonia (Vajrala et al. 2013) and laboratory-based studies found neither differences in N isotope fractionation between AOA and AOB, nor a clear relationship between AO rates and N isotope fractionation (Casciotti et al. 2003;Santoro and Casciotti 2011;Nishizawa et al. 2016).

The isotopic mechanisms associated with nitrite that accumulates within marine oxygen-deficient zones have been investigated more thoroughly (Bourbonnais et al. 2015;Buchwald et al. 2015;Hu et al. 2016), but the main production (nitrate reduction vs. AO) and removal (nitrite reduction vs. NO) processes of nitrite differ under anoxic conditions. Thus, studies of the isotope effects associated with nitrite accumulation occurring under oxic conditions are necessary.

Importantly, the BB experiences annual mixing-stratification cycles. During the stratified period, the bottom water is disconnected from nearsurface water and water outside the basin due to a 20-m-deep sill.

## BB: Study site
The BB is a 71-m deep, 17-km 2 fjord-like embayment located in the urban core of the Halifax Regional Municipality, Nova Scotia, Canada (Fig. 1). Freshwater input (5.3 m 3 s À1 ) is small compared to the mean tidal volume entering the basin (2.5 Â 10 7 m 3 ) and the total basin volume of 5.1 Â 10 8 m 3 (Petrie and Yeats 1990;Gregory 1993). The average flushing time of the basin is about 91 d (Shan and Sheng 2012) but the bottom water residence time can be as high as 194 d during stratified periods (Burt et al. 2013;Haas et al. 2021). It receives anthropogenic nutrient input from several wastewater treatment plants in the region, one of which drains directly into the basin (Kerrigan et al. 2017).A two-layer estuarine-type circulation moves relatively saline water into the BB in a deeper layer and relatively fresh water out toward the Halifax Harbor and the Scotian Shelf (Petrie and Yeats 1990;Fader and Miller 2008;Shan et al. 2011).

Briefly, a 2.5 mmol L À1 sulfamic acid solution in 25% HCl was added to each sample to a final concentration of 10 μmol L À1 to remove any pre-existing nitrite (Granger and Sigman 2009). Then, NaCl (combusted for 24 h at 450 C to remove any Nimpurities) was added to increase salinity to 5 mol L À1 and the pH was buffered at about 9 by the addition of MgO. To each 15 mL sample, ~0.6 g of activated cadmium was added before the samples were placed on a reciprocal shaker overnight at 75 rpm. The next day, they were centrifuged and the reduction efficiency was checked using the standard photometric assay (Hansen and Koroleff 1999) to compare nitrite levels with initial nitrate concentrations for each sample.

Instead, the July 2014 intrusion was assumed to bring Scotian Shelf water with negligible ammonium and nitrite concentrations (0 μmol kg À1 ) and nitrate concentrations (2.5 μmol kg À1 ) and δ 15 N NO3 (4.6‰) values as observed in September 2014 in Scotian Shelf waters near Halifax (Lehmann, Buchwald, and Kienast unpubl. data).

## Physico-chemical conditions
The mixing regime of BB is characterized by an annual cycle of full water-column mixing in winter and stratified conditions in summer/fall. Stratification begins in approximately March/April and lasts until December to February, when it breaks down due to strong wintertime heat loss (Li and Harrison 2008;Shan et al. 2011). Winter mixing brings colder, less saline, and more oxygenated surface water to deeper layers (Fig. 3a-f). Occasional shelf water intrusion events occur in many years, interrupting the isolation of the bottom water during the stratified period by introducing relatively warm, saline, nutrient-poor and oxygen-rich water from the Scotian Shelf into the bottom or mid-depths of the basin (Platt et al. 1972;Burt et al. 2013;Shi and Wallace 2018).Increasing vertical temperature gradients (Fig. 3a,b) and a steady oxygen decrease at 60 m (Fig. 4a,b) indicated the beginning of seasonal stratification in mid-March of both study years. The 2014 stratified period was interrupted by a shelfwater intrusion in mid-July, which increased temperature and salinity at 60 m and caused oxygen to increase by 140 μmol kg À1 between two weekly measurements (Figs. 3a-c, 4a). A similar intrusion occurred in December 2017 as indicated by a sharp increase of oxygen (Fig. 4b). In addition, in mid-July 2017, an intrusion to the mid-depths of the basin brought more saline water (Fig. 3d; see also Shi and Wallace 2018).

In late September 2017, however, nitrite accumulated to a maximum of 8.1 μmol kg À1 , coinciding with the period of rapid ammonium decrease (Fig. 5f).

Then, coincident with an ammonium concentration decrease, δ 15 N NH4 rapidly increased, reaching annual maxima in October of 2014 (40.1‰) and 2017 (78.0‰). δ 15 N NO3 decreased steadily in both years starting with the beginning of the stratified period (Fig. 5g,h). Given that δ 15 N NH4 was almost constant between April and September (Fig. 5c,d), this implies continuous preferential transfer of isotopically light ammonium by nitrification to the pre-existing nitrate pool (2.7 μmol kg À1 ), similar to previous observations (Sebilo et al. 2006).

In the following discussion, the time-series observations of PON and DIN isotopic composition are put into the context of available literature and analyzed quantitatively using both numerical modeling over the entire annual cycle and closedsystem Rayleigh models applied to restricted periods. δ 15 N PON increase due to dark ammonium assimilation Parallel with the δ 15 N NH4 increase observed in September and October 2014, which was caused by isotope fractionation during AO, we observed a simultaneous δ 15 N PON increase of 7‰ (Fig. 4c). An absence of Chl a increase in the bottom water (Fig. 3g) and the steady δ 15 N PON values observed in near-surface water throughout the year (Fig. 4c) imply that the δ 15 N PON increase in the bottom water was not caused by PON sinking from surface waters, but rather by 15 N-enrichment of the PON suspended within the bottom water. Ammonification is associated with a small isotopic enrichment effect (1-4‰; Silfer et al. 1992;Möbius 2013) that might cause the constant small offset observed between near-surface and bottom water δ 15 N PON prior to September, but cannot explain the increase by ~7‰ between September and November 2014 in bottom water only (Fig. 4c). This increase could, however, be explained by partial transmission of the increasingly high δ 15 N NH4 signal into biomass via ammonium uptake by heterotrophic microbes or by the chemolithoautotrophic nitrifiers themselves (Supporting Information Section S4). This is consistent with metaproteomic evidence reported by Georges et al. (2014), who found ammonium-assimilation related protein sequences that were affiliated with AOA in BB bottom water. Moreover, as discussed in Supporting Information Section S4, the consistently higher δ 15 N PON in the bottom water compared to surface waters (Fig. 4c) suggests that dark ammonium assimilation occurred throughout the 2014 stratified period, that is, also prior to the obvious δ 15 N PON signal in fall.",False,False,False,
1160,10.1002/lno.12161,24,True,"Assimilation of partially nitrified ammonium by phytoplankton has been linked previously with increases of δ 15 N PON observed within the euphotic zones of estuaries (Mariotti et al. 1984;Middelburg and Nieuwenhuize 1998), the Sea of Okhotsk (Yoshikawa et al. 2005), a seasonally stratified lake (Hadas et al. 2009), the North Pacific Western Subarctic Gyre (Mino et al. 2016), and under sea-ice in the Bering Sea (Granger et al. 2011;Morales et al. 2014). Given the absence of light in BB bottom water (Taguchi and Platt 1977), our observations reveal an analogous process of δ 15 N PON increase due to the lightindependent assimilation of 15 N-enriched ammonium by heterotrophic (Middelburg and Nieuwenhuize 2000;Allen et al. 2002) and/or chemolithoautotrophic microorganisms. This might have different implications than the previously described δ 15 N PON alteration by phytoplankton assimilation of incompletely nitrified ammonium, as it can cause δ 15 N PON to increase also below the euphotic zone. Subsurface changes in the isotopic composition of PON are usually attributed to isotope fractionation during selective degradation of N-containing organic fractions (Altabet 1988;Altabet and Francois 1994;Lourey et al. 2003). It remains to be seen whether dark assimilation of partially nitrified ammonium might play a significant role for subsurface alteration of δ 15 N PON elsewhere in the ocean or in ocean sediments.",False,False,False,

The steady DIN concentrations and δ 15 N DIN indicate low rates of DIN addition or removal processes like ammonification. Together with the concomitant ammonium decrease, this suggests a switch from pre-dominant ammonification to pre-dominant nitrification in early September of both years, that is, shortly before the ""Rayleigh closed-system periods."" This switch was reflected in the modeled rates (Fig. 5a,b). We note that the bottom-water O 2 concentrations during these ""Rayleigh closed-system periods"" were too high (> 85 μmol kg À1 ; Fig. 4a,b) to allow for significant DIN loss due to water-column denitrification or anammox (Jensen et al. 2008(Jensen et al. , 2009)). DIN assimilation by photoautotrophs can also be excluded given the absence of light in BB bottom water (Taguchi and Platt 1977).",False,False,False,
1162,10.1002/lno.12161,26,True,"Thus, for both years, a Rayleigh closed-system period was defined to start when DIN reached a plateau and ammonium concentrations began to drop, and to end when ammonium concentration stopped decreasing. With this model, the isotopic enrichment factor for AO, 15 ε AO , can be approximated by the slope of the linear fit applied to the ammonium series (Fig. 6), expressed as follows (Mariotti et al. 1981):
with δ S denoting the δ 15 N of the substrate (ammonium) and f is the fraction of unreacted substrate. The slope determined for the 2014 and 2017 closed-system Rayleigh model fits in Fig. 6a,c represented the isotopic enrichment during ammonium utilization ( 15 ε AU ), 21.6 AE 2.2‰ in 2014 and 24.1 AE 1.1‰ in 2017 (Table 2). Despite the previously discussed evidence for dark ammonium assimilation, negligible influence of ammonium assimilation on ammonium isotope fractionation was assumed given the observed lack of PON concentration increase during the Rayleigh closed-system periods (Fig. 4a,b). For 2014, the contribution of PO 14 N and PO 15 N to isotopic variations in the ammonium pool was estimated on the basis of measured PON concentration and δ 15 N PON increase, and subsequently used to correct the δ 15 N NH4 increase during the Rayleigh closedsystem period for the contribution of ammonium assimilation (Supporting Information Section S5). This yielded a 15 ε AO which was not substantially different from the 15 ε AU (Fig. 6a, b; Table 2), supporting our assumption of negligible contribution of ammonium assimilation to isotope fractionation. Given between-year similarity in PON concentrations (Fig. 4a, b) and the good agreement between the substrate-based Rayleigh models (Fig. 6) and the product-based Rayleigh models described in Supporting Information Section S6 (Supporting Information Fig. S3), we assumed that the difference between 15 ε AO and 15 ε AU was also small in 2017. An alternative approach to estimating the isotopic enrichment factor of AO can use the difference between the values of the y-intercepts of the products' (nitrate + nitrite) and substrate's (ammonium/ammonia) curves on the closed-system Rayleigh model (Mariotti et al. 1981). In 2014 (Fig. 6b), this difference (20.6 AE 1.7‰) did not significantly differ from the 15 ε AO determined via the ammonium slope (21.8 AE 2.2‰; Table 2). However, in 2017 (Fig. 6c), a slightly larger and significant difference was observed between the two estimates (slope: 24.1 AE 1.1‰; intercepts: 31.3 AE 1.6‰). It is unlikely that this discrepancy indicates a substantial influence of processes other than nitrification on N isotope fractionation during the 2017 Rayleigh closed-system period, given good agreement between the substrate-based Rayleigh models (Fig. 6) and the product-based Rayleigh models described in Supporting Information Section S6 (Supporting Information Fig. S3) as well as between predicted and observed δ 15 N NO3 (Supporting Information Fig. S4, Section S7). As discussed below, analysis of the reactive-transport model results suggests that the difference may instead be the result of a change in 15 ε AO associated with the succession of AOB and AOA.",False,True,False,
1163,10.1002/lno.12161,27,True,"## Testing the closed-system assumption
The sensitivity of the determined 15 ε AO values to the closed-system assumption made for the fall periods of 2014 and 2017 can be tested by comparing them to the outcome under the opposite, open-system assumption (Supporting Information Section S8). The application of open-system Rayleigh models to the time series resulted in 15 ε AO values approximately 8‰ smaller than those determined with the closedsystem models (Supporting Information Fig. S5). As discussed in Supporting Information Section S8, this relatively small difference despite the unrealistic open-system assumption suggests limited sensitivity of the determined 15 ε AO values to the closed-system assumption.",False,False,False,
1164,10.1002/lno.12161,28,True,"Yet, the appropriateness of the closed-system assumption is called into question by a steady oxygen decrease during the Rayleigh closed-system periods. The oxygen decrease was only partially explained (22% in 2014, 29% in 2017) by the oxygen demand of nitrification, which was estimated on the basis of observed ammonium decrease and assuming a stoichiometry of 2 mol O 2 used per mol of NH þ 4 reduced to NO À 3 (Gruber 2008). The remainder of the oxygen decrease was likely caused by the remineralization of organic matter (including ammonification) within the water column and an oxygen flux to the sediments. Hence, the measured isotope signatures and derived isotopic enrichment effects may be subject to influence by benthic exchanges that cannot be fully resolved by our dataset. Benthic nitrification and denitrification might influence the isotopic composition of ammonium and nitrate in the water column as demonstrated in other parts of the ocean (Lehmann et al. 2005;Granger et al. 2011;Alkhatib et al. 2012). To estimate the benthic ammonium flux to the bottom water, we compared the bi-annual average (2014 and 2017) of modeled ammonification rates in the bottom water (170.5 nmol kg À1 d À1 ) with benthic ammonium effluxes estimated on the basis of water-sediment O 2 -fluxes, which for BB have only been reported by Hargrave (1978): 13.21 AE 7.60 mmol m À2 d À1 (annual average AE SD). Assuming that the oxygen flux to the sediments is exclusively used for the remineralization of organic matter with Redfield stoichiometry (118 mol O 2 yielding 16 mol ammonium; Gruber 2008) gives an estimated ammonium efflux of 1.8 mmol m À2 d À1 . Since this estimate assumes that there are no within-sediment ammonium losses (e.g., nitrification, assimilation), it is an upper bound and of course also uncertain due to the historical O 2 -flux data it is based on. These caveats notwithstanding, the estimated ammonium flux is about five times smaller than the modeled ammonification rates (170.5 nmol kg À1 d À1 = 8.7 mmol m À2 d À1 , assuming a 50-m deep bottom-water layer and observed average density of 1.0247 kg L À1 ), suggesting a maximum ~20% contribution of benthic ammonification to the bottom water ammonium pool.",False,False,False,
1165,10.1002/lno.12161,29,True,"Despite this apparently small contribution, we cannot a priori exclude an influence of this benthic ammonium flux on our 15 ε AO estimates. If nitrification in BB sediments was negligible, benthos-derived ammonium would be affected only by the small 15 ε associated with ammonification (Möbius 2013) and might therefore be relatively 15 N-depleted compared to bottom-water ammonium during the Rayleigh closed-system period. Addition of such low-δ 15 N ammonium to the bottom water would result in underestimation of the 15 ε AO on the basis of the observed δ 15 N NH4 increase during the Rayleigh closed-system periods (Fig. 6). However, any benthic nitrification, which is likely occurring given the oxygen flux to the sediments, would tend to lessen this effect by decreasing the flux and increasing the δ 15 N of sediment-derived ammonium, thereby bringing it closer to the δ 15 N NH4 values in the bottom-water (Brandes and Devol 1997;Granger et al. 2011). Therefore, the influence of benthic ammonium on the δ 15 N of the similarly 15 N-enriched bottom water ammonium during the Rayleigh closed-system periods was likely small.We also note that neither the concentration (Fig. 4b) nor the δ 15 N (8.6-10.6‰; Fig. 6c) of total DIN changed over time during the Rayleigh closed-system period of 2017.

Influx of isotopically light benthic ammonium seems unlikely as the δ 15 N NH4 in marine sediments (Brandes and Devol 1997;Granger et al. 2011) tends to be significantly higher than the bottom-water δ 15 N NO3 during the Rayleigh closed-system periods. Similarly, any ammonium produced from PON by ammonification (associated with small isotope fractionation of 1-4‰; Silfer et al. 1992;Möbius 2013) in the bottom water would increase the δ 15 N DIN , since the δ 15 N PON was 11-14‰ higher than the δ 15 N NO3 at 60 m at any point during these periods (Figs. 4a,5g,h). Hence, the observed, steady DIN during the Rayleigh closed-system period appears inconsistent with a balance between ammonium addition and nitrate loss, since this would have likely acted to increase the δ 15 N DIN in bottom water, which is not consistent with the observations (Fig. 6c). Overall, the DIN concentration and isotope data in the bottom water appear consistent with a closed system within which little DIN is added or removed, suggesting negligible influence of processes other than water-column-based nitrification (see also Supporting Information Section S7) on the isotope fractionation factors estimated by closed-system Rayleigh models (Table 2). Nevertheless, a study focused on benthic isotope dynamics and nitrogen budgets is needed to fully test this assumption and quantify any influence of sedimentary processes.",False,True,False,

(2021). To model the large nitrite accumulation observed in September 2017, the AO rate constant was increased by a factor of 3.5 (determined empirically for best model fit) during the time period in which AOB growth was observed by Haas et al. (2021). This reflects the faster AO kinetics of AOB compared to those of the AOA, which are the dominant ammonia oxidizers in BB bottom water at most other times (Martens-Habbena et al. 2009;Haas et al. 2021).Model output was used to test the assumption of a Rayleigh closed system for the selected periods of the time series. The closed-system assumption requires that external input or output of DIN was negligible during these defined periods of nitrification and therefore that the residence time of DIN in the bottom water is much greater than the duration of the selected periods of the time series. We assessed this by dividing the mean DIN concentration during each Rayleigh closedsystem period by the sum of the mean modeled ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate fluxes during the same periods as shown in (Table 3). The DIN residence times (2014: 175 d, 2017: 260 d) were indeed much greater than the duration of the Rayleigh closed-system periods (35/49 d), again consistent with the assumption of a closed system for these restricted periods.",False,True,False,
1169,10.1002/lno.12161,33,True,"On the basis of the model's ability to reproduce the trends in DIN concentrations of both years (Fig. 5c-h), the best-fit 15 ε AO (2014: 18.9‰, 2017: 25.1‰) and 15 ε NO (2014: À1.6‰, 2017: À6.2‰) combinations were estimated by least-square fitting of the model to the time-series δ 15 N observations. The resulting model reproduced the overall trends and prominent features observed in the N stable isotope time series, including the steep increases in δ 15 N NH4 , δ 15 N NO2 , and δ 15 N NO3 during the Rayleigh closed-system periods as well as the preceding δ 15 N NO3 minimum (Fig. 5c-h). Notably, the 15 ε AO values that resulted in the best model fit to each year's observation were very similar to the 15 ε AO values determined by the closedsystem Rayleigh models (Table 2).The model output also matched the δ 15 N NO2 increases observed at the end of each year, which were driven by the transfer of ammonium-N by AO from the increasingly 15 Nenriched ammonium pool (Fig. 5e,f). However, the model did not capture the small-scale variations in nitrite concentration prior to July 2017 and throughout most of 2014. These may have been caused by asynchronous variations in AO and NO or, possibly, by release of nitrite from the sediment. Therefore, the 15 ε NO values determined by best fit to each year's observations (À1.6 and À6.2‰ for 2014 and 2017, respectively) are low-confidence estimates, unlike the 15 ε AO values. Varying the modeled 15 ε AO within the range of values reported in the literature (7-43‰) resulted in mismatches with the observed δ 15 N time series of the three DIN species. This increases confidence in the 15 ε AO estimates derived from the reactive-transport model and suggests strong sensitivity of the model to the 15 ε AO parameter (Supporting Information Fig. S6).",False,True,False,
1170,10.1002/lno.12161,34,True,"Using phylogenetic marker genes, we previously identified a succession of AOB followed by AOA in the fall of 2017 in the BB bottom water (Haas et al. 2021). These data are presented in Fig. 7c as the AOB : AOA ratio. It shows an AOB : AOA maximum in the middle of the 2017 Rayleigh closed-system period, which suggests a switch from AOB predominance to mostly AOA-driven AO at this time. We hypothesize that differences in 15 ε AO between the AOB and AOA may have caused the significant differences between the ammonium slope and the ammonium-NO À
x intercept difference from the 2017 closed-system Rayleigh model discussed above (Fig. 6c; Table 2). We tested this using a model experiment (Fig. 7) in which the 15 ε AO was increased to the 15 ε AO value suggested by the closed-system Rayleigh-model ammonium-NO À

Since the 15 ε AO value suggested by the ammonium slope of the 2017 closed-system Rayleigh model (24.0 AE 2.2‰) closely matches the value (25.1‰) determined via the least-square fitting of the model to the observation for the full year (during which AOB only dominated during a short period; Fig. 7c), these values likely approximate the 15 ε AO associated with AOA in 2017, whereas the ammonium-NO À

x utilizing processes were negligible during the Rayleigh closedsystem periods. As established above and in Supporting Information Sections S5 and S6, the influence of processes affecting the ammonium pool (ammonification, ammonium assimilation) was likely negligible during the Rayleigh closed-system periods.Inter-annual similarity in δ 15 N patterns despite biogeochemical differences
The overall seasonal variability of δ 15 N of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate was quite similar between the two study years despite differences in nitrite accumulation and ammonia oxidizer type. Inter-annual similarities included the steady δ 15 N NH4 prior to sudden increase in fall (Fig. 5c,d), the minima of δ 15 N NO2 and δ 15 N NO3 coincident with the beginning of the δ 15 N NH4 increase and the eventual steep increase also of δ 15 N NO2 and δ 15 N NO3 (Fig. 5e,f). This suggests that the 2017 nitrite accumulation and the inter-annual differences in AOA/AOB patterns had only subtle effects on the major trends in N isotope fractionation during nitrification.These subtle effects may include the inter-annual differences in the magnitude and rate of change in δ 15 N parameters. Higher maximum δ 15 N NH4 values and steeper δ 15 N NO2 and δ 15 N NO3 increase were observed in September/October 2017 compared to 2014 (Fig. 5c-h). These were probably caused by higher AO rates and, potentially, higher 15 ε AO , associated with transient pre-dominance of AOB observed in 2017 but not in 2014 (Haas et al. 2021), leading to more rapid 15 Nenrichment of the ammonium pool and transfer of this highδ 15 N signal into the nitrite and nitrate pools.",False,True,False,

Several studies have estimated isotopic enrichment factors for nitrification in aquatic systems on the basis of field data (Table 1). The challenge such studies face is to distinguish between the many processes that can influence the δ 15 N of ammonium, nitrite, and nitrate, which usually prevents wellconstrained estimation of 15 ε AO . The present study relies on unusually high data density, isotopic information from PON and the three main DIN species as well as favorable environmental conditions (dark, sufficiently oxygenated) that minimize the impact of confounding processes (e.g., denitrification, N assimilation by phototrophs). Therefore, the field-based 15 ε AO values determined here can approximate the accuracy with which these factors can be measured in laboratory-based studies and can inform future research, especially where environmental factors (e.g., ammonium concentration, bacterial vs. archaeal ammonia oxidizer) are similar to those found in BB bottom waters (see also Haas et al. 2021).The N isotopic enrichment factors for AO and nitrification determined here (Table 2) lie well within the wide range (13-43‰) reported from culture-based studies (Delwiche and Steyn 1970;Mariotti et al. 1981;Casciotti et al. 2003Casciotti et al. , 2010b;;Santoro and Casciotti 2011;Nishizawa et al. 2016;Mooshammer et al. 2020).

An explanation for the higher 15 ε AO values derived from studies with laboratory cultures might be the accumulation of an AO intermediary product induced by experimental conditions such as high substrate availability (Santoro and Casciotti 2011;Mooshammer et al. 2020). Indeed, recent evidence suggests that both AOB and AOA produce intermediary products between ammonia and nitrite (Vajrala et al. 2013;Martens-Habbena et al. 2015;Caranto and Lancaster 2017). Alternatively, high 15 ε AO values determined under laboratory conditions may be explained by the rate of AO relative to the rate of ammonium entering the periplasm, causing high 15 ε AO in the presence of high ammonium concentrations (Casciotti et al. 2010a). Inherent in both explanations is the possibility that the upper range of 15 ε AO determined in laboratory studies may not be relevant to the natural environment. While further research is necessary to establish this firmly, the well-constrained, field-based 15 ε AO estimates reported here provide further indication that only a subset (≤ 31‰) of the 15 ε AO range determined from culturebased studies is environmentally relevant.

The high resolution of this coastal time series and the long summer-fall stratified period during which the BB could be approximated as a closed system, allowed for well-constrained estimations of isotopic enrichment factors (2014: 21.8‰; 2017: 24.1‰) for AO using closed-system Rayleigh models. The close agreement with isotopic enrichment factors determined by a reactive-transport model covering the full annual cycles provides confidence that these factors can, in principle, be determined with reasonable accuracy by numerical models that are well constrained by observations and take into account relevant physical and biogeochemical processes.The overall trends of observed N isotope signatures were similar between two biogeochemically different years, suggesting that nitrite accumulation caused by transient decoupling of nitrification in 2017 did not produce a distinct pattern in δ 15 N NO2 signatures (or δ 15 N of other DIN species). The steeper δ 15 N NH4 increase observed in 2017, however, may have been caused by faster AO rates and higher 15 ε AO associated with AOB compared to the AOA which dominated in 2014.We observed an increase of δ 15 N PON in the sub-euphotic zone that paralleled the δ 15 N NH4 increase caused by nitrification and suggested there was 15 N-enrichment of suspended particulate organic matter via dark assimilation of partially nitrified ammonium by chemolithoautotrophs or heterotrophs. This effect should be considered when interpreting vertical profiles or time series of δ 15 N PON . Generally, results from this study highlight discrepancies between laboratoryand field-based isotopic enrichment factors that should be explored further with more detailed laboratory analyses and additional, highly resolved field-based time series.### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1.

## Abstract
Estimating the long-term sedimentary carbon sinks of mangroves and other blue carbon ecosystems has rapidly become a focus of coastal research and conservation attention. Sampling coverage, however, remains low, with sediment cores sparsely distributed across a subset of mangrove environmental settings globally. Furthermore, the ecological and geological drivers of variation in these stocks remain incompletely understood. We assessed the limits of mangrove sedimentary carbon storage by sampling sediments in diverse mangrove environments across four geographic areas: the volcanic Galapagos, the arid Baja Peninsula, and the geologically and climatically distinct Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Panama. At 80 sites across these areas, we quantified the organic carbon density, sampled with depth, of entire sediment columns. Depth-integrated carbon stocks are highly variable, from <17 to >1700 MgC org ha À1 . The positive relationship between sediment carbon density and annual rainfall demonstrated in global studies was not observed across these areas, though some carbon density differences were evident. Variation in sediment depth, ranging from 7 to 427 cm across sites, largely explained variation in carbon stock across the areas studied. These results underscore the importance of using measurements of sediment depth to estimate carbon stock. Long-term geomorphological processes, such as the build-up of sediment deposits shaped by coastal dynamics, play a major role in shaping mangrove carbon stocks. Investigating and accounting for these processes will enable more accurate estimation of this variable and valuable carbon pool.Since the Industrial Revolution, we humans have unearthed and burned millions of years' worth of plant and algal organic carbon stored via burial in shallow marine and wetland environments, that is, fossil fuels. Oxidizing and releasing this organic carbon pool has increased the concentration of CO 2 in the atmosphere and led to global climate change (Ciais et al. 2013). In recent decades, researchers have focused attention on the ecosystems that today are fixing CO 2 as organic matter and storing it underground, in some measure counterbalancing human greenhouse gas emissions. Highly productive and efficient at preserving plant detritus in anoxic, accumulating sediments, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds have been identified as ""blue carbon ecosystems,"" that is, hotspots of marine organic carbon burial (Nellemann et al. 2009). Measurements of their carbon sequestration rates (Mcleod et al. 2011), the net amount of organic carbon accumulated each year, have been gathered, making possible estimates of the value in terms of future CO 2 drawdown of maintaining or restoring these ecosystems. In contrast, studies of the magnitudes of their carbon stocks, an integration of long-term carbon storage in sediment over time (Pendleton et al. 2012), elucidate the greenhouse gas emissions risk associated with their destruction, estimated at >2 Pg CO 2eq for global mangroves (Adame et al. 2021).",True,False,True,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds**. They are specifically defined as **""blue carbon ecosystems,"" which are hotspots of marine organic carbon burial**. 

The context further defines them by their attributes of being **highly productive and efficient at preserving plant detritus in anoxic, accumulating sediments**. Additionally, their carbon sequestration *rates* (net amount of organic carbon accumulated each year) and *carbon stocks* (integration of long-term carbon storage in sediment over time) are quantitative attributes used to define and study them."

Both aspects of blue carbon are highly relevant to climate change mitigation. More than 35% of the mangrove area has already been lost (Valiela et al. 2001), creating ample room for restoration, estimated at >8000 km 2  (Worthington and Spalding 2018). Though mangrove deforestation globally has slowed in recent decades, more than 100 km 2 is still lost annually (Goldberg et al. 2020), resulting in large emissions of stored carbon (Kauffman et al. 2017). There has been a push to map out the distribution of blue carbon stocks globally, especially to facilitate the development of blue carbon inventories for integration into national climate change mitigation plans and carbon markets (Crooks et al. 2018). Despite the recent uptick in interest in regional blue carbon distributions, however, understanding of the ecological and geological processes that govern the preservation of long-term carbon stocks is still new and developing.Mangroves store more carbon below ground per unit area than most other forests (Donato et al. 2011) and tend to have the largest stocks among blue carbon ecosystems (Pendleton et al. 2012). They have been recognized for decades as ecosystem service hotspots (Costanza et al. 1997), providing fisheries nursery habitat (Aburto-Oropeza et al. 2008), timber, run-off purification, and protection from erosion and storm events (Ewel et al. 1998;Walters et al. 2008). Like other blue carbon ecosystems, mangroves are highly productive, with rates of net primary productivity of 13.6 AE 4.5 MgC org ha À1 yr À1 (mean AE SE, throughout; Bouillon et al. 2008). Terrestrial tropical forests can also achieve high rates of carbon uptake (Dixon et al. 1994); what sets mangroves apart is not their productivity but the high burial efficiency of autochthonous and allochthonous production (Duarte and Cebri an 1996), leading to the accumulation of organic-carbon-rich deposits often meters deep and millennia old. Determining the environmental controls on this process of forming long-lived peat can improve the understanding of mangroves' blue carbon functioning.",False,False,True,
1186,10.1002/lno.12241,2,True,"A few studies have gathered mangrove datasets from around the world to build models of regional variation in the pools of carbon in these ecosystems. Jardine and Siikamäki (2014) predicted mangrove sediment carbon densities globally in a model driven mainly by annual rainfall and latitude, and Sanders et al. (2016) identified a positive correlation between belowground carbon stock and annual rainfall. More local scale models have shown similar predictive power of rainfall on carbon density (L opez-Medellín and Ezcurra 2012;Hamilton and Lovette 2015). These findings suggest that in areas where high annual rainfall boosts mangrove productivity and allochthonous organic matter deposition, sediments have higher carbon density, presumably because the delivery of organic detritus is greater relative to inorganic sedimentation than in drier regions.Beyond this simple, climate-driven model of mangrove productivity and burial, some studies have recognized that patterns in local coastal geomorphology also drive variation in mangrove carbon cycling. Rovai et al. (2018) showed large differences in sediment carbon density across mangrove geomorphic settings around the world, and that previous global models had underestimated these densities in some settings, such as karsts. The impact of anthropogenic nutrient delivery to mangrove productivity and carbon sequestration has been explored (Kristensen et al. 2008;Mcleod et al. 2011), with a range of results, suggesting a role for nutrient limitation status in controlling carbon cycling. Atwood et al. (2015) review evidence that blue carbon ecosystems with intact top predator populations increase biomass and sediment carbon content.

The aspect of mangrove and other blue carbon ecosystems' carbon cycling that is most relevant to mitigating climate change, however, is their longterm storage of carbon, not their instantaneous rates of uptake. For that reason, an indispensable element of understanding mangroves' capacity for climate change mitigation is the analysis of sites' histories of accumulation from the time of wetland formation to the extant forest with its current rate of carbon production. Thus, this study places focus on understanding variation in sediment depth, as an integration of sediment accretion over time, in addition to that of carbon density, which itself varies over the sediment record in association with shifting productivity and burial.",False,False,False,

In light of the propensity for mangrove peat to accumulate in accommodation of relative sealevel rise (RSLR, relative to vertical land movements) (McKee et al. 2007;Ezcurra et al. 2016;Rogers et al. 2019), we also hypothesize ( 2) that mangrove sediment depth is greater in areas where recent RSLR has been more rapid. Finally, because of the role of coastal geomorphology in setting the sensitivity of mangrove peat accumulation to RSLR (Ezcurra et al. 2016), we hypothesize (3) that the effect of RSLR on sediment depth is more positive in areas with steeper coastal slopes.These hypotheses focus on variation in two quantities, sediment carbon density and total sediment depth, possibly shaped by different environmental drivers, the former reflecting plant productivity and burial efficiency and the latter accretion and wetland persistence over millennia.

## Overview of regional sampling areas
In field campaigns from 2014 to 2017, we sampled mangrove sediments at 80 sites across four areas of the American tropics and subtropics: the Baja Peninsula of Mexico, the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, and the Caribbean and Pacific coasts of Panama (Fig. 1). These sampling areas encompass a wide geographic, climatic, and geological range. The Galapagos are situated on the equator, Panamanian areas in the center of the tropical zone between 7 N and 10 N, and the sites on the Baja Peninsula from just north of the Tropic of Cancer at 24 N to 29 N near the northern limit of mangroves on the west coast of North America. Climatic conditions varied from warm, semi-arid, and seasonal equatorial conditions in the Galapagos (Trueman and d'Ozouville 2010) to the more consistent, warm, and rainy tropical conditions of Panama (Lovelock et al. 2005;McGowan et al. 2010) and the arid and highly variable subtropical conditions on the Baja Peninsula (Rebman and Roberts 2012). The geological settings of each region are distinct as well, with mangroves inhabiting rocky coasts formed from lava flows of varying age in the Galapagos (Simkin 1984), CaCO 3 -rich coastal sediments in Caribbean Panama (C. Panama) (Coates et al. 2005), estuaries and sedimentary island formations in Pacific Panama (P. Panama) (Coates et al. 2004), and protected, sandy bays among coastal hillsides on the Baja Peninsula (Pedrín-Avilés et al. 1992). Rates of RSLR in recent decades vary among these sites as well, from 0.89 mm yr À1 in the Galapagos to 1.68 mm yr À1 in the Baja Peninsula (NOAA CO-OPS 2018). The mangrove species of all four regions are essentially the same, however, with Rhizophora mangle forming the lower fringe and occasionally occurring alone or in a mixed stand higher; Laguncularia racemosa in a mid-intertidal position, intermixed with R. mangle, or constituting a patchy fringe in some sandy or wave-exposed areas; and Avicennia germinans generally in the high intertidal. The only exception to the community similarity among sampling areas is the presence in P. Panama of Pelliciera rhizophorae in the mid-intertidal (Gross et al. 2014).

Within each sampling area, sites were selected in order to give the widest distribution of forests along the coast possible. In a local area, coring sites were chosen by randomly selecting a point along the one-dimensional mangrove fringe identified from satellite images before going into the field. In practice, these coring locations were only truly randomly selected in a subset of cases; often the major limitations of the accessibility of sites in the forest and the time available at these remote sites affected where cores were taken. Within each site, a core was taken 5 m landward from the mangrove fringe, and, when possible, another core 10 m farther in from that location, and so on another 10 m as far as it was possible to extend the transect into the intertidal. Many sites presented narrow fringes of mangrove without significant extent of (or access to) further forest landward. Most sites were accessed by small boat, and we located sites using a handheld GPS device. Though we generally attempted to core at low tide, in locations where the sediment surface was inundated, one person wearing a mask and snorkel guided the corer into the sediment while another person drove it downward. In inundated locations, the snorkeler also held the core chamber closed while the corer was being extracted from the sediment.We sampled mangrove sediments using a Russian peat corer (Aquatic Research Instruments), taking vertical, semicylindrical sections of sediment 5 cm in diameter and up to 50 cm in length. By adding extension rods, we then returned to the same hole to obtain successively deeper 50-cm sections of sediment. We repeated this process to rejection, when the core tip hit a hard substratum of rock or gravel. Each core section was photographed and subsampled with depth at least every 25 cm with depth and just above any apparent change in horizon (of clay, peat, sand, etc.). To ensure that each subsample was of a known volume of sediment, we used a knife and a measuring tape to obtain samples of measured vertical extent, at least 2 cm, though in some cases up to 5 cm when it was necessary to have enough material for a broader set of analyses than are presented in this paper. Each sample was sealed in a labeled glass jar.",False,False,False,
1192,10.1002/lno.12241,8,True,"## Laboratory methods
We placed each sample in its opened jar in a drying oven at 60 C until constant weight was reached (≥48 h). Where field circumstances prevented quick access to a drying oven, we kept the sample jars on ice until they could be dried. We weighed the dried samples to determine bulk density and then homogenized them using a mixer mill and mortar and pestle until they passed through a 500-μm sieve. To remove CaCO 3 , the samples were HCl-fumigated following Ramnarine et al. (2011) before analysis, so that the only carbon remaining was organic. For the samples from the Galapagos, all but nine of the samples were composed entirely of mangrove peat, with no inorganic sediment. Those nine samples were acidified before analysis. The rest, with δ 13 C values ranging from À21 to À26, indicative of mangrove biomass rather than isotopically heavier CaCO 3 carbon, were not acidified (see Costa et al. 2019).From each sample, 6-9 mg were precisely weighed into a tin capsule and run in an ECS 4010 CHNSO Elemental Analyzer, which measures the mass percentage of carbon. Because CaCO 3 was removed or absent from the samples, this value is the mass percentage of organic carbon (%C). For the 179 samples from C. Panama, %C was instead estimated by loss on ignition (LOI) at 550 C. We then submitted 20 samples, chosen to cover the range of LOI values, to elemental analysis to build a calibration curve for the conversion of LOI to %C (linear regression, slope = 2.19 AE 0.13, intercept = 7.60 AE 2.66, F 1,18 = 280, R 2 = 0.94, p < 0.001).",False,False,True,

Individual pieces of root tissue were picked out of the dried samples for 14 C analysis and their 14 C age determined at the KCCAMS 14 C facility at UC Irvine following standard procedures. It is assumed that the age of root material at the bottom of each core represents the beginning of sedimentation at the site. This assumption is supported by the fact that most fine roots of R. mangle, a prevalent mangrove colonist species, are distributed within a few cm of the sediment surface (Covington and Raymond 1989), though vertical mixing of sediment may occur. It is possible that root material sampled may derive from other plants than mangroves that may have existed at a site before mangrove establishment, an important consideration for studies focused on paleoecological reconstruction. Whatever the source of the root material, dividing the depth from which the sample was taken by its age yielded an estimate of the average accretion rate, the net total of variation in accretion and subsidence over time, at that site.",False,False,False,

The bulk density of the sample multiplied by its %C gives the mass of organic carbon per unit volume, or carbon density (in g C org cm À3 ). The carbon stock for each core was estimated by averaging the carbon density of subsamples downcore within a sediment horizon and then integrating the carbon content of each horizon over the measured depth interval of that horizon, giving carbon stock (in g C org cm À2 ). The carbon stock of each horizon was then summed, giving the carbon stock of the entire sediment column (converted from gC org cm À2 to MgC org ha À1 by multiplying by 100). Carbon stock is thus the product of carbon density and sediment depth.Average carbon density for a core is the average of the carbon densities in the samples with depth in each core, weighted by the vertical extent of the sediment horizon from which the sample came. Average carbon density for a site with multiple cores is the simple average of those cores' average carbon density values. Similarly, the average sediment depth reported for a site in which multiple cores were taken is the average of the depths of those cores, and the carbon stock reported for a site is the average of those cores' carbon stocks. To illustrate the effect of depth-normalization on sediment carbon stock calculations, stocks were depth-normalized by multiplying the depthintegrated stock by 100 cm sediment depth À1 .",False,False,True,
1195,10.1002/lno.12241,11,True,"The hypothesized effect of coastal geomorphology on mangrove carbon stocks was investigated by estimating coastal slope using a digital elevation model (USGS, NGA, and NASA 2014). Coastal slope was estimated as: (40 m -E)/D, where E equals the DEM elevation at the coring location, and D = the horizontal distance between the coring location and the nearest point on the 40 m elevation contour. (The 40-m contour was used for this estimate of coastal slope because, for contours of lower elevation, the DEM did not consistently yield points that were landward of our sampling coordinates, due to the limited resolution of the DEM.) Contours of 40-m elevation were created from the DEM in ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 using the ""contour"" tool. Elevation at each coring site was extracted from the DEM at each site's GPS location using the ""Extract Values to Points"" tool. The horizontal distance between each coring site and the nearest point on the 40-m contour was calculated using the ""Near"" and ""XY to line"" tools. The resulting distances were then projected into each of the sites' respective UTM zones to calculate horizontal length in meters.Radiocarbon estimates of the fraction of modern carbon in each sample are corrected for isotopic fractionation using δ 13 C measurements at the Keck AMS facility and calibrated using the OxCal tools to estimate the predicted calendar age ranges (Ramsey 2008), given 95% confidence intervals (CI). Ages and accretion rates are reported as the mean AE 95% CI.Statistical comparisons were conducted using the R software (version 3.6.1, R Core Team 2019). The response variables of carbon density, sediment depth, and carbon stock were log 10 (x + 1)-transformed to reduce error in statistical comparisons due to non-normal distribution and heteroscedasticity. Differences in carbon density, sediment depth, and carbon stock by area and with annual rainfall, RSLR, and coastal slope were tested using fixed-effect ANOVA or the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test or rank-based linear regression when the assumptions for ANOVA of normal and homoscedastic distributions of residuals were not met.",False,False,False,

Average sediment carbon stock, as well as its constituent factors carbon density and sediment depth, varied across the areas studied (Supporting Information Table S2). The distributions of carbon density data for some of the areas were rightskewed and not normally distributed (Shapiro-Wilk test: Galapagos: W = 0.89, df = 29, p = 0.007; Baja: W = 0.90, df = 21, p = 0.033; but P. Panama: W = 0.90, df = 13; C. Panama: W = 0.98, df = 17, p > 0.1 for both), and the distributions were heteroscedastic (Levene test, F 3,76 = 6.1, p < 0.001).

## Overview
The two determinants of variation in sediment carbon stock in mangrove forests, carbon density and sediment depth, were examined in this study. Variation in sediment depth was considerably greater than that in carbon density, which was not positively correlated with annual rainfall, as hypothesized. The relatively little variation in carbon density within geographic areas observed in this study means that the depth of sediment deposits contributes more substantially to the differences in carbon stock observed. Across these areas, sediment depth is positively predicted by recent RSLR, which we hypothesize to result from greater vertical accretion in accommodation of RSLR in extant mangroves where RSLR has been faster.

Though variation in sediment carbon density is the focus of much blue carbon research, we observed relatively similar carbon densities across sites and areas, with only the Galapagos standing out as possessing significantly greater densities. The significantly greater sediment carbon density in the cores from the Galapagos than other areas is a surprising result given the harshness of the islands' environment for mangrove forest development. Though their equatorial position might suggest the presence of more favorable mangrove habitat, the archipelago features arid conditions near the coast, the complete absence of surface flow of freshwater and sediment from inland, and bare and often wave-exposed rocky shores (Simkin 1984). These inhospitable characteristics of the islands, and presumably their general remoteness, are likely the reasons why the Galapagos have been mostly ignored in the larger mangrove literature (but see Moity et al. 2019;Tanner et al. 2019;Costa et al. 2019). Though the lack of riverine flows may partly explain the very patchy distribution of mangroves, possibly shaped by subterranean freshwater flows (Costa et al. 2019), this peculiar feature of the islands may help explain their unusually high mangrove sediment carbon densities. In those coastal environments in the Galapagos where, due to physical protection from waves, mangroves are able to grow and to develop peat deposits, this organic deposition happens in a setting with no source of inorganic sediment. Well-protected rocky coves with narrow and silled mouths shield mangrove environments from wave energy as well as marine-sourced sediment, and the lack of rivers precludes a source of terrestrial sediment. There are a few sandy bays on some of the islands that are afforded enough protection from wave energy to be home to mangroves, and the sediment organic matter of these sites is much more diluted with inorganic sediment, resulting in the large variance in carbon densities seen in the Galapagos (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the mangroves of the Baja Peninsula show a large range of carbon densities because these sites range from sandy lagoons with large influxes of marine inorganic sediment to more protected locations, often high in the intertidal, with deep layers of carbon-rich peat, sometimes overlain by surface deposition of fine, clay sediment. These results underscore the potential importance of coastal geomorphological variables to variation in sediment carbon densities in some extreme mangrove environments.",True,False,False,"The coastal ecosystems being studied are **mangrove forests** in two specific locations: the **Galapagos** and the **Baja Peninsula**.

Total sediment carbon stock is the product of the depth-weighted average carbon density and the total sediment depth of the core.mangrove sediment appears to decrease across the geographic areas studied with increasing annual rainfall. This result should be interpreted in light of the fact that the annual rainfall values for the areas included in this study range from some of the driest conditions in which mangroves live (Baja Peninsula, 89-245 mm yr À1 ) to highly rainy conditions (C. Panama, 3458 mm yr À1 ), but not full coverage of the range of conditions between these extremes. For instance in another study of six Australian sites covering a range of annual rainfalls from 650 to 2025 mm yr À1 , sediment carbon density seems to be greater in the tropical, higher-rainfall sites (Sanders et al. 2016; see the right column of Fig. 2). In addition, the significant negative log-linear relationship found in this study between carbon density and annual rainfall disappears when the model is run without Galapagos sites (rank-based linear regression, slope = 2.68 AE 2.91 Â 10 À7 , intercept = 8.89 AE 0.67 Â 10 À3 , multiple R 2 = 0.01, p > 0.1). Thus, it is likely the unusual characteristics of the Galapagos' mangrove environments that lead to anomalously high and variable carbon densities. As we do not find the expected positive relationship between carbon density and rainfall, carbon density may instead be controlled, at least in these geographic areas, by variation in organic matter dilution by inorganic sediment. This hypothesis is also suggested by the relationship between carbon density and sediment depth in this study, in which the sites with the deepest sediment, presumably because of abundant inorganic sediment supply, have consistently low carbon densities, while sites with shallow sediments have a wide range of carbon densities (Supporting Information Fig. S1). Thus, both by diluting organic matter and by adding to sediment volume, discussed in the next section, sedimentation plays a dominant role in shaping mangrove carbon stocks.",False,False,False,
1206,10.1002/lno.12241,22,True,"## Sediment depth and accretion
Sediment depth varied by two orders of magnitude, ranging from 5 to 427 cm across the 80 sites in this study. A comparison of the sites' log-transformed average sediment depths across areas shows that the Galapagos' mangroves have significantly shallower sediments than the others. The volcanism of the Galapagos results in young coasts, actively reforming, leaving less time for sediment accumulation. In addition, the lack of inorganic sedimentation that drives up the carbon density in the sediments of these forests also reduces the volume of sediment available to fill accommodation space. The P. Panama sites show a large range of sediment depths, as here mangroves form on both open, steep coasts, with little sediment, and estuaries that receive large quantities of inorganic sediment from tropical rivers. The large variance in sediment depth in this area results in no statistically significant post hoc comparison with the Baja Peninsula or C. Panama. The magnitude of that variance, however, demonstrates the large role that sediment depth has in setting mangrove sediment carbon stocks across sites (Fig. 2b).",False,False,False,
1207,10.1002/lno.12241,23,True,"Despite the large variation observed across sites, there is a positive relationship across areas between mean sediment depth and the recent rate of RSLR. A linear regression of logtransformed sediment depth against an estimate of each area's RSLR yields a significant positive relationship (Fig. 4). This result supports the hypothesis that in areas that have experienced significant RSLR, extant mangroves should possess deeper sediments, the deposition of which has allowed them to accommodate that sea-level rise. Several sites from the Baja Peninsula in this study and examined in more detail in Ezcurra et al. (2016) and Costa et al. (2019) typify this phenomenon. However, the negative interaction between RSLR and coastal slope in a linear model of sediment depth implies that the relationship between sediment depth and coastal slope becomes less positive under higher rates of RSLR, contrary to what was hypothesized. This result may be explained by the fact that sites, such as many on the Baja Peninsula, where coastal slope and recent RSLR rates are relatively high are not usually very favorable environments for mangrove forest formation. These conditions may tend to make mangrove forests locally ephemeral, resulting in shallower peat deposits in any given location. Perhaps only a small subset of mangrove sites possesses characteristics that allow for vertical peat accretion on steep coastal slopes to accommodate RSLR. Research at several sites in the Bahia de La Paz suggests that a surface layer of fine clay sediment, rather than an inorganic fraction dominated by sand, is associated with extensive, old peat deposits (Ezcurra et al. 2016;Costa 2019).",False,False,False,

It is unclear, however, to what extent the RSLR estimates in this study based on noisy, individual tide gauge records in recent decades are representative of long-term rates experienced by mangroves across these areas (NOAA CO-OPS 2018). Especially in the geologically active Galapagos and, to a lesser extent, Baja Peninsula, RSLR rates over the last few millennia may likely vary across the 100 s of km within these areas due to fault movements affecting some sites and not others. Local displacement by >1 m of the intertidal by geological activity has been observed historically in the Galapagos (Simkin 1984). As a result, caution is advised in interpreting sea-level rise history of a particular site based on generalizations made across large areas.",False,False,False,
1209,10.1002/lno.12241,25,True,"To address local-scale variation in mangrove sediment accretion, we estimated accretion rates at 11 sites by measuring the 14 C age of organic matter from the bases of sediment cores (Table 1). These data demonstrate widely variable accretion rates. Among the sites from the Baja Peninsula, the inferred accretion rates of 0.76 AE 0.02 mm yr À1 at San Gabriel and 0.63 AE 0.02 mm yr À1 are similar to the rate of 0.70 AE 0.07 mm yr À1 estimated for other mangrove peats in the region by Ezcurra et al. (2016). The rates inferred at El Mérito of 0.54 AE 0.01 mm yr À1 and at San José B of 0.44 AE 0.01 mm yr À1 are significantly lower. In contrast, the rates at Bahia Magdalena, Santa Barbara, San Lucas, and Las Ánimas, ranging from 0.98 AE 0.04 to 2.63 AE 0.06 mm yr À1 , significantly exceed that from Ezcurra et al. (2016). The modern age of organic matter all the way down to 137 cm at Punta Abreojos may imply fast enough sedimentation that accretion rate is not easily captured by 14 C dating. This interpretation is supported by the low sediment carbon density of 0.010 gC org cm À3 at the site, implying significant dilution of organic matter with inorganic sediment. The highest accretion rate estimated in the study, 2.75 AE 0.12 mm yr À1 , was measured at P. Panama's Golfo de Montijo, site of the deepest sediment core in this study (427 cm), with an only moderately old bottom date of 1541 AE 68 yr BP. This site, in a large estuary that receives the sediment of several rivers, is typical of a scenario in which sedimentation is strongly decoupled from sea-level rise trends.

Higher accretion rates observed elsewhere indicate sedimentation in excess of that needed for sea-level accommodation, associated with rapid sediment redistribution in dynamic coastal lagoon systems (Thom 1967) or general intertidal progradation (Woodroffe et al. 1985).

Total sediment carbon stocks varied by a factor of 100 in this study, from 17 MgC org ha À1 at a site in the Galapagos with sediment only 7 cm deep to 1730 MgC org ha À1 at a site in C. Panama whose sediment reached 300 cm deep. The very large range in sediment depths both within and across regions drives the variation in carbon stocks calculated (Supporting Information Table S2). With the exception of the Galapagos, with a mean carbon density greater than those of the other areas, sediment carbon density was similar across areas.Sediment depth varied widely, however, playing a larger role in determining carbon stock patterns. For instance, though the Galapagos has the highest carbon density of the areas included in the study, its carbon stock values are among the lowest. Costa et al. (2019) demonstrated that inter-site variation in sediment depth dominates the spatial distribution of carbon stocks within the Galapagos, and the results of this study support the broader relevance of this finding. The coefficient of variation (SD/mean) of sediment carbon density is less than that of sediment depth, both across all sites in the study and within each area (averages of 0.45 and 1.0, respectively, Supporting Information Table S3). As total sediment carbon stock equals depth-integrated sediment carbon density (i.e., the product of the vertical-extent-weighted average of carbon density and the depth of the sediment column), the greater variation in sediment depth than carbon density means that sediment depth explains most of the variation in total carbon stock.",False,True,True,
1212,10.1002/lno.12241,28,True,"## The role of sediment depth for blue carbon
This study highlights the importance of sediment depth in shaping sediment carbon stocks in mangroves. Though differences in sediment carbon density were observed among the areas sampled, the large variation in carbon stock is due mainly to variation in sediment depth (cf. Kauffman et al. 2018). Thus, to characterize mangrove sediment carbon stocks accurately, both sediment depth and carbon density must be measured. In many sites, the bulk of the carbon stock would be missed by only measuring the top 50 or 100 cm of sediment. Though protocols state the importance of measuring mangrove sediment at depths beyond 1 m (Kauffman and Donato 2012), it is common for field studies not to consider sediment deeper than 1 m (Alongi et al. 2004) and for major syntheses of blue carbon data to assume 1 m of sediment depth and to attempt to model sediment carbon stock as a function of carbon density (Pendleton et al. 2012;Holmquist et al. 2018). Working within the assumption of 1 m of sediment in blue carbon ecosystems is justified as being conservative, or necessary for comparison across studies and regions. We argue, however, that ignoring the major source of variation in carbon stock and focusing on the more constrained range of values of carbon density will not bring research efforts any closer to understanding patterns of mangrove carbon in the real world.",False,False,False,
1213,10.1002/lno.12241,29,True,"We demonstrate the significance of this variation by presenting our sediment carbon stock data for the entire sediment column alongside those stocks normalized to a depth of 1 m (Fig. 5). Normalization moves the Galapagos' stocks from 213 AE 34 MgC org ha À1 , one of the two lowest among areas studied, to 428 AE 34 MgC org ha À1 , one of the two highest. Depth-normalization gives much greater weight to the Galapagos' high carbon densities and also inflates carbon stocks by assuming a sediment depth of 1 m, when in fact most of the Galapagos' mangroves had sediment depths <50 cm. Both the Galapagos' high carbon densities and low sediment depths are due to the lack of sediment supply here, driving investment in belowground biomass production and the formation of peat soils consisting primarily of fine roots (Castañeda-Moya et al. 2013). Normalization also moves the Galapagos from below the global average 1-m-normalized mangrove sediment carbon stock, 283 AE 193 MgC org ha À1 (Atwood et al. 2017), to above average. Conversely, P. Panama, with some very extensive sediment deposits whose vertical extent is discounted by depth-normalization, moves from an above-average value of 347 AE 107 to below average 227 AE 22 MgC org ha À1 .",False,False,True,
1214,10.1002/lno.12241,30,True,"It has been hypothesized that carbon deeper than 1 m is sufficiently buried such that it is invulnerable to human disturbance and thus can be ignored by research with a management focus. Even if it is asserted that only the top meter of sediment is relevant for study, much variation in sediment depth occurs within the top meter, as many sites possess less than 1 m of sediment. The average sediment depth of 43% of the sites in this study is <50 cm, and that of 76% <100 cm. Thus, these sites have lower carbon stocks than would be calculated with the assumption of 1 m of sediment. In any case, the assumption that carbon from deeper than 1 m is decoupled from human impacts on the surface is imprudent. The loss of primarily surface carbon from cleared mangroves has been observed, but processes of carbon loss resulting from clearing are ambiguously understood and take place over many years after disturbance (Granek and Ruttenberg 2008). Moreover, losses of carbon due to mangrove clearing from much deeper than 1 m have been documented (Kauffman et al. 2016). Thus, assuming that carbon deeper than 1 m in mangrove sediments is not affected by surface ecological changes fails to apply the precautionary principle to the management of these systems given our uncertain understanding of the fate of buried carbon under environmental change. In light of these facts, we recommend that the depth of the sediment column be measured in any field study of coastal blue carbon, and that analyses use these depth values to calculate depth-integrated carbon stocks, rather than or in addition to stocks normalized to 1 m of sediment. Also, given the spatial variability in sediment depth, it may be an efficient allocation of resources to conduct carbon density analyses in only a subset of sites in an area, with the rest of the sites only surveyed for sediment depth, a relatively easy and inexpensive measurement made in the field rather than the lab.",False,False,False,
1215,10.1002/lno.12241,31,True,"Further application of a geomorphological and paleoecological approach will stimulate progress in blue carbon research (Twilley et al. 2018), as the study of responses of these ecosystems to past environmental fluctuations allows for better predictions of their behavior under anthropogenic global change (Ellison 1993;McKee et al. 2007;Seddon et al. 2011). The local variation in accretion rates inferred in this study indicates that more paleo-reconstructions are justified to characterize past mangrove ecosystem development processes. Valuable contributions of future paleoecological blue carbon research would include measuring the contribution of specific mangrove taxa to the bulk carbon composition of the sediment column and tracking the fate of buried mangrove peat after the overlying forest subsides to RSLR. Better understanding of how these ecosystems respond to long-term changes in their physical environments will make possible efforts to restore their functioning (Temmink et al. 2022).This study disentangled the variation in the two constituents of sedimentary carbon stocks, carbon density and sediment depth, and showed that variation in sediment depth is the major source of carbon stock variability. Analysis of environmental covariates with these constituents showed that carbon density is not positively correlated with annual rainfall across these extremes of mangrove conditions and that sediment depth is greater in areas with greater recent RSLR. Sediment depth is highly variable within and across local areas, and ignoring that variation skews characterizations of mangrove carbon stocks. Future work that explores how coastal processes form coastal wetlands' belowground landscapes and thus physically shapes their carbon stocks will improve models of carbon distribution. Understanding where blue carbon is distributed will take on practical value for climate change mitigation if it is combined with knowledge of how those carbon distributions respond to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Mechanistic understanding of mangrove carbon fluxes can be sought both from examination of past changes in these systems through paleo-reconstruction and through long-term, integrative ecosystem monitoring of mangroves as they undergo diverse human impact, conservation, and restoration trajectories into the future. As the coast continues to change shape, it is ever more important to get to the bottom of the processes that form and preserve coastal blue carbon.",False,False,False,

## Abstract
This study quantified the seasonal and spatial variability of partial pressure of CO 2 (pCO 2 ) and water-atmosphere CO 2 fluxes in the Parnaíba River Delta, the largest delta in the Americas. It is a pristine equatorial, mangrovedominated environment located in a transitional between humid and semi-arid climates, with marked seasonality in rainfall and river discharge. Major channels and bays were sampled during dry and wet seasons, with continuous measurements of pCO 2 , temperature, salinity, and wind velocity. Subsurface water samples were collected in discrete stations for pH, total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), dissolved oxygen and chlorophyll a quantification. A significant positive correlation between carbonate system parameters with salinity was found in both periods, with salinity significantly higher in the dry season. Strong deviations of pCO 2 , TA, and DIC from two endmembers conservative mixing were found, particularly in mangrove-dominated waters, due to organic matter degradation. The Delta showed high spatial variability of pCO 2 , with the highest values in mangrove-dominated waters, moderate in the river-dominated regions, and lowest in the high salinity areas, suggesting that pCO 2 variability is likely controlled by a combination of river-ocean mixing and biological processes (respiration and photosynthesis). The Delta outgasses about 20 times less CO 2 in the dry season (9.06 AE 11.09 mmol m À2 .d À1 ) than in the rainy season (209.68 AE 250.87 mmol m À2 d À1 ). Our results indicate this large mangrove-dominated tropical delta is an important source of CO 2 to the atmosphere, but a sharp decrease was observed during dry periods.",False,False,False,

Although corresponding to only 7% of the total area of the global ocean, the coastal ocean is a highly active biogeochemical area where several processes and transformations of carbon occur (Gattuso et al. 1998), especially in the estuarine zone (McLusky and Wolanski 2011;Bauer et al. 2013). The estuaries, in their different typologies, are defined as transitional areas between the riverine domain and marine waters, receiving significant inputs of organic and inorganic carbon from different sources, such as rivers, groundwater, mangrove tidal creeks, and the ocean (Abril and Borges 2005;Cole et al. 2007;Cai 2011;Dürr et al. 2011;Bauer et al. 2013;Chen et al. 2018).A delta is a coastal estuarine environment created by the deposition of riverine sediments to the coastline more rapidly than its removal and/or redistribution by tides or waves (Bianchi 2007). These environments are mostly sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere (Laruelle et al. 2013), mainly due to the intense oxidation of the organic matter carried out from rivers and the input of CO 2 -enriched freshwaters, porewaters, and groundwaters (Gattuso et al. 1998;Borges and Abril 2010;Chen et al. 2018;Call et al. 2019). The river flow is a major driver of biogeochemistry dynamics in deltas (Paula Filho et al. 2020), and its mixture with seawater creates estuarine conditions, establishing hotspots of carbon modifications (Bouillon et al. 2005;Borges et al. 2018;Maier et al. 2021). In addition, the close connection of deltaic systems to wetlands, such as mangrove forests, has the potential to increase its CO 2 emissions (Bouillon et al. 2005).",True,False,False,"The context focuses on **estuaries** and **deltas** as coastal ecosystems. 

Here are the specific attributes/characteristics used to define them:

*   **Estuaries:** Defined as *transitional areas between the riverine domain and marine waters*, receiving significant inputs of *organic and inorganic carbon from different sources* (rivers, groundwater, mangrove tidal creeks, and the ocean).
*   **Deltas:** Defined as *coastal estuarine environments created by the deposition of riverine sediments to the coastline more rapidly than its removal and/or redistribution by tides or waves*. They are also described as being *mostly sources of CO2 to the atmosphere* and having a *close connection to wetlands, such as mangrove forests*.

The context also mentions that estuaries constitute only *7% of the total area of the global ocean*."
1222,10.1002/lno.12471,2,True,"The latest global estimate shows estuaries and deltas as significant sources of CO 2 into the atmosphere, with a flux of 0.1 Pg C yr À1 (Chen et al. 2013). This study indicated that the environments located at tropical latitudes usually present the largest fluxes per unit area. However, these estimates still have large uncertainties, mainly due to their great spatial and seasonal variability. Furthermore, tropical estuaries are still under sampled compared to subtropical and temperate ecosystems. Most of the largest rivers in the world regarding water discharge are in the tropics (Latrubesse et al. 2005), and, thus, these tropical estuaries and deltas are an important component in the transport of carbon to the open ocean and in the emissions of CO 2 to the atmosphere.Mangroves are one of the most productive ecosystems in the world, storing and sequestering large amounts of carbon in their biomass and soils (Bouillon et al. 2008;Alongi 2012). Although the whole system is an important carbon sink, most mangrove tidal creeks, as well as the adjacent waters act as a strong source of CO 2 to the atmosphere (Borges et al. 2003). This high CO 2 flux is usually attributed to the exchanges with porewater enriched in pCO 2 , dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TA) (Call et al. 2019); and the metabolic activity in sediments which produce TA and DIC through different diagenetic pathways (Sippo et al. 2016). Therefore, compared to the rivers, the surface waters of mangrove creeks are normally enriched in TA and DIC, and the ratios between DIC and TA can provide important insights into the CO 2 dynamics of these coastal systems (Sippo et al. 2016).The latest global assessment of CO 2 efflux in mangrovedominated estuaries estimated emissions on the order of 34.1 AE 5.4 Tg C per year (Rosentreter et al. 2018a). However, only one Brazilian system was included in this compilation.

1223,10.1002/lno.12471,3,True,"With about 10,000 km 2 of mangrove forests, Brazil is the third country in the mangrove area, containing roughly 7.1% of the total global area (Magris and Barreto 2010). Most of the mangrove area in Brazil is concentrated in the Northern equatorial region (60%-70%), and one of the largest areas is the Parnaíba River Delta (PRD). The PRD is a wave-dominated and tidally influenced delta, the largest open sea delta in the Americas, containing a complex system of islands, multiple tidal channels, and fluvial-marine plains which harbor around 1500 km 2 of mangrove forests (Lacerda 2018). The PRD is considered an almost pristine environment, with little industrial development, and ecotourism and agriculture as the main economic activities. The first research about CO 2 dynamics in PRD assessed the main channel of the river and only two creeks, during the rainy season (Chielle et al. 2023). However, due to the complexity of the PRD, it was essential to extend the sampling to other channels and bays of the delta and to access the seasonal variability, in order to understand the heterogeneity of the PRD and the extension of the estuarine region over the marine intrusion influence.As a protected area, the delta is a key environment in understanding the carbon cycle in natural environments, and how climate change may influence its dynamics. We hypothesize that due to the high variability of river discharge and precipitation, the delta will present marked seasonal variability of pCO 2 values and fluxes, as well as a strong spatial heterogeneity in the processes that control these fluxes.",False,False,False,

## Study area
The PRD is located on the northeastern equatorial Brazilian coast (41 10 00 W-42 20 00 W; 03 10 00 S-02 45 00 S), between the states of Cear a, Piauí, and Maranhão. The PRD is formed by a complex system with more than 70 islands, multiple tidal channels, and fluvial-marine plains colonized by mangrove forests with trees reaching 20 m, and many migrating coastal dunes (Lacerda 2018). In 1996, the delta was included in an Environment Protection Area (EPA) (MMA 2006), due to its great biodiversity and ecological importance in fauna and flora. The establishment of the EPA and the low population density of the area characterize the ecosystem as an almost pristine environment, with small industrial development, and small harbors to attend ecotourism, agriculture, and fishing.The delta is situated on a climatic transitional coast, between the NE semi-arid and Amazon humid climate, mainly influenced by the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the South Atlantic anticyclone. There are two marked seasons (Supporting Information Fig. S1): a rainy period from January to May-June (monthly average = 181 mm) with maximum precipitation usually happening in April (267.2 mm); and a dry period from July-August to December (monthly average: 28.5 mm). The river discharge follows the pattern of the precipitation, generally higher in April (1460 m 3 s À1 ). However, the discharge is also regulated by the Boa Esperança reservoir (around 700 km upstream from the Parnaíba river mouth), and it is never below 100 m 3 s À1 even under very dry conditions. The delta is classified as a wavedominated asymmetric delta, due to its outline and spits west of the river mouth (da Silva et al. 2015). The tide is semidiurnal, reaching amplitudes of 3.3 m during spring tide while it reaches only 1.7 m during neap tide (mesotides) (da Silva et al. 2015).",False,False,False,

The sampling campaigns occurred in March 2018, the rainy season, and in December 2019 and December 2021, the dry season (Fig. 1). Continuous, real-time measurements of pCO 2 , temperature, salinity, and wind velocity were taken by an underway CO 2 equipment coupled with a thermosalinograph and an anemometer. Subsurface water samples were collected in discrete stations for pH, TA, DIC, dissolved oxygen (DO), and chlorophyll a (Chl a) analysis (Fig. 1).

Surface water temperature and salinity were measured by a thermosalinograph (SeaBird Electronics ® ), while wind speed and direction were measured by an anemometer (Davis ® S-WCF-M003) attached to the vessel. Wind speed and direction were rectified using vector decomposition.The pCO 2 in estuarine water and atmosphere was measured using a semi-autonomous underway equipment. Detailed descriptions of this equipment can be found in previous studies conducted in estuarine and continental shelf waters (Pierrot et al. 2009;Carvalho et al. 2017;Cotovicz et al. 2020a;Chielle et al. 2023). In summary, a flux of subsurface estuarine water is pumped to the equilibrators. After the equilibrium with the water, the air is dried and passes through a non-dispersive infrared analyzer (NDIR Li-Cor ® Li-7000, USA) to measure its CO 2 concentration as the molar fraction of CO 2 (xCO 2 eq ). The system, then, calculates the partial pressure of CO 2 (in μatm) from the molar fraction of CO 2 in dry air (μatm) considering surface water temperature and 100% saturation of water vapor, according to (Weiss and Price 1980):
where P eq is the barometric pressure at equilibrium and P w eq is the water vapor pressure (in atm) calculated at the equilibrator temperature.A temperature correction was applied to convert the pCO 2 (μatm) measured in the equilibrator (pCO 2 eq ) to the pCO 2 at in situ surface water temperature conditions (pCO 2 sw ) (Takahashi et al. 2002):
Manual calibration is completed before starting the measurements using certified standards (360, 1009, and 2009 ppmv, White Martins Certified Material).

Water samples for determination of TA were collected in duplicate using 500 mL borosilicate bottles. To preserve the samples, we added 200 μL of a saturated solution of HgCl 2 , sealed the bottles, stored them at a low temperature, and protected them from the light. TA was measured according to the methodology described by Dickson et al. (2007), using an automated open-cell potentiometric titration system. The precision of TA method was around 5 μmol.kg À1 (n = 7 measurements). TA values were adjusted according to certified reference material (CRM, A. G. Dickson from Scripps Institution of Oceanography). Samples for Chl a analysis were taken in 5 L polypropylene bottles. The water was filtered in Millipore ® AP40 filters, and the filter was stored protected from the light, and frozen until analysis. The pigment was extracted from filters using 90% acetone, the extract was measured in a spectrophotometer, and pigment concentration was obtained according to Jeffrey and Humphrey (1975) equations.CO 2 fluxes to the atmosphere
The net water-atmosphere CO 2 fluxes (F, mmol m À2 d À1 ) were calculated using:

We used wind speed parametrizations specific for estuaries to determine the gas transfer velocity (Raymond and Cole 2001-RC;and Borges et al. 2004-BO).

For the main river channel, we estimated the contribution of CO 2 originated within the estuarine zone and from the river to evaluate the relative contribution of riverine water in the estuarine CO 2 fluxes according to the method described in Rosentreter et al. (2018b). The relative contribution of the riverine CO 2 to the overall emissions in the estuary was calculated as:
where F Estuary is the average flux to the atmosphere in the main river channel (calculated from Eq. 3); and F River is the riverine CO 2 flux to the estuary calculated from the estimated river discharge and riverine excess CO 2 (in mmol d À1 ; Borges et al. 2006). The riverine excess CO 2 was calculated according to Abril et al. (2000):
where DIC in situ is the DIC at the river endmember and DIC equilibrium represents the DIC calculated from the observed TA and pCO 2 values assuming equilibrium between the water and atmosphere CO 2 concentrations.The DIC was estimated from pCO 2 , TA, water temperature, and salinity using the CO2SYS program (Lewis and Wallace 1998). The dissociation constants for carbonic acid used were proposed by Mehrbach et al. (1973) refitted by Dickson and Millero (1987), and the borate acidity constant was obtained from Lee et al. (2010). We calculated the error propagation of DIC calculation following Orr et al. (2018). The combined uncertainty of DIC calculation was estimated to be AE 5 μmol kg À1 .## Conservative mixing lines

The data were, then, grouped into the following clusters based on the k-means grouping and their characteristics: marine-dominated; river-dominated, and mangrove-dominated regions (Supporting Information Fig. S2).## Statistical analysis

Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to investigate the correlation between variables, Wilcox to evaluate seasonal changes, and the difference between clusters was assessed by the Kruskal-Wallis test.

Accumulated rainfall 1 week before sampling during the wet season was 47.4 mm in 2018. During the dry season, the accumulated rainfall reduced to 0.19 mm in 2019, and 2.0 mm in 2021. Following the seasonal pattern of the precipitation, the mean river discharge during the rainy season was 1345 m 3 s À1 , while in the dry season it was 405 m 3 s À1 in 2019, and 577 m 3 s À1 in 2021. Overall, rainfall rates during sampling campaigns were lower than the historical average, while river discharge rates in 2018 and 2021 were higher than the historical average for the month sampled.The main measured and calculated parameters in this study are summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The river, mangrove and marine dominated regions were classified according to the cluster analysis (Supporting Information Fig. S2).The spatial distribution of the continuous measurements is displayed in Fig. 2. During the field campaigns, the water temperature remained high and with little variation. However, the average water temperature in the dry season (29.78 AE 0.46 C) was significantly lower ( p-value < 0.05) than in the rainy (30.12 AE 0.66 C).

During the rainy season, the delta was dominated by freshwater with an average salinity of 19.26 AE 13.18. The higher salinities during the rainy period were found particularly along the bays and near the river mouth, mainly during high tide. Salinities higher than 33 were found only during the dry season, when salinity was significantly higher (p-value < 0.05), with an average of 23.81 AE 15.43. In the dry season, the low salinity values were restricted to the river-dominated and mangrovedominated regions, as shown in Fig. 2. The carbonate system parameters (pH, TA, and DIC) also presented distinct spatial variability along the study area, with a significant positive relationship with salinity (Fig. 3). TA and DIC were always higher in the marine-dominated regions. In addition, strong seasonality was observed, with higher values found in the dry season compared to the wet season (Supporting Information Table S1). TA and DIC in the freshwater endmember showed a seasonal difference, with values of 412.0 and 464.6 μmol kg À1 in the rainy period, and 295.3 and 305.8 μmol kg À1 in the dry season, respectively.

Overall, wind speed ranged from 0.32 to 14.98 m s À1 during the wet period, with direction predominantly from N and NE. Winds were slightly weaker during the dry period (4.28 AE 2.40 m s À1 ) compared to the wet period (5.79 AE 2.51 m s À1 ).

## Spatial-temporal variability of TA and DIC
Salinity plays an important role in the spatial and seasonal variability of the carbonate system in the PRD. During the rainy period, when river discharge is high, the salinity gradient extended toward the platform. The oceanic waters adjacent to the delta present typical values of salinity close to 36 (da Silva et al. 2015;Carvalho et al. 2017), but our maximal measured salinity in the wet period was 33.5. The fraction of freshwater, estimated following Bianchi (2007), was 99% at the river-dominated waters, 90% at the mangrove-dominated and 21% at the marine-dominated regions during the wet season. This is a general estimate, using the salinity average values, and can be subject to errors, as there are other factors involved, such as the tide variability. A better evaluation of the freshwater contribution in the PRD is an important topic to be assessed in future studies. Nevertheless, our estimate suggests that, currently, the estuarine region occupies an extensive area of the Delta. The freshwater input can come from the connecting channel, surface runoff or from small rivers that drain into this system (da Silva et al. 2015;Smith et al. 2021).In opposition, during the dry period, with reduced river flow and runoff, high salinity waters are spread in all the compartments of the PRD (Fig. 2). The freshwater fraction was reduced, especially at the marine-dominated regions (5%), but it was still high at the river-dominated waters (97%), and at the mangrove-dominated ones (93%). The salinity gradient was found approaching the mouth of the main channel and in the secondary channel connecting the delta to the coastal embayment. There is a relationship between rainfall and the Table 1.

river discharge, but it was observed in other studies that the discharge does not reach values bellow 261 m 3 s À1 in the dry season, probably due to its regulation by the Boa Esperança reservoir upstream (da Silva et al. 2015), and may explain the low salinities in the main river channel. Furthermore, the water from lateral diffusion coming from the huge mangrove forest (Supporting Information Fig. S4) and dunes can also contribute to the low salinity in the mangrovedominated channel (Dias et al. 2016). This lateral diffusion refers to the water that leaves the mangrove forest during ebb tide, related to the hydrodynamics of the mangrove forest, the rainfall, and driven by the tidal variability and exchange with porewater, also known as tidal pumping (Ovalle et al. 1990;Stieglitz et al. 2013;Call et al. 2019).",True,True,False,"The context studies three coastal ecosystems:

1.  **River-dominated:** Defined by average wind speed of 6.53, with a standard deviation of 3.28, a minimum of 1.04, and a maximum of 13.10, alongside other quantitative attributes related to discharge and salinity.

It's important to note that these ecosystems are further described by a range of additional quantitative data points, including values related to discharge, salinity, and potentially other hydrodynamic factors. The wind speed data appears to be a key characteristic used to differentiate between these ecosystems, though other factors are also considered.

The significant correlations between DIC, TA and salinity in both seasons suggest a high influence of the mixing processes, as some sampled stations followed nearly the conservative lines (Fig. 3). However, certain stations presented deviation above the conservative trend, evidencing an addition of DIC and TA in the estuary, possibly reflecting the biogeochemical processes caused by the tidal pumping processes in the large mangrove forest area of the delta. The interstitial waters, which are enriched in DIC, TA, greenhouse gases, and other compounds as the result of aerobic and anaerobic organic matter degradation that occur in mangrove soils, are then transported from the mangrove creeks to estuarine and continental shelf waters (Bouillon et al. 2005;Maher et al. 2015;Sippo et al. 2016).",False,False,False,
1238,10.1002/lno.12471,18,True,"The deviations from conservative mixing lines of TA (ΔTA) as a function of DIC (ΔDIC) can tell us about the main diagenetic processes taking place during organic matter degradation in mangroves that contribute to alkalinity generation (Borges et al. 2003;Bouillon et al. 2005). The relationship between ΔTA and ΔDIC found in the PRD, indicates a combination of aerobic and anaerobic sulfate reduction and denitrification as the diagenetic pathways of the processes of organic matter degradation, producing TA and DIC (Fig. 5), which is consistent with other mangrove-dominated estuaries (Borges et al. 2003;Bouillon et al. 2007;Cotovicz et al. 2020b;Reithmaier et al. 2020;Santos et al. 2021). The low concentrations of total nitrogen (TN) in PDR, available only in the main river channel (0.47 AE 0.11 mg L À1 , Paula Filho et al. 2020), indicates that the denitrification is probably a minor pathway of TA production, as observed in other pristine mangrove creeks (Maher et al. 2015). It is suggested that the production of DIC and TA, and consequent outwelling of carbon by mangrove tidal creeks, with later ocean storage, may represent an important fraction of the blue carbon sequestration with a potential significance in global carbon budgets (Call et al. 2014;Santos et al. 2021). Indeed, $50% of the carbon fixed by mangroves are not accounted for (Bouillon et al. 2008), but recent studies hypothesized that the outwelling of DIC can explain a major part of this ""missing mangrove carbon"" (Maher et al. 2018;Santos et al. 2021).",False,False,False,

Sulfate reduction is a process which generates TA, however most of the sulfide produced is reoxidized, resulting in an alkalinity consumption (Middelburg et al. 2020). A net gain of TA occurs only if the sulfate reduction is coupled to processes that consume permanently the reduced compounds, like the pyrite formation (Middelburg et al. 2020;Reithmaier et al. 2020). Indeed, pyrite stocks were correlated to TA export in mangrove tidal creeks (Reithmaier et al. 2020). In Fig. 3, it is possible to see that these negative values are restricted to high salinity areas, which are more oxygenated (Supporting Information Table S1). Therefore, not all DIC and TA produced in the mangroves of the delta are being exported, as a part seems to be reoxidized.",False,True,False,

The pCO 2 distribution along the salinity gradient displayed in Fig. 4 represents the distinct spatial and seasonal variations in the PRD, suggesting that there are multiple factors influencing the carbon dynamics. The pCO 2 measurements were well above the conservative mixing curve, particularly in the low salinity zones of the river-dominated region, and in the mangrove-dominated areas. In the river-dominated waters, the excess of CO 2 can be attributed to the riverine-CO 2 that enters the estuary, especially during the high discharge season. In fact, the contribution of riverine CO 2 to the overall CO 2 emission in the main channel was estimated to be around 75% in the rainy season. Freshwater runoff from rivers is an important source of CO 2 in estuaries and can contribute on average to 10% of total estuarine emissions (Abril and Borges 2005), or more (Rosentreter et al. 2018b). The freshwater influence was also observed in other tropical deltas, such as the Mekong and Guayas, which presented higher values of pCO 2 in the inner areas of the estuary during the high discharge season (Borges et al. 2018;Belliard et al. 2022).",False,False,False,
1241,10.1002/lno.12471,21,True,"In contrast, in the dry season, the pCO 2 in the riverdominated waters was much lower, and the contribution of riverine-CO 2 was around 45% of the total CO 2 estuarine emissions. This reduction could be associated with enhanced phytoplankton primary production, as the Chl a values were higher in the dry season in this area (11.71 AE 6.95 μg/L). In the Mekong Delta, the authors associated the decrease in the pCO 2 values of the inner estuary with a reduction of the residence time in the low water season, which favored the growth of freshwater phytoplankton (Borges et al. 2018). Furthermore, the more saline conditions during dry season explained the low values in the delta. Previous study showed that adjacent shelf waters present typical values of pCO 2 around 400 μatm (Carvalho et al. 2017). Moreover, undersaturated conditions relative to atmospheric equilibrium were observed only at the main river mouth and in a portion of marine-dominated waters (Fig. 4) during the dry season. This could be caused by the more intense marine intrusion, the thermodynamic equilibration during the mixing of fresh and seawater, and by the biological uptake (Cotovicz et al. 2020a;Abril et al. 2021).",False,False,False,
1242,10.1002/lno.12471,22,True,"Although mangroves are an important blue carbon environment, mangrove dominated waters usually have CO 2 concentrations highly above than the estuary associated (Borges et al. 2003). In the PRD, the mean pCO 2 values observed in the mangrove-dominated waters are within the range reported in other mangrove systems in the world (Bouillon et al. 2007;Akhand et al. 2016;Rosentreter et al. 2018a;Call et al. 2019;Cotovicz et al. 2020a;Belliard et al. 2022). Maximum pCO 2 values were found along these areas, fairly exceeding the values calculated by the mixing curve, in both seasons (Fig. 4). The presence of processes that add CO 2 in the system through the mangrove tidal pumping (Jeffrey et al. 2018;Call et al. 2019), the intense mineralization of organic matter from autochthonous and allochthonous sources (Borges et al. 2018) and the heterotrophic processes related to the high availability of mangrove-derived organic matter, during the rainy season, could sustain these elevated levels of pCO2 (Borges and Abril 2010).",False,False,False,
1243,10.1002/lno.12471,23,True,"In opposition, during the dry season, the significant reduction of the pCO 2 levels in the mangrove-dominated areas can be related foremostly to the intrusion of seawater. The PRD is a distinct delta that has gone through a lob switching process (Smith et al. 2021). Its western part, where we find the large bays and multiple mangrove creeks, is almost independent of the river (da Silva et al. 2015), and its format can favor the seawater intrusion, significantly reducing the pCO 2 values (Borges et al. 2018). This reduction is also observed in other mangrove-dominated systems, such as the large Sundarbans, where there is a predominance of the waters from the Bay of Bengal, with low pCO 2 and high buffering capacity (Akhand et al. 2021a). The TA : DIC ratio in the PRD, used to give information regarding the buffering capacity of seawater was, on average, close to or below 1 in river and in mangrovedominated waters indicating a low buffering capacity in these regions associated with low pH (Egleston et al. 2010). Overall, rivers deliver more acidified waters (low TA : DIC and pH) to estuaries (Borges and Abril 2010;Cai et al. 2021). By contrast, in marine-dominated regions, the TA/DIC and pH values increase as the result of the intrusion of well-buffered seawater in the estuary, particularly in the bays (Supporting Information Fig. S3).",False,False,False,

This kind of pattern can occur in some estuaries in regions dominated by mangrove influence (Akhand et al. 2016;Cotovicz et al. 2020a), distinguishing from other ecosystems, where the regulation of pCO 2 levels is primarily controlled by planktonic organic matter production and respiration (Cotovicz Jr et al. 2015). This suggests that, although the aerobic organic matter respiration in the PRD is an important source of CO 2 , the excess CO 2 is also likely related to the anaerobic bacterial metabolism in water and sediments (Hamilton et al. 1995), such as the sulfate reduction and denitrification, in mangrove tidal creeks (Borges and Abril 2010).The Chl a values in the PRD indicate the importance of primary productivity. The higher values observed along the main channel, particularly during the dry season, may be supported by the availability of nutrients, as seen in another part of the PRD (dos Santos Costa and Cutrim 2021). However, despite some high values of Chl a observed in the PRD, the values of pCO 2 remained largely oversaturated and no correlation was observed between Chl a and pCO 2 . This confirms that the production and export of CO 2 by the heterotrophic metabolism is much stronger than the autotrophic CO 2 uptake. The marine and mangrove-dominated regions had lower Chl a values, particularly during the dry season, as these areas were strongly influenced by the intrusion of oligotrophic seawater with low Chl a values.",False,False,False,

In both seasons, the PCA returned two PCs that account for more than 70% of the data variance. The loadings from the PCA clearly illustrate the processes and spatial distribution of the stations. The river-dominated waters presented more influence by Chl a and temperature, but as freshwaters exhibited lower TA and DIC. This result is consistent with previous studies of tropical river estuaries in Brazil, which have found that the river endmember tends to be poorly buffered (Cotovicz et al. 2020b). In the mangrovedominated regions, the high pCO 2 showed the importance of the lateral residual fluxes, which increase the TA, DIC, and pCO 2 via the exchange with porewater (Maher et al. 2015), and are strongly dependent on the huge mangrove forest area (Alongi and Brinkman 2011). In the marine-dominated areas, an increase in DO%, TA and DIC was observed as pCO 2 decreased, representing a seawater domain with high buffering capacity.

Estuarine systems and mangrove-dominated waters are, mainly, sources of CO 2 to the atmosphere, and significant in regional and global carbon budgets (Chen et al. 2013;Laruelle et al. 2013). However, the deltaic estuarine system of the Parnaíba river presents a huge spatial, ecological, and biogeochemical complexity compared to typical estuaries. Therefore, generalizations must be considered with caution. The supersaturated levels of CO 2 in surface water with respect to the atmospheric levels showed the PRD as a strong annual source of CO The regions dominated by mangroves exhibited the highest fluxes, as expected in mangrove-dominated channels in relation to the associated estuary (Borges et al. 2003). The estimated mangrove area in the delta is $1500 km 2 , accounting for roughly 1% of the global mangrove forest area (Giri et al. 2011). Based on this area and the fluxes in the mangrove channels, we can extrapolate that the PRD emits $0.34 Tg C yr À1 annually, which corresponds to 1% of the global emissions from mangrove systems (34.3 Tg C yr À1 ; Rosentreter et al. 2018a). During the rainy season, this contribution increases to about 2.7%, as the emissions from the mangrove area in the delta reach 0.94 Tg C yr À1 . These estimates were obtained using seasonal weighted averages, considering $121 rainy days per year and 244 dry days per year (Supporting Information Fig. S1). However, it is important to note that this annual estimate may overestimate or underestimate the fluxes, as this study did not consider different tide regimes or transitional seasons. In addition, the CO 2 emissions from mangrove soil are not included in our estimate. Still, since CO 2 fluxes from these sediments are similar to fluxes from mangrove waters (Bouillon et al. 2008), this would not significantly influence our estimate.",False,False,False,
1247,10.1002/lno.12471,27,True,"The marked seasonal variability of fluxes found in the PRD was also found in other estuarine systems (Jiang et al. 2008;Sarma et al. 2012;Akhand et al. 2016;Rosentreter et al. 2018aRosentreter et al. , 2018b;;Cotovicz et al. 2020a;Akhand et al. 2021aAkhand et al. , 2021b)), and it is mostly related to the seasonality of the saline intrusion and the freshwater discharge. Riverine-CO 2 may contribute largely to estuarine CO 2 , mainly in those estuaries associated with large discharge rates and low residence times (Joesoef et al. 2015;Rosentreter et al. 2018b). River-dominated estuaries are usually stronger sources of CO 2 due to the entrance of this allochthonous river CO 2 (Jiang et al. 2008), as it was observed in the main channel of the river and two creeks of PRD by Chielle et al. (2023). But the seasonal augment of the marine intrusion and the reduced river water supply can significantly change the carbon dynamics and the CO 2 efflux along the delta.

The increase in aridity worldwide together with anthropogenic pressure will negatively impact ecosystems, altering their carbon dynamics (Bauer et al. 2013;Regnier et al. 2013). Only few studies accesses the carbon dynamics in arid and semi-arid environments (Leopold et al. 2017;Yao and Hu 2017;Marins et al. 2023), but they mostly lack a seasonal focus. In these systems, heating and evaporation have a strong additional influence on water chemistry and dynamics (Dias et al. 2016;Cavalcante et al. 2021). Studies have shown that the decreasing freshwater inputs from rivers are related to low CO 2 emissions in estuarine and mangrove-dominated waters. This is attributed to the low inputs of DIC (and CO 2 ) from river sources, as well as the limited lateral exchanges between mangroves and estuarine waters during periods of low river flow (Sarma et al. 2011(Sarma et al. , 2012;;Cotovicz et al. 2020a;Akhand et al. 2021aAkhand et al. , 2021b;;Belliard et al. 2022).

A trend of reduction in the number of rainy days and precipitation in the coastal region of NE Brazil (de Carvalho et al. 2020) together with a shoreline retreat in the western part of the PRD (Ferreira et al. 2021) can result in stronger seawater intrusion and significantly impact the carbon dynamic in the delta, and potentially in other estuarine systems.",False,False,False,

The PRD is the largest open sea delta in the Americas, a heterogeneous complex system with extensive mangrove forests, a variety of channels, large bays and with a very extensive estuarine area. Our data shows that the delta is a source of CO 2 to the atmosphere with well-marked spatial and seasonal variability. Primary productivity, mineralization of organic matter, river-ocean mixing, and carbonate thermodynamic equilibrium are the main processes driving the pCO 2 variability in this system. The huge mangrove forest area contributes with residual lateral fluxes and excess of TA and DIC to estuarine waters. The seasonality in the pCO 2 values and CO 2 emissions indicate a strong control by the marine intrusion and the river discharge. The high seawater intrusion in most channels of the delta promoted a significant decrease in the pCO 2 values and increased the buffering capacity, reducing the CO 2 degassing about 20-fold compared to the wet season. This may highlight an important prognostic of sea level rise and the reduction of precipitation and freshwater discharge in this type of mangrove-dominated system. Therefore, the outlook of aquatic CO 2 emissions in the delta depends mainly on the levels of freshwater discharge, the seawater intrusion in the delta, and the maintenance of the mangrove forest. The large variability between and within estuarine systems, and the strong seasonal changes, highlight the importance of improving our understanding of estuarine air-water CO 2 fluxes, especially in highly heterogeneous tropical estuaries.### Fig. 1 .**Caption:** Fig. 1.
