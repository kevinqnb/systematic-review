They are characterized by being affected by tides, with semi-diurnal tides potentially being low but experiencing extended flooding due to wind influence. They can have salinity above 18 PSU, which enables sulfate-reducing bacteria to outcompete methanogenic bacteria.

*   **Coastal North Sea:** A marine region with sampling sites such as Goeree 6 km, Noordwijk (multiple sites with varying km distances: 10, 2, 20), Rottumerplaat (multiple sites with varying km distances: 3, 50, 70), Terschelling (multiple sites with varying km distances: 10, 100, 135, 175, 235), Walcheren (multiple sites with varying km distances: 2, 20, 70). It is differentiated from the Wadden Sea and Zeeland Delta by sampling site distance (km from coast) and depth.
*   **Central North Sea:** A marine region, specifically mentioned as the location for sampling at Terschelling 100, Terschelling 135, Terschelling 175, and Terschelling 235.



It's important to note that the text doesn't provide detailed ecological descriptions of these ecosystems beyond their geographical locations and the fact they are marine regions. The distinction between these ecosystems appears to be primarily based on their location (e.g., Wadden Sea, Zeeland Delta) and sampling site distance (km from coast) and depth.

It is similar to kelp forests on the Greenland south and west coast, specifically having *A. clathratum* as a dominant component, particularly in sheltered and deeper locations.

2.  **Blosseville Coast Kelp Forest:** This kelp forest is located along a coastline heavily influenced by marine-terminating glaciers, resulting in turbid water and glacier ice. It is dominated by *L. solidungula* along with red algal species, growing on a seabed with mixed substrate types (rock to pebbles). It is found at depths of 15-20m, and exists in a dynamic environment due to glacial meltwater and ice scouring.

3.  **Seaweed Meadows:** These are characterized by low vegetation of *C. plumosa* and *F. distichus*, and includes *A. glacialis*.
